FE6 native instrument information

·"№" refers to instrument number; "#" refers to song number.
·Samples with brackets =same as that № sample.
·For example, №0 acoustic grand saying [1] means it uses the same sample as №1 bright acoustic.

·When using the soundfont in your midi editing app, I suggest using instrument №125 (helicopter) for the drums.

·Keep in mind that any slots that are shown not to have samples here (for example, №23 harmonica)
are set by default as "square wave 1", meaning it will play bleepbloop noises if you use it. Be
especially vigilant with drums; FE6's native drum palette is rather limited and actually erroneously
includes some samples from other instruments. I do not recommend using hardware square waves
as instruments because the GBAFE engine can only play one of these at the same time, and
they are usually already used for menu sounds (for example, the "boopboop" that plays when you
move the cursor on the map).

0x0381254 location of voicegroup for song #1 (the main FE theme). This is a safe place to slap
down the native instrument map if you don't want to put it in your usual free space.
