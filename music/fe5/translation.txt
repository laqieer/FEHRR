Well, here's my take.  Not too bad, except some parts where I don't 
have enough context to tell exactly what it means.  Also, I haven't 
figured out what "yukeyuke" means.  Feel free to adjust names and 
such as I don't know all the official Fire Emblem romanizations (or 
which ones even exist).  And go ahead and add things like "a" and 
"an" and "the" and such, as they don't often have equivalents in 
Japanese.  In fact, I hope you do mess with this; some of it might 
use some revising.  I've put in alternate suggestions for you to 
consider, and feel free to use any others you can think of.

Disc 1

01 - Blow'in in the wind  [it also says "sung by Juliana Schano"]

[The next bit could also be "Army of Leaf" or "The Leaf Army."  
Also, I think it's being used as a command, but I'm not 100% sure.  
So it could also be like "The Army of Leaf Seeks Victory."
09 - Forces of Leaf, Seek Victory - Base
10 - Forces of Leaf, Seek Victory - Charge A [or "advance" or "attack"]

22 - The Threat Draws Near - The Final Chapter
[I hope I'm getting this next section somewhat right..."kakeru" is 
a verb with a lot of meanings and I'm not terribly good with it.  
Also, once again I can't tell whether or not it's being used as a 
command.  Could be "Spreading Justice."  Oh, and "Righteousness" is 
a possible substitute for "Justice".]
