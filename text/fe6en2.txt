@000C@0010@0150Boss!@0003
The residents of the castle have
hidden themselves inside!@0003
@0009@0010@0137Heh, even Eliwood, the greatest
knight in Lycia, can't beat an@0003
illness, eh?@0003@000CHehehe..@0003
You were right when you said@0003
there wouldn't be many soldiers
around here because they're@0003
getting ready to take on Bern!@0003
@0009Of course, who do you think
I am?@0003
But you never know when
reinforcements are going to come.@0003
All right!@0003
Kill off the guys in the castle
while we still got time!@0003
Then the treasure is all ours!@0003
[02]
@000C@0010@0151Hehe, castles ain't the only
places with treasure.@0003
Let's go ransack the villages
and get some loot!@0003
[03]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0156@0009@0017Master Eliwood!@0003
The bandits from Bolm Mountain
are attacking us!@0003
@000CI see... Blast!@0003
If I weren't in this state,
I would teach them a lesson...!@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@0122@0012Mister Eliwood...?@0003
@000C@0014Lilina, you must hide somewhere.@0003
This castle is going to become
a battlefield.@0003
@0008@0080@000B@0012No, sir.
I will fight, too!@0003
@000C@0013Don't be ridiculous.@0003
If something happened to you, I
wouldn't know what to say@0003
to Hector.@0003
@0009@0012To my father?
But...@0003
@000C@0013@0017It's going to be all right.@0003
Roy should be almost here by now,
so if we can hold our own until@0003
then, we can drive off these bandits.@0003@0009@0011@000C@0017
[04]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0017Merlinus!@0003
I want you to send a messenger
to Roy informing him of this@0003
attack immediately!@0003
@0009@0013Y-Yes sir!@0003@0011
[05]

[06]
@0009@0010@0119@000B@0010@0102@000B@0013@0017Oh, it's Lance!
What's the matter?@0003
Why are you in such a hurry?@0003
@0009Master Roy!@0003
Bandits have appeared and are attacking
the castle as we speak!@0003
@000D@0010@0118WHAT!
Is Lord Eliwood safe?@0003
@0009@0014He's inside, defending against
the bandits' attacks.@0003
But I don't know how long he can
last with his illness...!@0003
@000D@0011@000D@0010@0109@0012Excuse me, Lance, is it?@0005
Is Lady Lilina safe?@0003
@0009@0014Are you from Ostia?@0003
Lady Lilina is in the castle.@0003
She should be all right,@0003
as long as Lord Eliwood is with her,
but he can't last forever.@0003
@000D@0011@000BNo...@0003
I shouldn't have let Lilina go to
the castle before me.@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@010B@0013Lord Roy, regret won't solve anything!
We must recapture the castle!@0003
@000A@0010@011CWolt is right.
We must hurry!@0003@000B@0012Yeah.
You're right.@0003@0002
@0013@0008@0011@000A@0011@000BAll right, let's go!@0003
We're going to save those trapped
in the castle!@0003
[07]

[08]
@000C@0010@0137@0013@0017Dammit!
Reinforcements already?!@0003
But they ain't gettin' to
the castle so easy!@0003
[09]

[0A]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015C@0013@0017Hey hey!@0003
Aren't you knights going to the
castle?@0003
This may not be much...@0003
But this is something we'd
really like to offer you.@0003
Please use it well!@0003
[0B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015F@0014It's awful...@0003
Soldiers from Bern were able
to cross the border...@0003
They laid an awful attack.@0003
And even if the allied lords
strike back, Lord Eliwood...@0003
He can no longer stand too well...@0003
[0C]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0164@0014Hey!@0003
If you wanna do well in battle
you better use the terrain wisely.@0003
Like if you're in a forest,
the trees will cover you!@0003
There's no way enemies will have
an easy time in that situation.@0003

[0D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015D@0017YOU! Guess what?@0003
Money is important!@0003
If you don't have it,
your weapons will rust@0003
and you can't fight
without your weapons!@0003
[0E]
@0010@0137@0017You damn idiots!@0003@0002
Can't you guys take on
these dastards?!@0003
[0F]
@0010@0137@0017Wh.. What the..?!
S... Strong...@0003
[10]

[11]
@000C@0010@0102@0012@0017Father!@0005
Lilina!@0003
@000A@0010@0156@0017Roy, is that you?@0003
@0008@0010@0122Roy!@0003
@000C@0013Father!
Lilina!@0005@0003
...
Thank goodness you're all right.@0003
@0008@0011@000A@0012Roy, thanks for
coming this far.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Of course, father.
How is your health?@0003
@000A@0017I'm fine.
I'm still alive, see?@0003@0002
@0017But Roy, you do know why
I called you back here?@0003
@000C@0014I am to take over your role of
leading Pherae's military and join@0003
the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@000AYes.@0003
As you know, Bern has started
to conquer Lycia.@0003
We must follow the ancient rule and
send out our military to protect@0003
the land of Lycia.@0003
@000C@0012Yes.@0003
@000A@0014I really didn't want to send you
out because you were still studying,@0003
but I'm not well... I would only
be a hindrance to everyone else.@0003
@000C@0012Father...@0003@001C
@0008@0010@0122@0014@0017Mister Eliwood,
I will accompany Roy!@0003
My father is in charge of
Lycia's main army.@0003
And I could use my magic to be
of some help to Roy...@0003@001C
@000ANo, Lilina.
You must return to Ostia.@0003
@000C@0011@0008@0011@000B@0010@0122@0012@0017... Why?@0003@0005
@000A@0014@0017With Hector's absence, there is no one
currently sitting on the throne of Ostia.@0003
The people must be feeling uptight as well.@0003
You, being the daughter of the marquess,
must take the throne until Hector returns@0003
and ease the tension of the people.@0003
Am I wrong?@0003
@000B@0012@0017... No, sir.@0003
@000B@0011@000C@0010@0102@000A@0014@0017Roy, first you must go to the Bern border
and meet with the mercenary group that@0003
I have arranged a contract with.@0003
I'll send Merlinus along with you...@0005@0003
He'll be very helpful with his knowledge.@0003
@000CThank you for everything,
father.@0003
@000A@0017You'll be fine.
You can do it!@0003
Go and fight, and show them who you
are, the next Marquess of Pherae!@0003
@000C@0012@0017Yes!@0003@000A@0011@000C@0011
[12]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0109@0009@0012@0017Bors,
I have something to ask of you.@0003
@000C@0014@0017I know, my lady.@0003
I will accompany Roy in his travels
and swear to protect him with my life.@0003
@0009@0013Thank you, Bors.@0003@000C@0011@0009@0011
[13]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017@0005Roy, be careful.@0003
@000C@0017I know.@0005
You too, Lilina.@0003
[14]
@000C@0010@0102@000C@0010@0134@000CRoy, today I will instruct you
on basic battle tactics.@0003
[15]
@000C@0010@0134
First, look at this.@0003
@0002
Do you see the moving square?@0003
@0002
This is the cursor.@0003@0080@0004@0002
You move your cursor to give out
commands to yourself and your allies.@0003@0005
Do you understand?@0003
Good, then let's get started.
I'm sure you have a lot of questions,@0003
But the best way to learn is to
actually experience a battle.@0003
Just try moving around for now.
I'll be here and give you advice as needed.@0003
[16]
@000C@0010@0134First, I'll tell you how to
win a battle. To win, you,@0003
Roy, have to capture the
the enemy's main defense@0003
point. That could be a castle
gate, a throne, or anywhere@0003
that the enemy leader is
positioned. For this session...@0003@0005
[17]
@0010@0134...You must capture the castle gate,
where the cursor is at right now.@0003
I'll tell you how to capture
positions later, so make your way@0003
toward the castle gate. I'll
teach you how to move yourself@0003
around the map.@0003
[18]
@000C@0010@0134Do you see the unit in blue in the
top left? The blue units are those@0003
units are those on your side.@0003
"Units" are the people that
actually move around the map@0003
and fight.@0003
The red units are those on the
enemy side. All right then,@0003
let's try moving. You can
use the direction pad to@0003
to move your cursor around.
For now, it's positioned@0003
on you, so just press A.@0003
[19]
The area in blue is the
area in which
you can move. Use your@0003
cursor to select@0003
where you want to go,@0003
and press A to
move. If you change your@0003
mind, you can@0003
press B to cancel.@0003
Most things can be
cancelled by pressing B,@0003
so keep that@0003
in mind.@0003
[1A]
See the red area outside@0003
the blue zone?
The red zone indicates@0003
the area in which@0003
you can attack. Well, it@0003
seems that there
is an enemy unit in the red zone.@0003
[1B]
If you want to attack him,
you have to move a space next@0003
to the enemy unit. Select a
space and press A.@0003
[1C]
You can attack the@0003
enemy by selecting
"Attack" and pressing A.@0003
[1D]
@000C@0010@0134If the enemy is still standing after
your attack, he'll retaliate. If one@0003
of you is particularly faster than
the other, you'll do a second attack.@0003
[1E]
Look at the red zone,@0003
or the attack range.
For you it was only@0003
one space, but now it's@0003
two spaces. That's because@0003
Wolt can attack
from distance with his bow.@0003
Indirect attacks@0003
are those done from a@0003
distance, and direct
attacks are those done@0003
right next to the enemy.@0003
Different weapons have different@0003
methods of attack.@0003
[1F]
Right now, you can do an
indirect attack with your bow.@0003
[20]
To launch an indirect attack,
you have to be one@0003
space away from@0003
your opponent. Try@0003
moving to one
of the spaces.@0003
[21]
Select "Attack" from
the menu and attack.@0003
[22]
@000C@0010@0134
That was an indirect@0003
attack with a bow.
If you indirectly attack@0003
an enemy that has@0003
only close-range methods@0003
of combat, you
can hit him freely without@0003
fear of retaliation.@0003
However, on the downside,@0003
bows can't retaliate
against direct attacks.@0003
Don't forget that.@0003
[23]
Weapons like magic@0003
and Javelins can do
both direct and indirect@0003
attacks. You@0003
can see that the red@0003
zone is extended.@0003
[24]
Right now, you can launch
an attack with magic.@0003
[25]
You can either attack directly,
or keep your distance with magic.@0003
[26]
Select "Attack" to attack your opponent.
Also, do you remember the@0003
R button's function?@0003
You can hit R to see@0003
help messages here, too.@0003
[27]

[28]
@000C@0010@0134That was a magic attack.
You can attack from@0003
a distance to@0003
avoid retaliation from@0003
direct attacks,
and you can also go up@0003
close to avoid@0003
retaliation from bows.@0003
Isn't magic convenient?@0003
[29]
Choose which weapon to equip.@0003
[2A]
Choose which enemy to attack.
If there are multiple@0003
enemies in your@0003
attack range, use@0003
your cursor to
select the enemy you@0003
want to attack.@0003
For now, there's only@0003
one enemy,
so just press A.@0003
[2B]
Now, press A to attack!@0003
[2C]
@000C@0010@0134
If you take a hit,@0003
your HP will be reduced.
HP indicates the life@0003
of a unit.@0003
If a unit's HP is@0003
reduced to zero,
that unit will die.@0003
Once a unit dies,@0003
he's gone for good.@0003
Also, if you die,
Roy, the battle is lost.@0003
Game over. So be careful.@0003
[2D]

[2E]
Do you see the "Visit" command?
If you select it@0003
and press A,@0003
you can visit the village.@0003
[2F]
@000C@0010@0134If you visit villages,
you can gain items and money.@0003
You can use the items you
obtain with the "Item" command.@0003
[30]

[31]

[32]

[33]
@000CThis is the status@0003
of this unit.
There are lots of them,@0003
like Strength@0003
and Skill, but I don't@0003
want to bore you
by explaining each one.@0003
If you want to know@0003
about them, press R to@0003
see the help message.
@0002All right, press B to return@0003
to the map...@0003
Oh, one more thing. If@0003
you hit the right and
left buttons on this@0003
screen, you can view@0003
more information about@0003
the unit, like his
items and skills.@0003
When you're done,@0003
press B to return to the map.@0003
[34]

[35]
@000C@0010@0134When the enemy's turn is done,
it's your turn again.@0003
The battle proceeds like this
in a turn-by-turn fashion.@0003
[36]
@000C@0010@010B
All right,
I'm going to help Master Roy with my bow!@0003
[37]
@0010@0134Roy, Wolt came to help you.
You're not the only unit@0003
you can move.@0003
You have command over all@0003
of your allies,
but also remember that you@0003
are responsible@0003
for their lives.@0003
And one more thing...@0006@0003
[38]
@0010@0134Do you see where the cursor is?
This is the entrance@0003
to a village.@0003
Ordinary people live here,
so you have to inform them that@0003
a battle is going on.@0003
Move to the@0003
village and select
"Visit" to tell them.@0003
[39]
@000C@0010@0122Roy, are you all right?
I'll help you with my magic!@0003
[3A]

[3B]
@000C@0010@0134
Do you think have a@0003
good grasp on battle now?@0003
All right, now I'll tell@0003
you about a very@0003
important weapon...@0003
information. Almost
anywhere, you can@0003
press R to view help@0003
messages about things.@0003
For example, you can
move the cursor to a@0003
unit and press R to@0003
view his personal data.@0003
You can also press
R on the "Attack" and@0003
"End" commands to see@0003
help messages about them.@0003
If there's something
you're unsure of, just press R.@0003
[3C]
@0009@0010@0134
We're approaching@0003
the castle.@0003
Like I said before,@0003
you have to
capture the castle@0003
gate, where the@0003
enemy leader is@0003
positioned. Right
now it's Bors, so@0003
you have to go@0003
up and defeat him. Then,@0003
you have
to use the "Capture" command@0003
to win the battle.@0003
[3D]
@000C@0010@0134
Good! You defeated@0003
the enemy leader.@0003
Now Roy has to move to the castle
gate and "Capture" it.@0003
[3E]
Do you see the "Capture" command?
Select it and press@0003
A to win the battle.@0003
[3F]
The "Rescue" command@0003
allows you to carry
your allies to protect@0003
them from harm.@0003
You can only rescue@0003
units that have a
lower Constitution than@0003
you. You can see@0003
your Constitution and@0003
Rescue statistics on
your personal data screen.@0003
When you rescue@0003
a unit, you can release@0003
them do a space
next to you by selecting@0003
the "Release"@0003
command. You can't do@0003
both at once, though.@0003
[40]
The "Trade" command@0003
allows you to trade
items with units next@0003
to you. If you@0003
select the command@0003
and press A, each
unit's inventory will@0003
be displayed. You@0003
select which items you@0003
want to trade with
the A button. If you@0003
just want to give or@0003
take items, trade the@0003
item with an empty
space. If you give all@0003
your weapons to@0003
another unit, you won't@0003
be able to fight,
so be careful.@0003
[41]

[42]
This is the unit menu.@0003
These are commands
that you can give to@0003
your units.@0003
Right now,@0003
the "Item" and "End" commands
are showing.
You can select which command@0003
to issue with@0003
the A button. The "Item" command
allows you@0003
to equip and use items.@0003
You can also discard@0003
items. If there's nothing to do,
select "End"@0003
to end that unit's turn. You can cancel using@0003
the B button.@0003
[43]

[44]
@000C@0010@0134
How are you doing?@0003
I'll tell you about the map menu now.
Move the cursor to an empty space@0003
and press A. You can see what each
command does by using the R button.@0003
[45]
If you press A when the@0003
cursor is on an unoccupied space,@0003
the map menu appears. For now,@0003
look at the bottom command.@0003
You can choose "End" to end your@0003
phase before moving@0003
all of your units. Just select it and@0003
press A. If you want to return@0003
to the map, press B.@0003
[46]
@0010@0134Roy...! How could you die?@0003
...Is what I would be saying if
this was a real battle.@0003
the battle is lost.@0003
Don't be discouraged...
we'll try again tomorrow.@0003
Let's go back and get some rest.@0003
[47]
@0010@0122
Roy... If this was a real battle,@0003
I would be dead. Be careful in a
real fight, okay...?@0003
[48]
@0010@010B
M-Master Roy...@0003
This is only a training session,@0003
so I'm fine, but if this were@0003
a real battle, I would be dead.
Dead allies are gone forever,@0003
so please bare that in mind.@0003
[49]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015C
Thank you. Please don't forget to@0003
inform the villagers when a real
battle occurs as well.@0003
[4A]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0134
Good, you've captured
the castle gate.@0003
That's the end of our
session for today.@0003
How did it feel?@0003
If you ever get caught
up in a real battle,@0003
just remember what
you learned.@0003
You'll be just fine.@0003
[4B]
@0010@0109Ah, so you have made it here.
This is a training session,@0003
but a battle all the same.
I won't go easy on you!@0003
[4C]
@0010@0109W-Well... Very good.@0003
[4D]
@000C@0010@012E@0009@0010@0138@000C@0017What I'm asking is where
the princess is!@0003
@0009Y-Yes Captain Miledy...@0003
I'm certain she was in her
room this morning.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0013I've already heard that!@0003

What I want to know is where the
the princess is at this moment!@0003@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0012Um... She's... Er...@0003
@000B@0013We're almost going into
head on war with Lycia.@0003
What if something happens
to the princess?@0003
Can you take responsibility?@0003
@0008@0012@0016......@0003
@000B@0014@0016I never should have let her@0005
Highness go down to the border@0003
@0014in the first place.@0003
I will return to Bern and inform
the king about this matter.@0003
I'll try not to make it into
a panic, so you must find the@0003
princess as soon as possible.@0003
@0008@0012Yes ma'am!@0003
[4E]
@000C@0010@0138@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0013@0017Is Princess Guinevere
still with us?@0003
@0009@0012Yes sir, she's under constant
monitoring in the basement room.@0003
@000C@0014Good.
Don't let her escape.@0003
@0009Sir...
Are you sure this is@0003
a good idea?@0003
@000C@0014@0017Don't worry!@0003
Bern has plenty of enemies.@0003
The younger sister of King Zephiel...@0003
We'll be sure to get a hefty amount
of money by turning her in to one@0003
of their foes.@0003
@0009@0017@0016.....@0016@0003
@000CWe're not going to make it anywhere
by serving our country, anyway,@0003
so we're better off thinking of ways
to make money fast, no?@0003
@0009Yes, of course sir.@0003
... But, there is one little
problem with that plan...@0003
@000C?
What do you mean?@0003
@0009I just received a report...
it seems that Princess Guinevere's@0003
servant has escaped...@0003
@000CWhat?! @0005You fool, why didn't@0005
you say so earlier?@0003@0002
Go search for her immediately!@0005
Don't let her get away!@0003
[4F]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017Master Roy,
it's around here somewhere.@0003
@000CThis is where we're supposed
to meet the mercenary band?@0003
@0009@0013Yes, though, it seems@0003
they aren't here yet.@0003
@0002Oh wait, I can see somebody
@0005running this way...@0003

[50]
@000C@0010@010F@0009@0010@0102@0017
Watch out!@0003
@000COh, excuse me!
I was in a hurry...@0003
@0009@0017No, it's all right.
I'm fine, but are you okay?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I'm fine.
Thank you.@0003
@0009@0017It's good that you're
not hurt.@0003
@000C@0017... You are from Lycia,
are you not?@0003
@0009@0017Yes.@0003
I am the son of the
Marquess of Pherae.@0003
@000COh... Dear God!
I thank you for your guidance!@0003
@0009@0017?@0003@0080@0004
@000C@0080@000DPlease, could you help
me rescue my mistress?@0003
@0009What happened?@0003
@000BMy mistress and I were
traveling to meet someone@0003
from the Lycia Alliance.@0003
However, while we were passing
through here, we fell into a@0003
a trap set by Rude, the lord
of the castle just east of here.@0003
We were captured.@0003
@000D@0010@0154
Master Roy!@0003
We must not get into unnecessary
entanglements with Bern now!@0003
@0009But we can't neglect a person who has
come to meet someone from the Alliance.@0003
... But, it isn't smart to charge
into enemy fields either...@0003@0002
...!@0003
[51]
@0009@0010@01D7
@0017There they are!@0005@0003
Hey guys, over here!
Get the servant girl!@0003
@0009It doesn't matter whether
she's dead or alive!@0003
[52]
@000C@0010@010F@0017Oh, no...@0003@0011
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
Well, Merlinus, they attacked first.
We have to fight, don't we?@0003
@0009You won't pay heed of me,
now will you?@0003
I guess I can be witness to how
much you have learned in Ostia.@0003
@000CAlright!
We're going to charge the castle!@0003
Miss Ellen, you can
hide some place safe...@0003
@0009@0011@0009@0010@010FNo, I will accompany you.@0003
I cannot fight, but I
can heal wounded allies.@0003
@000C@0012Oh...
But...@0003
@0009@0014I'm the one that got you
tangled up in this mess.@0003
Please let me be of some help.@0003
@000COkay, but please
don't strain yourself.@0003
@0009Yes, thank you
for your consideration.@0003
[53]
@000C@0010@0115@0017They should be around
here somewhere...@0003
@0017Thany, @0009@0010@0129@000Ccould you go and check to see
if the Pherae Army is around here?@0003
@0009@0012Sure!@0003
[54]
@0009@0010@011E@000C@0010@0115@0009@0014Dieck, who's our
client this time?@0003
@000C@0013The Pherae family,@0005
one of the nobles of Lycia.@0003
The marquess's son is going to
join the Lycia Alliance.@0003
@0009@0011@0009@0010@011F@0017So we're going up
against Bern?@0003
@000C@0012@0017That's what it looks like.@0003
@0009@0011@0009@0010@011E@0013A worthy opponent!
Time to show some skill, eh?@0003
@0009@0011@0009@0010@011F@0017Bern... this one's going to be tough.
Better be careful.@0003
[55]
@0009@0010@0129@000C@0010@0115@0009@0014I think I've found them!
@0017But it looks like they're@0003
fighting somebody down there.@0003
@000C@0013What, a battle's@0005
already started?@0003
We better hurry!@0003
[56]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@0102@0009@0013Are you Roy
of the Pherae family?@0003
@000C@0012@0017Who are you?@0003
@0009@0013@0017I'm Dieck.@0003
I think you've heard the news
from an old guy named Merlinus.@0003
@000CSo you're the leader
of the mercenary band?@0003
@0009@0013It's just a little group, really.
I'm sorry we're late,@0003
@0014I didn't think that a
battle was already going on.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Well...
We have our issues...@0003
@0009@0014@0017No no, we're not blaming
you for it.@0003
Actually, everyone's all excited
and saying that they can show@0003
off their skills already.@0003
@000C@0013Thank you.
That is encouraging to hear.@0003
@0009@0012All right then, let's get
this battle over with, shall we?@0003
[57]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015FWelcome!@0003
I don't have much to say,
for I am not that cool...@0003
But beware of Pegasi
and arrows!@0003
They can take them down
in a single hit!@0003
[58]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0160Oh, you really saved us!
If those people got into our village,@0003
I don't know what would have
happened to this precious sword!@0003
I was really scared...@0003
[59]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0165A bow has great power
against flying enemies.@0003
If they get close,
you can tear 'em apart!@0003
[5A]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0161The three weapons...
Swords, axes and spears.@0003
Remember, boy, swords beat axes,
axes beat spears,@0003
and spears beat swords!@0003
Just remember that and
you will have an easy time!@0003
[5B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015EThe forts are the key to this kingdom's defense.
If you're there, it's much easier.@0003
The enemy will miss easily,@0003
and the damage will be reduced.
Also, your wounds are slightly healed.@0003
[5C]
@0010@0138@0017Damn!@0003
Just when I thought
luck was with me...@0003
[5D]
@0010@0138@0017Ugh... Greed... Only...
Brings you ill fate...@0003
[5E]
@0009@0010@0154@000B@0010@0102
@0009@0017Master Roy!@0003
We have rescued a lady trapped
in the basement!@0003
@000BThat must be Ellen's mistress.
Have her come here.@0003
@0009Yes.@0017@0003@0009@0011@0009@0010@0157
[5F]
@000D@0010@010FYour Highness!@0003
@0009Ellen!
Oh, are you all right?@0003
@0017I never thought you would
do such a brave thing for me...@0003
You had me worried, Ellen.@0003
@000DI wanted to rescue you
no matter what... So...@0003
@0009@0017It is fine, Ellen.
Thanks to you, I am safe now.@0003@000D@0011
[60]
@0009I am in your debt.
May I ask your name..?@0003
@000BI am Roy, son of Eliwood,
the Marquess of Pherae.@0003
@0009Yes...
And I am...@0003
[61]
@000D@0010@010F@0017Your Highness...
Are you sure?@0003
@0009@0017It is all right, Ellen.
My name is...@0003@000D@0011
[62]
@0009@0017Guinevere.@0003
@000BGuinevere?!
That's impossible!@0003
That's the name of the
Princess of Bern!@0003
@0009Yes, that is who I am.@0003
@000D@0010@0154What!@0003
@0005Do you plan on
attacking us now!?@0003
@000BMerlinus, wait a second.@0003@001C
@000DI beg your pardon,
Lord Roy, but...@0003
@001C
@000BI want to speak with her.
Give me some time, will you?@0003
@001C
@000DHmph, if Master Roy says so...@0003
@000D@0011@001C
@000BYou are indeed
Princess Guinevere from Bern?@0003
@0009Yes. I am not sure if you will
believe me, however.@0003
@000BEven if you are not the
Princess of Bern, I can tell from@0003
your actions and your dress that
you are certainly someone of high@0003
social status.@0003
But... if you are indeed
Princess Guinevere something@0003
doesn't seem right.@0003
Ellen told me you are intended to
meet someone from the Lycia Alliance.@0003
@0009Yes, that is correct.@0003
@000BWhy, if you are
the Princess of Bern?@0003
@0009I want to find a peaceful
way of ending the war.@0003
I figured if I could speak
to someone from Lycia,@0003
I could find some solution.@0003
@000BYour brother started this war.
Is it in your power to stop it?@0003
@0009I certainly wish to stop it...
No, it must be stopped.@0003
@000B@0017... I see.@0003
Anyway, will you come with us to
meet the Lycia Alliance Army?@0003
I want to meet Lord Hector and see
what he thinks about this matter.@0003
@0009@0017Honestly...
You will take me?@0003
@000B@0017Yes.
If there is a possibility to avoid@0003
bloodshed and end this war,@0003
then I believe that we must try it,
no matter how small the chance.@0003
@0009Thank you!@0003
Thank you... truly.@0003
[63]
@0009@0010@0148@000C@0010@0149@0013@0009@0017Your Majesty,@0005
we have captured the enemy leader.@0003
@000C@0012Good.
Bring him before me.@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@01BF
@0008@0013You...@0003
Zephiel, the King of Bern!!!@0003
Damn you...!@0003
@000C@0014Ah, Lord Hector.@0003
I must praise your ability of putting
up such a good fight against@0003
two of our Dragon Lords.@0003
I suppose they do not call you
the leader of the Lycia Alliance@0003
for nothing.@0003
However, you were not good enough.@0003
Pray while you can,
for you end here.@0003
@0008@0012Why...?@0003
@000CHm?@0003
@0008@0014Bern and Lycia...
We were always on good terms with@0003
each other.@0003
Even when you took the throne,@0003
we have always paid our respects@0003
towards Bern...@0003
@000C@0013@0017Respect?
@0017Don't be ridiculous.@0003
Lycia... no, this entire continent
must go under my rule.@0003
That is the only way to
liberate this world.@0003
I lack the time to be worrying
about such trivial matters as@0003
respect.@0003
@0008To liberate... this world?@0003
What do you mean...?@0003
@000CIt is of no importance to you.@0003
You are going to die anyway.
Someone!@0003
Take him away!@0003
@0008@0011@0009@0010@01D7
@000C@0014Throw Lord Hector
into the dungeon!@0003
@0009@0014Yes sir!@0003@0011@0005
@0009@0010@0148@0014Your Majesty, I will now
return to the Sacae Plains.@0003
@000C@0014Yes, you may be on your way.@0003
@0009@0014... One thing before I leave, your Majesty.@0003
I beg your pardon, but I do not
think that it is such a good idea@0003
to put too much trust into
sinister people...@0003
@000C@0014Do you mean Idoun?@0003
@0009@0014Yes.@0003
Our soldiers call her the 'Dark Priestess'
and do not approve of her presence.@0003
I understand that she is a Shaman
of great powers, however...@0003
@000C@0014Brenya,@0005
do you not have faith in me?@0003
@0009@0014...! Yes, of course I do,@0005
your Majesty!@0003
I just thought that...@0003
@000C@0014Then all you do is
follow my orders.@0003
Understood?@0003
@0009@0014... Yes.@0005
I will do whatever his Majesty
wishes.@0003
@0009@0011@000C
'Do you not have faith in me?'
Dear, dear, the things I@0003
say sometimes...@0003
[64]
@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@0102@0017So Lord Hector is
still alive?!@0003
@0009Yeah, that's for sure.@0003
I saw some of Bern's soldiers
take him into the castle.@0003
@000CChad, was it?@0003
Do you know the inside
of Castle Araphen well?@0003
@0009I guess.@0003
... Wait, are you guys planning on
going in to save Lord Hector?@0003
I wouldn't try that if I were you.@0003
The bulk of Bern's forces are gone,@0003
but there are still a decent number
of soldiers in the castle,@0003
you know?@0003
It would be suicide to try
and charge them with your army.@0003
@000CPerhaps.@0003
But we can't afford to lose
Lord Hector.@0003
And you said that their main
forces are gone, right?@0003
Then there is a chance we could win.@0003@0009I see...@0003
@0017Then I guess I'll go along too.
I can show you around@0003
the castle.@0003
@000C@0017What?!
No, no, don't feel pressured!@0003
If you could just explain what the
interior of the castle looks like...@0003
@0009I also want revenge against Bern.@0003
C'mon, let me go with you!@0003
@000C@0013All right.@0003
Then I'll be counting on you.@0005@0003@0080@0004
@0009@0017Of course!
Leave locked chests and doors to me!@0003
@0009@0011@0009@0010@0157@0013@0017... Master Roy...@0003@0005
I beg your forgiveness of my
brother's doings...@0003
I didn't think he would invade
Lycia so soon...@0003
@000C@0014My Lady, there's no point
in dwelling over the past.@0003
Please do not blame yourself.
Besides, Lycia is still intact.@0003
If we could get our leader,
Lord Hector, out of harm's way,@0003@0002
we can unite Lycia once again
and fight!@0003
We must recapture Castle Araphen for all
of our sakes... and for Lilina's@0003
sake...@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CLet's go!@0003
[65]
@000C@0010@0121@0009@0010@01C1@000C@0013Thanks for taking care of
the children, Reverend.@0003
@0009@0014Of course.@0003
We of the Elimine Church will take
good care of the orphans.@0003
And what will you do, Lugh?@0003
@000CI'm going to stay here.
I still have some things to do.@0003
@0009@0013I see...@0005
Please do not stress yourself.@0003
@000CYes, thank you.@0003
@0009@0011@000A@0010@0167@0008@0010@0166@000CMake sure you listen to what
the priest says, okay?@0003
@0008@0017Aren't you coming with us,
Lugh?@0003
@000C@0014@0017I'm going to wait for Chad,
and then we'll catch up with you...@0003
@000A@0013Yay!
Chad's coming too?@0003
@000C@0012That's right.@0003
@0008@0014Then I want @0004Ray@0004
to come too!@0003
@000CYeah...@0003
It would be great if Ray came
back and we could all go@0003
together, wouldn't it?@0003@0011
@000B@0010@01C1@0014Children,
we must be off.@0003@0011
@000C@0010@0121
@0008See you later,@0004
Lugh.@0003
@000AHurry and catch up, okay?@0003
@000C@0013Sure...
@0008@0011@000A@0011@000C@0017Sorry...@0003
But I've chosen not to run away anymore.@0003
[66]
@000C@0010@0149@0013@0017Narshen!
@0009@0010@0142@000CWhat is causing all that noise?@0003
@0009@0014@0017Probably what's left of the
enemy are trying to put up a@0005@0003
fight in their last hope.@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@014B@0012@0017Your Highness,
shall we use the Dragons?@0003
@000C@0011@000B@0010@0142@0014@0017No, I do not wish to put the
Dark Priestess through any trouble.@0003
Do not worry, we can handle them
by ourselves...@0003@0008@0012@0017@0016.....@0003
@000B@0011@000C@0010@0149@0014@0016Not this time, Idoun.@0005@0003
Send the Dragons back to Bern,
as we planned.@0003
@0008Yes,@0004
if his Highness wishes it to be so.@0003
@000C@0011@000B@0010@0142@0012@0016.....@0003
@0008@0011@000B@0011
@0009@0010@0142@000C@0010@0149@0014@0016I will be off to Bern soon as well.@0003
Narshen, I'm going to leave Lycia
up to you.@0003
@0009@0013... What shall I do with the remaining
forces of the Lycia Army?@0003
@000CKill all those that
stand against us.@0003
@0009@0017... Does that include
women and children?@0003
@000C@0017Of course.@0003
@0005Annihilate them enough so that they
would no longer even think about@0003
going against us.@0003
@0009@0012@0017Leave that to me, sire.@0005
@0016Hehehe...@0003
[67]
@000C@0010@0142@0009@0010@0139@000C@0017Hmph, I wonder what his Majesty sees
in that Idoun girl.@0003
Well, I think I'll be going as well.@0003@0005
Slater, I'm trusting this castle
with you.@0003
@0009@0013Are you leaving?@0003
@000CYes.
One of the marquesses who turned@0003
against Lycia has a special gift
for me.@0003
He says it's a girl from Etrurian@0003
nobility or something...
Hehehe...@0003
@0009From Etruria?
She must be very beautiful, then!@0003
@000C@0013Yes, the marquess tells me she's still
young but very beautiful.@0003
@0009I would be looking forward to it
if I were you, sir.@0003
Please be careful on your
way there.@0003
@000C@0014You be careful too, Slater.@0003
Don't you dare get defeated@0003
by these remainders of Lycia's
army.@0003
If you do, I will personally
tear you apart.@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0012@0017...
Have mercy, sir...!@0003
@000C@0017Hahahaha...!@0003
[68]
@000C@0010@0121@0009@0010@0111@000C@0013Chad!
You're okay!@0003
@0009@0017Lugh!?@0005
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0012@0017We all fled to here.@0003
@0009@0014@0017Oh...@0005
Where's everybody else?@0003
Are they all right?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah.@0003
The Elimine Church is going to
take care of them for a while.@0003
@0009@0012@0017What about you?@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009@0013How come you're
still here?@0003
@000C... The same reason as you.@0003
@0009!?@0005
Lugh, you're not thinking of...!@0003
@000C@0014I can use some magic!@0003
You know, when I borrowed the Fire
spell from Father's room?@0003
@0009Lugh, don't force yourself.@0005
You can't hurt people, can you?@0003
@000C@0012But...@0003
@0009@0014I'm going to avenge Father.
Lugh, you should stay with the others.@0003
@000CI'm not going to hide anymore!
Everyone, everyone just disappears@0003
when I'm not looking...!@0003
Father, you, even Ray...@0003
I want to fight to protect the people
that I care for.@0003@0002
I want to protect and not be
just protected!@0003
@0009Lugh...@0003@0002
All right then, let's crush Bern as soon
as possible and go meet everyone else!@0003
@000C@0012Yeah!@0003
[69]
@000C@0010@0121@0009@0010@0111@000C@0013Chad!
You're okay!@0003
@0009@0017Lugh!?@0005
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0012@0017We all fled to here.@0003
@0009@0014@0017Oh...@0005
Where's everybody else?@0003
Are they all right?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah. The Elimine Church is
going to take care of@0003
them for a while.@0003
@0009@0012@0017What about you?@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009@0013How come you're
still here?@0003
@000C... The same reason as you.@0003
@0009!?@0005
Lugh, you're not thinking of...!@0003
@000C@0014I can use some magic!@0003
You know, when I borrowed the Fire
spell from Father's room?@0003

@0009@0014I'm going to avenge Father.

@000CI'm not going to hide anymore!
Everyone, everyone just disappears@0003

Father, you, even Ray...
I want to fight to protect the@0003
people that I care for.@0003@0002
I want to protect and not be

@0009Lugh...@0003@0002
All right then, let's crush Bern as soon
as possible and go meet everyone else!@0003
@000C@0012Yeah!@0003
[6A]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0121@0014@0017Excuse me!
You're from the Lycian army, right?@0003
Please let me fight with you!@0005
I don't have any useful information,@0003
but I can use a bit of magic!
Please let me help you!@0003
[6B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015F@000C@0017You're the remnants of the
Lycian army, right?@0003
Here, take this and go quickly.@0003
There are a bunch of Bern soldiers@0005
here.@0003
Bern may govern this whole
area, but we're friends of Lycia!@0003
[6C]
@0010@0139@0017I-I won't lose!
If I don't win...@0003@0002
... Oh... No...!!!@0003
[6D]
@0010@0139@0017Sir Narshen...
Please... have mercy..!!@0003 
[6E]
@0009@0010@0154@0013@0017Master Roy!
We have found Lord Hector in@0003
the dungeon level!@0003
@000C@0010@0102@0012Really!?@0005
Is he all right?@0003
@0009@0013He's severely wounded...@0003@0011
@0008@0010@01BF@0012Roy...@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0013Lord Hector!@0005
What an awful wound...!@0003
We must treat it!@0003
Here, lean on my shoulder..@0003
@0008It's all right...
I won't last much longer...@0003
@000B@0012Lord Hector...@0003
@0008@0013I was taken by surprise...@0003
I never would have guessed that Bern@0003
had resurrected the Dragons...!@0003
@000B@0012Dragons!?@0003
@0008@0014Yes...@0003
The Dragons that we humans fought
in the past...@0003
@000B@0013The Scouring?
I have heard of it.@0003
A long time ago, two races that
each had half of Elibe, the humans and@0003
the Dragons, fought over total control
of the continent...@0003@001C
@0008Right... the "Eight Heroes"...
defeated the Dragons and led us@0003
humans... to... victory...@0005@0003@001C
@000BHow did Bern use the Dragons...?@0003@0008@0014I... have no idea... But...@0003
the Dragons had control of what
is now Bern in the past...@0003
and Hartmut, one of the Eight Heroes
... is the founder of Bern...@0003
Perhaps... the reason... lies
there...@0003
@000B@0012Lord Hector!@0003
@0008@0014Roy... Go to Ostia...!@0003
... You must... lead what is left
of the Lycia Alliance Army...@0003
instead of me...@0003
@000BMe...? But...@0003
@0008Don't worry... in Ostia...@0003
are weapons that... are
effective against Dragons...@0003
@000BWeapons?@0003
@0008@0014I have already told this to Lilina
... Please take care of her too...@0003
She... may seem strong...@0003
But she is still a child...
Please... give... her support...@0003@001C
@000B... Yes, I will.@0003
@0008@0014... Lilina... Just... one...
more...... time...@0003...!!!@0003
@0011
@000BLord Hector!@0003
[6F]
@0009@0010@013A@000C@0010@0142@0009Ah, Sir Narshen.@0003
@000CLord Eric.@0003
I have not praised your wise
decision of turning against Lycia@0003
to come to our side yet.@0003
@0009There is no future for us
if we are to be chained down by@0003
old, moldy traditions, sir.@0003
@000CThat, my friend, is a wise
way of thinking.@0003
Now, where is the gift that
you promised me?@0003
She does not seem to be here.@0003
@0009Ah, yes!
I have prepared her in a separate room.@0003
@0009She is a naive girl, you see.@0003
When I told her that I would
let her meet her brother,@0003
she came right along with us.@0003
@0017You, over there!
Bring her here!@0003
@0009@0011@0005@0008@0010@0103What, is this room?
Where is my brother, Klein?@0003
@000C@0017Welcome, Lady Clarine.@0003
@0008@0017Who might you be?@0003
@000C@0017I am Narshen, one of Bern's
Three Dragon Lords.@0003
My Lady, I shall play with you
instead of your brother.@0003
@0080@000DHehehe...@0003
@0008@0012Hahahahaha!@0003
@000B@0013@0017?@0003
What is so amusing,
my lady?@0003
@0008@0014@0017You?
Instead of my brother?@0003
Take a good look in the mirror.@0003
Your clothing, your hair, your speech...@0003
every aspect of you completely
lacks finesse.@0003
@000B@0080@000E@0013@0017Lacks finesse?!
Me, lacking finesse?!@0003
@0008@0014Comparing you and my brother is
like comparing a turkey to a peacock!@0003
@000C@0080@000DYou, you vermin!!@0003
Saying that I lack finesse,
of all things!@0003
@0008@0011@000A@0010@01D7Sir Narshen, I have just received a
report that Castle Araphen has been@0003
retaken by the enemy!@0003
@000BWhat!
What happened to Slater?@0003
@000AEr...
His whereabouts are unknown, sir.@0003
The enemy has been reported as Roy,
son of the Marquess of Pherae.@0003@0011
@0008@0010@0103@0012@0016......@0003
@000B@0016@0014Damn!@0003
Lord Eric, lock the girl up
in some cell.@0003
I shall have much 'fun' with
her when I return!@0003
You, close down the highroad leading
to Ostia.@0003
This Roy figure might pass by.@0003
@000A@0010@01D7Yes sir!@0003
[70]
@000C@0010@0151@0012Heh... all this crap about Lycia
and Bern or whatever.@0003
@0014People of nobility have so much
to worry about.@0003
Well, we can't complain 'cause
we make our living off of turmoil.@0003
Hehehe...@0003
[71]
@000C@0010@0103@0013@0017They shall pay for locking
me up in here...@0003
@0009@0012... Hey.@0003
@000CIs someone there?!@0003
@0009@0010@0114@0014I'm a mercenary hired by Lord Eric.@0003
He wants to see you.@0003@000C@0080@000FI refuse.@0003
I do not wish to meet with
such lower class people.@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0012...
Just get over here.@0003
@000D@0013Let go! You shall pay!
Do you know who I am?!@0003
@000A@0012@0016.....@0003
@000D@0013@0016Let go, I say!@0003
[72]
@000C@0010@0103@0009@0010@0114@000C@0012@0017I said,
let go!@0003
@0009@0013Shut up.
You won't be able to escape@0003
with all the noise you're making.@0003
@000C@0012!@0005
Then you're...@0003
@0009@0013I've prepared a horse for you
over there by that tree.@0003
Get on it and leave while
you can.@0003
@000C...@0005
Why are you helping me?@0003
@0009@0012I have hatred against Bern.@0003
@000CHatred?@0003
@0009It's none of your business.@0003
@000C@0013Putting it that way only
makes me more curious.@0003
@0009@0012Time's running short.
Go!@0003
@000C@0016.....@0003
[73]
@0010@0114@0012@0016.....@0003
[74]
@000C@0010@0103@0017This is in the middle of a battlefield!
What was that man thinking?!@0003
A proper gentleman should escort
the lady to her mansion!@0003
Well, putting that aside...
I came all the way here on my own@0003
to meet my brother, and now look
at the state I'm in...@0003
What should I do now?@0003
[75]
@0009@0010@013A@000C@0010@0114@0009@0017Ah,@0005
there you are!@0003
@000CWhat do you want?@0003
@0009Our forces are having trouble@0005
out there.@0003
Take some more troops and assist
them.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Didn't you hear?
I said to go help them!@0003
@000CI heard you.
I'll leave as soon as I'm ready.@0003@0011
@0009Hmph, not the friendliest of people.@0003@0005
Well, he's supposed to be one of the
best swordsmen out there.@0003
[76]
@0009@0010@0103@0012@0017Pardon me,
you over there!@0003
@000C@0010@0102Me?@0003
@0009@0013Who else?@0003
You are the leader of
this group, are you not?@0003
@000C@0012Yes.@0003
@0009@0013That is most convenient.@0003
All right then,
you are to protect me.@0003
@000C@0012Excuse me?@0003
@0009@0014Are you deaf?@0003
I said that you are going
to protect me from harm.@0003
@000C@0011@000D@0010@0154Mind your mouth,
young lady!@0003
@0009@0013Please step back.
I was not addressing you.@0003
@000D@0080@000EWhat?!
Who do you think...@0003
@000C@0011@000B@0010@0102@0013Now, now, Merlinus...@0003
It looks like she's being pursued by
the castle's soldiers.@0003
That's why she wants us to guard
her.@0003
Right?@0003
@0009Um, yes!@0003
That is correct...@0003
@000B@0011@000C@0010@0154
What... what impudence!
Our army isn't so lenient that@0003
we are going to take along some girl
who would be of absolutely no use!@0003
@0009@0080@000CMy name is Clarine,
not 'girl'.@0003
And I am not of no use!@0003
I can use these staves to heal
wounded allies.@0003
@000C@0011@000B@0010@0102@0013So you will fight alongside us?@0003
@000A@0014... Yes!@0003
Of course... I would certainly not
ask to be protected without doing@0003
anything in return!@0003
@000B@0017Thank you for joining!@0003
We're going up against Bern,
so we need all the people we@0003
can recruit.@0003
I'm Roy.
Pleased to meet you, Clarine.@0003
@000A@0013I am also pleased...@0003
@0080@000B@0017Hmph! 
I will not be friendly with you...@0003
[77]
@000C@0010@0103@0009@0010@0114@000C@0012@0017Oh!@0005
You are...@0003
@0009What,
you're still here?@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0014"Still here"?@0003
You just abandon me in the middle
of a battlefield, and you still@0003
have the nerve to say that?!
I could have been killed!@0003@0003
@0009Then you're lucky that@0003
you're still alive.
Is there anything else you need@0003
to say to me?@0003
@000BJust a minute!@0003
You are just going to
walk away after abandoning me?@0003
I do not think so.@0003
A proper gentleman should take
responsibility for his actions.@0003
@0009@0012Responsibility?@0005
What responsibility?@0003
@000B@0014If a gentleman rescues a lady,@0003
he must also escort her to her
mansion!@0003
I've never heard any story from@0003
any barf of a man just abandoning
the lady.@0003
@0009@0013...What in the world
are you talking about?@0003
@000B@0014Besides, do you not have a
grudge against Bern?@0003
Then you shouldn't be trying to
fight us, who are going up@0003
against Bern.@0003
@0009@0012What?
Wait!@0005@0003
Is that true?@0003
@000B@0080@000E?@0005
Is what true?@0003
@0009@0014Is the army that you're in
really fighting against Bern?@0003
@000CYes... the leader named
Roy or something said so.@0003
@0009@0012...
All right.@0003
@000C@0012?@0003
@0009@0013I'm going to join your army.
Happy now?@0003
@000C@0012Ah... I guess so.@0003
@0009@0011@000CWait!@0003
The most important thing is not
to fight Bern, but to protect me!@0003
[78]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0166
If you don't have a thief,
you won't be able to open@0003
chests and doors.@0003
Only a thief can use Lockpicks.
But I have a key called@0003
the Door Key, which can open
any door if anyone uses it.@0003
You should thank me.@0003
[79]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015D@0017Everyone here is your ally.@0003
@000CWe're not about to abandon
the land in which we were@0003
born in and change sides.
@000CPlease take this treasured sword.@0003
@000CIt was given to us generations ago.
A gift from the king.@0003
[7A]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015D
@000C@0017I can't believe this war is happening...@0003
Under Bern's leadership,
we will definitely wither.@0003
Here is something that will
help you stand longer.@0003
Think carefully before using it.@0003
[7B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0162The mountain bandits and
pirates attack towns.@0003
Once they destroy a town,
there won't be anything left.@0003
Save the towns!@0003
[7C]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0164In the Laus army,
there are mounted soldiers
who use bows.@0003
This is the nomad tribe.@0003
Everyone wants their military might
nowadays..@0003
[7D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0161
@000C@0017Do you know the main point
of combat?@0003
There are weapons known as
Buster weapons, which defy@0003
the weapon triangle!@0003
[7E]
@0010@013AYou fools who are bound down
by old, moldy tradition!@0003@0002
I shall teach you
the ways of the world!@0003
[7F]
@0010@013AHa...haha... Fools...@0003
There is no future for
those... who try and oppose
absolute power...@0003
[80]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017Master Roy!
The Laus soldiers are retreating.@0003
@000COkay, good.
Tell everyone to get some rest.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
@0009@0011@0080@0004@0009@0005@0010@0157Roy...
Are you all right?@0003
@000CI would have never guessed
that Lord Eric would turn to@0003
Bern's side.@0003
I thought the members of the@0003
Lycia Alliance had a strong
bonding to each other.@0003
Damn Bern!
Playing dirty like this!@0003
@0009... I apologize.@0003
@000COh... I'm sorry!@0003
I wasn't even thinking
about your feelings...@0003
@0009No... you are right.@0003
@000CWe will now proceed west towards
Ostia.@0003
But we can no longer trust the other
marquesses and now that Lord Hector@0003
has passed away, there may
no longer be a peaceful way@0003
to end this war.@0003
My lady, do you plan on returning
to Bern?@0003
If you need anything...@0003
@0009No, please allow me to stay,
if it would not be a burden.@0003
@000CIt would never be a burden!
But why do you wish to stay?@0003
@0009My brother is wrong.@0003
He is dragging the Dragons
into a human war.@0003
If he thinks that is the way to
liberate the world, I must stop him.@0003
@000CTo liberate the world?@0003
@0009Yes, he has always been talking
about liberating the world.@0003
He is saying that this war is
to do so.@0003
@000CWhat does he mean?@0003
@0009I do not know...@0003
But my brother is not the kind@0003
of person that would think
about taking over the world.@0003
So he must have a very important
reason for conquering Elibe.@0003
Still, that is no excuse to cause
war, killing innocent people...@0003
@000CPrincess Guinevere...@0003
[81]
@0009@0010@0150@000C@0010@013B@0009@0013@0017Boss!@0003
Our guys that went down to the
village just got back.@0003
@000C@0014All right, then let's go on our
usual visit down to the village@0003
and gather up all the loot.@0003
@0009Yeah, but boss, something's@0003
different today.@0003
There's an army stationed real
close to us!@0003
They look like Lycia's troops.@0003
@000CLycia? Then that ain't a problem...
They gotta be the remainders@0003
of the army that got@0003
their ass kicked by Bern.@0003
Then we can beat them.@0003
@0009Oh yeah, boss!@0003
@000CWell, we still gotta@0003
take our precautions.
Maybe we can rake up some loot@0003
from them too!@0003
All right boys,
let's take 'em on!@0003
[82]
@0008@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102@0008@0017A villager is here to see you,
Master Roy.@0003
Hey, you, wait just a second...@0003@0006
@000A@0010@015D@0013Oh! Are you Roy,
from the Pherae family?@0003
@000C@0012Yes.
How may I help you?@0003
@000A@0013Sir!@0003
We wish for you to defeat
the bandits here!@0003
@000C@0012Bandits?@0003
@000A@0013There's a pack of bandits that have
made their base in an old castle@0003
near the cliffs.@0003
@000CWhere are the castle guards?@0003
@000A@0014They fled once they heard
that Lycia lost to Bern...@0003
We villagers were left behind.@0003
We spend our days in fear of
bandit attacks.@0003
@000C@0012@0016.....@0016@0003
@000AWe have no one else to ask.@0003
Please, help us!@0003
@0008@001C@0012Master Roy, we must
keep up our pace towards Ostia...@0003@001C
@000CYes, I know.@0003
But we just can't ignore people
in need of help!@0003
@0008Master Roy!?@0003
@000A@0017You will help us?!
Thank you!@0003
Please make use of the gate.@0003
It will take you right next
to the castle.@0003
@000C@0017Okay.@0003
@000AThen I will go and make arrangements
for the gate to be opened.@0003@0011
@000CMerlinus! We're going to the
castle to drive off the bandits!@0003@001C
@0008Sigh...
So full of energy when you're young.@0003
[83]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010C
@0009Thank you, Dorothy.
Please tell Saul as well.@0003
@000CYes, Bishop Yodel.@0003@0009@0011
@000C@0017But where did Father Saul go?
How am I supposed to guard him if@0003
he keeps disappearing?@0003
@000C@0011@000A@0010@0160@000B@0010@010E@000A@0013Er... Father Saul, thank you for
your offer, but maybe not today..@0003
@000B@0014@0017Come now, please don't be so cold.@0003
We can sit comfortably tonight
and you can listen to my preaching...@0003
@0008@0010@010C@0012@0017There you are!
Father Saul!@0003
@000BOops.
Dorothy...@0003
@000A@001C
Well then, good day.@0003@0011@001C
@000BPlease wait!@0003
@000B@0014@0017...tsk tsk...
Now look at what you've done, Dorothy.@0003
@000B@0014She fled because you advanced upon us
with such a scary look on your face.@0003
@0008@0080@000B@0017This is the face I was born with!@0003
Father Saul,
you were hitting on another girl.@0003
@000B@0013@0017You make it sound so evil!
I was simply offering a helping hand@0003
to those poor souls in need.@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0017Why does that have to be tonight?@0003
@000B@0080@000E@0014@0017...Well, putting that aside...
Did you not have something to tell me?@0003
@000A@0017Oh, right.@0003
The Lycia Alliance Army is supposed
to be somewhere around here.@0003
@000CWhat! Princess Guinevere is still
with them, is she not?@0003
@000AYes, if the reports from the
Elimine Supreme Church are accurate.@0003
@000CLet's hurry!
We must go and join that army.@0003
@000A@0012@0016.....@0003
@000C@0016What is the matter,
Dorothy?@0003
@000A@0014You want to join because Princess
Guinevere is sooo beautiful, right?@0003
@000C@0013@0017Don't be ridiculous...
Come now, we must hurry.@0003
@000A@0012Yes sir!@0003
[84]
@000C@0010@0164Oh, it's you guys.@0003
I heard that you were coming.
Hang on a sec,@0003
I'll open the gate for you.@0003
[85]
@000C@0010@013B@0017What the hell?@0003
There was a gate there?
Cunning dastards...@0003
[86]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0162
@000CHold on, you.@0003
Why don't you take this spear with you?
I think at some point a really@0003
powerful Armor Knight used it.@0003
Just a rumor, but he
bested many soldiers with@0003
this lance!@0003

[87]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0163
Remember to always capture@0003
a fort, so no enemies come out!@0003
[88]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0165
@000CWhen the northeast castle
of Araphen was taken...@0003
I was there. The Dragon Knights
of Bern were terrifying...@0003
A dragon engulfed the entire
Lycian army...@0003
Oh Elimine, please tell me
it was a dream...@0003
[89]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0160
@000C@0017This whole area is like
the bandits' garden.@0003
They know about fighting in the
mountains, and they can cross@0003
them just fine.@0003
Oh, how scary...@0003
[8A]
@0010@013BNo one yet has ever stayed
standing after takin'@0003
one of my blows!@0003
@0002
You over there,@0006
you wanna try?@0003
[8B]
@0010@013B@0017Gah...!@0003
No... I don't wanna...
die yet....@0003
[8C]
@0009@0010@0154@000D@0010@0157@000B@0010@0102@0009@0017Master Roy!
Some Priest from the Elimine Church@0003
is here looking for you...
and Princess Guinevere!@0003
@000B@0012He knew that Princess Guinevere
was with us?@0003
@0009@0013Yes. I wonder how.@0003
@000B...I don't know either.@0003
Anyway, I'll go talk to him by myself.@0003
@000D@0013Roy, I will be fine.
I also wish to meet this priest.@0003@001C
@000BPrincess?@0003@001C
@000DThe relationship between my brother and
the Elimine church has been becoming@0003
bitter lately.@0003
I do not believe that the Church
would be hostile to us.@0003@001C
@000BI see. Well then, Merlinus,
let the priest pass.@0003@001C
@0009@0011@0009@0010@010E@0014@0017Master Roy, it is a pleasure to meet
you at last.@0003
I am Saul, a priest of the Elimine
Church.@0003
@000B@0017Nice to meet you.@0003
@0009And also...@0003
@0017Oh!
You must be Princess Guinevere!@0003
You are so beautiful,
as the rumors tell!@0003@001C
@000D@0012@0016...?@0003@001C
@0009@0080@0004@0016Ahem... Your Highness,@0003
I wish to know the location of the
'Fire Emblem.'@0003
You have it with you,
do you not?@0003
@000D@0013@0016!!@0016
@0017How did you know that?@0003
@0009@0014@0017The Head Church in Bern informed@0003
us that the Fire Emblem
had mysteriously disappeared@0003
from the Temple of Seals.
They also informed me that you left@0003
at exactly the same time.@0003
@000D@0012@0016.....@0003
@0009@0014@0016I was sent by the Church to
confirm the truth.@0003
@0017Why did you take the Fire Emblem?@0003
@000D@0013... I wished to stop my brother.@0003
@0009Your brother... Zephiel,
the king of Bern.@0003
@000D@0014Yes.@0003
@0009Do you know what the
Fire Emblem is used for?@0003
@000D@0014...The Fire Emblem is a key that
awakens the sword that was used@0003
to slay the mighty Dragons in the past.@0003
Or, that was what my father told me.@0003
But I am unsure about how exactly the
Fire Emblem or the sword work.@0003
However, the possibility of the Fire Emblem
falling into enemy hands seemed@0003
to worry my brother... a lot.@0003
@0009So you took the Fire Emblem, hoping
that to make your brother believe@0003
it fell into enemy hands so that
he would stop his conquest?@0003
@000DYes... but war broke out anyway.@0003
@0009As a representative of the
Elimine Church, I wish to ask@0003
you this:
What do you plan to do from here?@0003
@000D@0013...Must I answer
at this moment?@0003
@0009@0013Ah, so Your Highness has a plan.@0003
@000D@0012Yes. I have not given up hope
of settling this war without@0003
bloodshed.@0003
@0009@0014@0017I see.@0003
In that case, please allow me to
accompany your journey.@0003
@000D@0011@0009@0011@0009@0010@0157I apologize, Roy.@0003
[8D]
@000C@0010@012C@0017Well, sneaking in here was fine,
but there's nothing worth stealing!@0003
Hmm, the room to the north seems
to have treasure, but the@0003
security is so tight...@0003@0002
@000C@0012... Are those footsteps?@0003@0011@0080@0004@0006
@000C@0010@01E3@0009@0010@01D7
@000C@0013I trust everything is under control.@0003
@0009Yes, our soldiers are stationed
all around this area.@0003
@000C@0014Lead them into the castle
and ambush them,@0003
just as we did with Lord Orun.@0003
@0009Yes sir.@0003
@000CI want Princess Guinevere alive.@0003
The rest you can do with
as you wish.@0003
Now go.@0003
@0009@0011@0005
@000C@0012Hahahaha...@0003
@0014@0017The 'Silver Wolf's' granddaughter,
and now Princess Guinevere...@0003
If we have this much to offer,
Bern will be sure to allow@0003
us on their side.@0003
@000C@0011@0006
@000F@0010@012C@0080@000EHmmm...@0005
Now this is getting interesting.@0003
[8E]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009Well, for once we can get a
good night's rest, Master Roy!@0003
@000C@0017I wonder.@0003
That man said he was
Lord Orun's advisor...@0003
@0009Wagner?
Does he bother you in any way?@0003
@000CHe seemed to be in control of
everything, as if he owned the place.@0003
And we can't even go near Lord Orun
because he's ill?@0003
Something seems wrong...@0003
@0009Hmm... come to think of it, you
do have a point, Master Roy.@0003@0011
@000A@0010@010E@0014Excuse me, Master Roy.@0003
There seems to be an awful lot of
soldiers patrolling the area.@0003
@0008@0010@010CI think we're being spied on.@0003@001C
@000C@0012What?
No...@0003@001C
@000E@0010@012C@0014You noticed?
Impressive.@0003
@0008@0011@000A@0011@000C@0080@000D@0012!?
Show yourself, intruder!@0003
@000E@0080@000B@0017Hi!@0003
@000B@0013@0017And... who might you be?@0003
@0009@0014Aw, we can talk about me later.@0003
You know, I was overhearing that Wagner
guy's conversation in the main@0003
main hall, and they said they're
going to ambush you guys.@0003

@000B@0012Lord Orun would never do that!@0003
@0009Oh yeah, that person's dead.@0003
That dark magician assassinated
him or something.@0003
@000BWhat!?@0003
@0009@0014@0017And he's going to capture you
guys and turn you into Bern so@0003
they can join up with them.@0003
@000D@0011@0010@0154@0017Hold it, Master Roy!@0003
Don't trust people like this
so easily!@0003
@0009@0017You can believe me or not,
it's up to you.@0003
But don't come crying to me when
you find yourselves in trouble!@0003@001C
@000D@0011@0010@0157@0012@0017Roy...
If what she says is true...@0003@001C
@000B@0014Let's set a trap.
We'll pretend like we're leaving.@0003
if Wagner is after us, he'll do
something to persuade us to stay.@0003
@0009@0017If you're gonna go outside,
use the room in the north!@0003
That room leads to the courtyard,@0003
so you'll be out of here in
no time.@0003
Good luck!@0003
[8F]
@0009@0010@01E3@000D@0010@0102
@0009@0017Oh, Master Roy!
Where are you going?@0003
We will escort you into the castle,@0003
so please come this way.@0003
@000DMy apologies, sir,@0003
but I have just received a report
of a matter of importance.@0003
Excuse us, but we must be going now.@0003
@0009Oh... But I surely cannot see you
off without paying my respects and@0003
offering you a place to stay!
Lord Orun would never forgive@0003
me for that!@0003
Please, Master Roy, will you not
just spend one night here with us?@0003@000DDo not worry, I shall tell Lord
Orun myself that you are@0003
not to blame.@0003
I ought to pay my respects
to him, anyway.@0003
Please show us to his room.@0003
@0009Like I said, Master Roy, Lord
Orun is ill and cannot see you.@0003
@000DI am sorry, sir, but if we
cannot see him, then we have@0003
have no reason to stay here.@0003
We are in a hurry.@0003
Excuse us,
but we must be off.@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0012You are leaving...
No matter what?@0003
@000B@0016.....@0003
@000A@0014@0016Then I have no choice but
to kill you now!@0003
Everyone! Attack!@0003
Kill them all, but leave
Princess Guinevere alive!@0003@0011
@000BDamn!
So they were after us!@0003
@0009@0010@010EMaster Roy!@0003
Even if we escape this way,
we'll just be attacked from behind!@0003
@000BThen we'll take over this castle!
Everyone, follow me!@0003
[90]
@000C@0010@012C@0013Whoo,
they're at each other's@0003
throats now.@0003
@0014'Suppose I'll take what@0003
I can while I can.@0003
[91]
@000C@0010@0106@0013@0017All this noise...@0003@0002
A battle?
What is going on outside?@0003
[92]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0102@0009@0012@0017Who is it?@0003
@000C@0013What?
What's a girl doing here?@0003
@0009?...
You aren't a person from the castle?@0003
@000CWho are you?
Oh, my name is Roy.@0003
@0009I am Sue.
Are you causing the noise outside?@0003
@000C@0012Noise?@0003
@0009The noise of a battle.@0003
@000C@0014Oh yes.@0003
We're fighting denizens of
the castle.@0003
It's a long story...@0003
@0009@0013I see.
Then I am on your side.@0003
@000C@0012?@0003
@0009@0013This castle's residents are
my enemies as well.@0003
@000CWhat?
What do you mean...@0003
@0009Please give me a bow.@0003
I will fight alongside you.@0003
[93]
@0010@01E3@0017Damn you,
useless vassals!@0003
Well then,
I have no choice.@0003@0002
Witness my magic...@0003
And bow down before
its power!@0003
[94]
@0010@01E3
@0017No...@0003
My plan...
was flawless...@0003
[95]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0102@000C@0014@0017... So you're the granddaughter of the
leader of one of the clans in Sacae.@0003
@0009Grandpa is the strongest warrior
in Sacae.@0003
People call him the
'Silver Wolf.'@0003
@000CThe Silver Wolf...
I have heard of him.@0003
But what are you doing in Lycia?
Sacae is to the east.@0003
@0009Bern invaded Sacae, so we of the
Kutolah clan have decided to fight.@0003
So grandpa let the women and
children escape to Lycia, but...@0003
@000C@0012But?@0003
@0009@0013There was a traitor.@0003
@0014The Djute clan, who have turned
to Bern's side, ambushed us.@0003
@000C@0012@0016.....@0003
@0009@0014@0016We were all separated.@0003
I found my way into these lands
and I was rescued by Lord Orun.@0003
But his advisor, Wagner, assassinated
Lord Orun and took over the castle.@0003@000CAnd then you were captured...@0003
@0009@0013Is your army fighting Bern?@0003
@000CYes, Bern has invaded
our lands as well.@0003
@0009Then let me go with you.@0003
Fighting Bern will let
me rescue grandpa.@0003
I also want to avenge
Lord Orun.@0003
@000CWe're headed for Ostia.@0003
It's in the opposite direction
as Sacae, so is this okay@0003
with you?@0003
@0009@0014I don't mind.
No matter where we are,@0003
neither our Mother the Earth
or our Father the Sky@0003
will ever disappear.@0003
[96]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Master Roy!@0003
The spy I sent to Ostia has just
returned, and he says that Ostia@0003
is in a state of chaos!@0003
@000C@0080@000DWhat!?@0003
@0009@0014There's been a rebellion among
those who want to surrender to Bern.@0003
@000B@0013Is Lilina safe?@0003
@0009@0014The spy says that she has
been taken as a hostage.@0003
Currently, the rebel group has taken
over Castle Ostia and are fighting@0003
the soldiers who wish to retake
the castle and Lady Lilina.@0003
@0009@0011
@000B@0013We must hurry to Ostia!
Lilina, please be safe!@0003
[97]
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Hey! You're...@0003
@0009Oops...@0003
@000CWait!@0003
@0009Hey, what do you think
you're doing?@0003
Let go of my arm!@0003
Ow! That hurts!@0003
@000COh, I'm sorry.@0003
But...
What are you doing here?@0003
@0009@0017Well, um, you know,
it's complicated.@0003
I have things to do, you see?
Hahaha...@0003
@000C@0017Things to do? Here?
In a battlefield?@0003
@0009@0017Dummy, it's because this is a
battlefield...@0003
... Whoops, better watch my tongue...@0003
@000C@0017Do you have some motive
that we're unaware of?@0003
@0009Ulp..@0003
@000CWait, is that why you
told us the escape route...?@0003
@0009Um, what?@0003
I have no idea what
you're talking about!@0003
@000CWho are you...?@0003
@0009Now, now, don't worry
about such trivial things!@0003@0002
Oh, I gotta go. Bye!@0003@0011
@000CHey, wait!@0003
[98]
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017It's you!@0003
@0009@0017Crap...
Er, what a coincidence!@0003
Hahaha...@0003
@000C@0017...If you're in the battlefield
just to steal, you shouldn't be.@0003
It's not right.@0003
@0009@0017Don't worry.@0003
I only take from the rich who
have plenty of money.@0003
No one's going to starve or anything.@0003
@000C@0017That's not the point.@0003
@0009Oh really?
Then let me ask you this.@0003
You nobles take food and money
from the people living in what@0003
you call your territory.@0003
Who said that was your land, anyway?@0003
And you say you're collecting
taxes, but what you're doing is@0003
the same.
Looting!@0003
@000CWhat?!@0003
But we protect the people
in return...@0003
@0009But you're not!@0003
You're killing your own people,
causing a war like this!@0003
@000CWell.. Bern started to invade,
so we had to fight to defend@0003
our people...@0003
@0009So you can just do anything
you want, as long as you say@0003
you're protecting us?@0003
You can burn down villages
and ruin our crops?@0003
@000CBurned?
We never... !@0003
Wait a minute, was your...?@0003
@0009...My village was burned to
the ground by our marquess.@0003
He said that he had no choice
because he needed to prepare for@0003
Bern's attacks.@0003
@000CWell... that's...@0003
@0009We always had just enough to
eat and survive, and then we@0003
just lost everything...
Our homes... our crops...@0003
And then you say not to take from
other people?@0003
Ha! You shouldn't be talking!
You dastards from the nobility@0003
take from us so you can live
in luxury while we suffer!@0003
@000CI...
don't know what to say.@0003
@0009Sigh. We're getting all gloomy now.@0003
I really don't like talking about
'I'm worse off so you should pity me'@0003
arguments.@0003
But you're the one who started it.@0003
@000CI...@0003
@0009Ah, to heck with this.@0003
It's no fun stealing after a
talk like that.@0003
Well, I guess I better bail
out then.@0003@0002
See ya!@0003@0011
@000C@0016.....@0003
[99]
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Oh! You're...@0003
@0009Hm? ...You again?@0003
These days, you always appear
to screw up my plans.@0003
Do you have something against me?@0003
@000CNo!
I just... wanted to apologize.@0003
@0009...Excuse me?@0003
@000CThe last time we met, I said
some pretty harsh things.@0003
Like calling you a villain when
I didn't know the things you had@0003
gone through...@0003
@0009@0017Oh, that? It's okay.
It's not really bothering me.@0003
@000C@0017But I still think what@0003
you're doing isn't right.@0003
@0009You've really got nerve to
say that, don't you?@0003
@000CSo would you give
me a chance?@0003
@0009A chance?@0003
@000COnce this war is over, I'll promise to
rebuild the villages that were damaged@0003
because of it.@0003
I'll be sure to make good use of
the taxes that they pay.@0003
So until then, I'd like you
to stop stealing.@0003
@0009...@0005
How long would that be?@0003
@000CWhen this war is over.
I can't exactly say when...@0003
@0009And you expect me to wait
patiently until then?@0003
@000CYes.
Would that be okay?@0003
@0009Why?
Why do you tell me this?@0003
Why do you try so hard to
help someone like me?@0003
You should just leave a burglar
like me alone.@0003
@000CWithout you, we wouldn't have
been able to escape Wagner's castle.@0003
Though you probably weren't trying
to help us, you did and you saved@0003
our lives.@0003
We can't just leave our benefactor
alone.@0003
@0009@0017Well well, at the rate
you're going...@0003
I guess you'll be getting in my way,
no matter where I go.@0003
@000CAs long as you
appear in our path.@0003
@0009All right, you win.@0003
I'll stop coming to battlefields
to steal.@0003
@000CReally?
Thanks for understanding.@0003
@0009But, you have to let
me go along with you.@0003
@000CWhat?
Why?@0003
@0009Actions speak louder
than words.@0003
I have to see whether you're going
to be true to your words or not.@0003
@000CAll right!@0003
[9A]
@0009@0010@013C@000C@0010@0144@0017Devias, how is the city doing?@0003
@0009They've been quiet so far, sir.@0003
But the mercenary knights from Ilia that
Hector hired are showing no submission.@0003
@000CHmph! What's wrong with them?
We're telling them we'll pay more!@0003
@0009Well, Ilia's mercenary knights are
known never to betray their masters.@0003
@000C@0080@000DYou fool!@0009@0080@000A@0003
@000BI know that!@0003
General Narshen is going
to arrive soon!@0003
If we don't have Ostia
under our control by then,@0003
he'll laugh at us!@0003
@0008@0013O-of course, sir.@0003
@000B@0014We may have to use Lilina to bargain
with the mercenary knights...@0003
If we use her as a hostage,@0003
they should surrender to us.@0003
But that must be a last resort.@0003
We will fight them ourselves with@0003
the help of Dragon Knights sent
from Bern to crush Ilia's forces!!@0003
Devias, I want you to clear out the
town and guard the castle gate.@0003
I will defend the inside of our castle.@0003
@0008@0080@000B@0012Yes sir!@0003
[9B]
@0009@0010@0154@000B@0010@0102@0014@0017Merlinus!
Around how many of Ostia's troops@0003
have joined the rebellion?@0003
@0009Quite a few, I'm afraid.@0003
They have forgotten their
loyalty towards Lord Hector,@0003
and are simply flocking towards the
one with more power, which is Bern.@0003
How disgraceful!@0003
@000B@0012I see...@0003
@0009@0014But there is good news too, Master Roy!
There is a band of mercenary knights@0003
from Ilia that are willing to join
forces with us and attack the rebels.@0003@001C
@000D@0010@0157Mercenary knights from Ilia?@0003@001C
@0009@0014Yes.@0003
They said that they signed a contract
with Lord Hector that they would fight@0003
Bern alongside Ostia's troops.@0003
@000BThat's fortunate.@0003
But when the mercenary knights hear the
news that Lord Hector has passed away,@0003
that contract would probably be broken.@0003
Do you think it's possible for us to
officially hire them into our service?@0003
@0009I would have thought
so too, Master Roy.@0003
However, they already knew
of Lord Hector's death.@0003
They offered to fight
alongside us anyway.@0003@001C
@000DWhy do they go that far,
when they are mercenaries?@0003@001C
@0009Ilia is a snowy area with a harsh
temperature so the land isn't very arable.@0003
Therefore, sending out mercenaries@0003
to fight for pay is one of
Ilia's main sources of@0003
economic input.@0003
I've also heard that mercenaries
from Ilia put trust over anything@0003
else and that they never
betray their employers.@0003
The rumors are true, I see.@0003
[9C]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@0132@0014@0017It looks like the Lycia Alliance have
started attacking the rebels.@0003
All right, we're going too.@0003
Let's go and drive off
the rebel forces!@0003
@0009@0012Will do, sir.@0003
@000C@0014Wait,
where's Noah?@0003
@0009Ummm, I think he went to
the arena a while ago.@0003
He said he's coaching a young
girl in the sword arts.@0003
@000CThat Noah, a coach?
That's unusual...@0003
Well, no matter.@0003
Once he finds out that
we're attacking the rebels,@0003
he'll catch up to us.@0003
@0009@0012Yup.@0003
@000CAll right,
let's go.@0003
[9D]
@0009@0010@0113@000C@0010@0130@0014@0017Looks like they've started
attacking the rebels.@0003
Well then, Fir, I should
get going soon.@0003
@0009@0014Thank you for coaching
me, Sir Noah.@0003
@000CNo problem.
But I must say you surprised me.@0003
You suddenly came up to me
and said, "I want to fight a@0003
match with you!"@0003
@0009@0017I-I'm sorry, Sir Noah.
It was my first time in@0003
the arena...@0003
@000C@0017If you asked another person,
you would have been killed.@0003
You need to look your opponent over
very carefully before choosing to fight.@0003
@0009And you must not hesitate to surrender
if it looks like you're going to lose.@0003
Right?@0003
@000C@0012Exactly.@0003
@0014You can always win back your money,
but if you lose your life,@0003
it's all over.@0003
@0009@0012Yes!@0003
@000C@0014What are your plans now?@0003
Are you going to stay here and work
on your sword skills?@0003
@0009No. I'm planning to travel
to the Western Isles.@0003
@000CThe Western Isles?
Why?@0003
@0009They're building a new mine there,
and I heard that a lot of people@0003
are going there looking for work.@0003
They must be strong people if they're
miners, so I thought it would be the@0003
ideal place to find people to
fight for my training.@0003
And besides...@0003@000C@0012Besides?@0003
@0009@0014The Western Isles is where my
mother first met my father.@0003
She's dead now, but when she was my
age she was also traveling around the@0003
world training her sword skills.@0003
@000C@0012I see...
You surprise me again.@0003
@0009@0016?@0003
@000C@0014@0016All you were saying at first was,@0003
"I want to become strong,@0003
I want to become strong", right?@0003
So I thought swordplay was all
you had interest in.@0003
But you were training because you
wanted to be like your mother?@0003
I'm so happy to see that you
do have a cute side!@0003
@0009What? ...Sir Noah!
Please don't tease me!@0003
@000C@0012Hahahaha!@0003
[9E]
@0009@0010@013C@0014@0017The reinforcements should be
arriving from the south soon.@0003
Hehe... That Lycia army'll be shocked
when they get hit from behind!@0003
[9F]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0132@0013@000C@0017Excuse me, sir, are you
Sir Zealot of the@0003@0005
Ilia Mercenary Knights?@0003
@0009@0012And you are?@0003
@000C@0013My name is Roy.@0003
I'm the leader of the army@0005
that's fighting the rebels.@0003
@0009@0014You?@0003
@0009@0013Impressive...@0003
I was expecting somebody a
little older.@0003
@000C@0014I am here, respecting the
will of Lord Hector.@0003
@0009Lord Hector...
We've lost a valuable person.@0003
He was a true warrior.@0003
@000CYes, and I want to retake Ostia,
for Lord Hector's sake!@0003
And Lilina's sake...@0003
@0009All right.
Then we'll help you@0003
as much as we can.@0003
@000CThank you for your assistance.@0003
@0009You can thank me after
we've retaken the castle.@0003
Come, we must concentrate on
the enemy right now!@0003
@000CYes!@0003
[A0]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0130@000C@0013@0017You're one of the Ilian
mercenaries, right?@0003
@0009@0012Yeah.@0003
And what do you want?@0003
@000C@0013My name is Roy.@0003
I'm the leader of the
Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@0009@0014@0017Oh! I heard about you...@0003
From now on, is it all right if
I join with you?@0003
@000C@0012@0017Are you sure
that's alright?@0003@0005
@0009What?@0003
@000C@0013Don't you have to ask your
commander if it's okay..?@0003
@0009@0014@0017He told us to join with
the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
That's enough for me.@0003
@000C@0012@0017But did he mean like this?@0003
@0009@0014@0017This is a battlefield.@0005
If you take your time to@0003
check everything with your commander,@0003
then you won't be able to act
quickly in trouble.@0003
It's not good to disobey orders,
but outside of that you can@0003
play it by ear.@0003
@000C@0012I see...
Thanks for telling me.@0003
[A1]
@000C@0010@0132@0012Noah!@0009@0010@0130@000C@0003
@0009@0013@0017Sir Zealot,@0005
I'm sorry that I'm late.@0003
@000C@0014I heard you were coaching a
young girl in the sword arts.@0003
@0009Yes...@0003@0005
She was a little naive,
so I couldn't help it.@0003
@000C@0013Is she not with you?@0003
@0009@0014She said she was headed
for the Western Isles.@0003
@000CI see.@0003
Pity, I thought she might have
been of some help if she were@0003
still here.
But you, who ordinarily wouldn't@0003
Start nosing around into other
people's matters, a coach?@0003
Now that is unusual.@0003
@0009@0013Do you think so, sir?@0003
@000C@0012Yes.@0003
@0014@0017Treck and I were joking around saying
that you may have fancied the girl.@0003
But it is in the arena, so
that probably wasn't the case.@0003
@0009@0012@0016......@0003
[A2]
@000C@0010@0132@0009@0010@0131@000C@0013@0017@000CTreck, we are now going into
the Lycia army's service.@0003
@0009Okay, sir.@0003
@000CHm, not the most enthusiastic@0005
response. You don't like the idea?@0003
@0009Eh?
No, I have no problem with it.@0003
@000COh, all right.
Just thought I'd ask.@0003@0011
@0009Lycia...
Nah, we shouldn't have much trouble.@0003
[A3]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0131@000C@0013@0017You're one of the Ilian
mercenaries, right?@0003
@0009@0012Hmmm?
Yeah, so what?@0003
@000C@0013My name is Roy.
I lead the Lycia Alliance Army...@0003
@0009@0014@0017Ah, then I'm going to be
under your leadership from now.@0003
@000C@0012@0017What??@0005
Is that okay?@0003
@0009Hm?@0003
@000C@0013You don't have to check
with your commander first?@0003
@0009@0014@0017Ah, don't worry about that.@0003
He said we were to join with the
Lycia alliance.@0003
@000C@0012@0017But did he really mean...@0003
@0009@0014@0017"Really mean" what?
We're in the middle of a battle.@0003
If you take the time to check every
little thing with your commander,@0003
you'll be dead.@0003
I'm not going against his orders,
though.@0003
@000C@0016.. All right.@0003
[A4]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0130
@000C@0017General Zealot!@0003
@0009Ah, it's Noah.
You were at the arena,@0003
weren't you?@0003
@000CYes,
sorry I'm late.@0003
@0009Doesn't really matter...
We've just started fighting.@0003
I haven't talked to the Lycia
Alliance army yet.@0003
@000COh?@0003
Don't worry, I just got done
talking to their leader.@0003
@0009Really!@0003
Then it's time for us to submit
to his leadership.@0003
Noah, I leave the negotiations
with the Lycia Alliance to you.@0003
@000CYes sir!@0003
[A5]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0131
@000C@0017General Zealot.@0003
@0009Treck,
what is it?@0003
@000CI just met with the Lycia
Alliance leader.@0003
@0009Ah, did you?
Why didn't you tell me, then?@0003
@000COh, not like that.
I just met with him now.@0003
@0009That's fine.@0003
Then it's time for us to submit
to his leadership.@0003
Treck, I leave the negotiations with
the Lycian Alliance to you.@0003
@000CYes sir!@0003
[A6]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0132@0013@000C@0017Excuse me, sir, are you Sir Zealot@0005
of the Ilia Mercenary Knights?@0003
@0009@0012And you are?@0003
@000C@0013My name is Roy. I'm the leader of@0005
the army that's fighting the rebels.@0003
@0009@0014You?@0003
@0009@0013Impressive...
I was expecting somebody a little older.@0003
@000C@0014I am here, respecting the
will of Lord Hector.@0003
@0009Lord Hector...
We've lost a valuable person.@0003
He was a true warrior.@0003
@000CYes, and I want to retake Ostia,
for Lord Hector's sake!@0003
And Lilina's sake...@0003
@0009All right. Then we'll
help you as much as we can.@0003
@000CThank you for your
assistance.@0003
@0009You can thank me after
we've retaken the castle.@0003
Come, we must concentrate on the
enemy right now!@0003
@000CYes!@0003
[A7]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015E
Hey you, look at this great
thing I made.@0003
It fires arrows MUCH further
than a normal bow!@0003
It's very useful, right?
Right. Just like I thought.@0003
I'll give it to you guys,
I want it with someone that@0003
knows how to use it.@0003
[A8]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0161
@000CThis..? This is the Torch Staff!@0003
It creates light in the foggiest places!@0003
If you're in a fog, you
can't attack or see anything!@0003
It helps to have this when
it works against you.@0003
[A9]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015C
@000CMedicine! Medicine!
This cures anything!@0003
No matter what kind of wounds
you have, this will restore@0003
you completely!
The contents are a secret,@0003
though...
Can't tell you,@0003
or I'll get in trouble.
Hmm?@0003
You don't want the medicine?@0003
Aww, I'll give you some for
free, if you buy it next time!@0003
[AA]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0160
@0017This town used to belong to Lycia!
But now, look at it...@0003
You guys are out to restore
Ostia's former glory, right?@0003
Then, take this gem...
If you sell it,@0003
it will catch a high price!
Please, help Ostia!@0003
[AB]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0167
@000C@0017Are you going to help Lady Lilina?
Here's something that can cure
injures from a distance!@0003
If Lady Lilina's hurt,
please help her...@0003
[AC]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015F
@000C@0017A while back, some unknown
person was dying in the street.@0003
When I helped him, he gave me
this sword.@0003
Really strange person, but nice...
Hm? Here's the sword.@0003
You can have it!
Just take good care of it.@0003
[AD]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0152@0017Be careful. General Leygance
is allied with Bern now!@0003
He went and slaughtered all those
who resisted him...@0003
But I saved my own hide.
Please take this, it's proof
for Heroes.@0003
Give this to them, and keep
fighting to protect Ostia...@0003
[AE]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015E
Social Knights, Paladins, Nomads...
All those guys riding on horses...@0003
This spear, the Knight Killer,
is effective against them.@0003
There's alot of horsemen in
the rebel army.@0003
So use this against them!@0003
[AF]
@0010@013C@0017You... you beat Bern's
Dragon Knights!?@0003@0002
Ergh...
I'll not let you pass here!@0003

[B0]
@0010@013C@0017General Leygance...
Please be careful...@0003@0002
These people are...@0006
strong...@0003
[B1]
@000C@0010@0102@0014@0017Okay, the city should be
under control by now.@0003
@000C@0080@000DNow we have to recapture
Castle Ostia and rescue Lilina!@0003
@0009@0010@0154Master Roy, we are currently breaking
down the gate to enter the castle.@0003
I understand that you want to get in
quickly, but we are working as fast@0003
as we can, so please be patient!@0003
@000B@0080@000E...Lilina.@0003
@0009@0014Speaking of Lady Lilina...@0003
What do you think of Lord
Hector's story, Master Roy?@0003
@000CYou mean about the Dragons?
They weren't myth,@0003
they were real...@0003
Lord Hector is one of the greatest
battle tacticians in Lycia.@0003
And his army was decimated in such
a short time...@0003
@0009Well, Bern's army is among
the strongest in Elibe.@0003
I say, those Dragon Knights are
indeed very formidable opponents.@0003
@000COf course the Dragon Knights must
have been tough enemies.@0003
But the real Dragons... I can't even
imagine how powerful they must be.@0003
The weapons that are effective
against Dragons...@0003
I wonder where they are?@0003@0080@0004
@0009I presume they must be
the Divine Weapons.@0003
@000CSo if we use those weapons, we
can fight the Dragons effectively.@0003
But I wonder what a Divine Weapon
is doing in Ostia?@0003
@0009Perhaps Lady Lilina knows that.
Hmm, I do wish to know as well.@0003
Oh!@0003
Master Roy, our men have finished
knocking down the gate.@0003
We can enter now!@0003@000C@0080@000DAll right! Charge!
We will rescue Lilina,@0003
no matter what!@0003
[B2]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0144@0017
@0080@000EWhat?!
The enemy has broken into@0003
the castle?@0003
What the hell was Devias
doing out there?!@0003
Were those Knights from Ilia
so strong?@0003
...Or was the Lycia army larger
than I expected...@0003
In any case, they have gotten into
the 'unconquerable' Castle Ostia!@0003@0009@0011
@000CWe must drive them out, or
Bern will look down upon us...@0003
@0002
You over there!@0003
@0009@0010@01D7Yes sir!@0003
@000CSet up the troops all over the castle!@0003
Especially around the throne room!@0003
Prepare your defenses!@0003
We must not let the Lycia Army
get any further into the castle!@0003
@0009Understood sir!@0003
@000C@0080@000DOne more thing.@0003
I want you to discreetly
kill Lilina during the battle.@0003
@0009@0080@000AWhat? ... Sir, weren't we
supposed to keep her alive?@0003
@000BI was planning on using her
as a hostage.@0003
But there are still many rebels
that put faith in her.@0003
If we openly use her as a hostage,
those soldiers might turn against us.@0003
@0008But in that case sir, they would
surely turn on us if we kill her!@0003
@000B@0080@000DSo I said to do it discreetly,
didn't I?!@0003
Kill her quietly, and pretend
that she was hit by a stray arrow.@0003@0002
Then we can make the enemy
responsible for it!@0003
Now go!@0003
@0008Yes, sir...@0003
[B3]
@000C@0010@0102@0005
@0008@0010@011D...General Roy of the Lycia
Alliance Army, I presume.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0017! Who are you?@0005
An enemy?!@0003
@0008@0017No, I'm on your side.
Greetings, my name is Astol.@0003
I used to work here in the
service of Lord Hector.@0003
@000D@0010@0154Excuse me, but what kind of
work were you doing?@0003
You certainly don't look like
one of Ostia's servants...@0003
@0008My, my, aren't we a
little rude, old man?@0003
See, I'm a spy.@0003
I go on secret missions to gather
information, steal things,@0003
check on people...
That kind of thing.@0003
@000DHmm, I see.@0003@0011
@0008If people can tell that I'm working
for a noble just by looking at me,@0003
then I'm not much of a spy, am I?@0003
@0008@0017Anyway, for a month now, I've been
running around Lycia to gather the@0003
latest news.
When I heard about Lord Hector's@0003
death in Araphen, I returned here
as quickly as I could.@0003
Then I see that those idiots,@0003
Leygance and Devias have caused a
rebellion!@0003
I didn't make it in time to save
Lord Hector, but I don't want to be@0003
too late for Lady Lilina.@0003
@000BThen you'll join us?
Good, let's work together to@0003
rescue her.
Do you know where Lilina is?@0003
@0008Of course, investigating into
matters like that is my job.@0003
Lady Lilina is locked into a small
room in the center of the castle.@0003
And that dastard Leygance is sitting
on the throne like he owns the place.@0003
@000BWe have to hurry then.
We must defeat the rebels and@0003
rescue Lilina before Narshen
arrives from Bern!@0003
[B4]
@000C@0010@0122@0014@0017What's all this noise?@0003
Is there a battle going on?@0003
I wonder what's happening outside...@0003
[B5]
@000D@0010@0116@0014@0017Sir Barth,
this is a dead end!@0003
@0009@0010@0108@0014Don't worry.
This wall has cracks in it.@0003
We can break through it if we hit
it a little with our weapons.@0003
@000B@0010@01BDI wonder where
Lady Lilina is?@0003
@0009I have a pretty good idea
where she is.@0003
We've known this castle for
a long time.@0003
Hmm, I do wonder what's
causing all the noise, though.@0003
@000BThe Alliance Army?
Then my brother must be@0003
with them...@0003
@0009... We don't know if he's
still alive.@0003
You shouldn't have such
high expectations.@0003
@000B@0013Oh... Yes.@0003
@000D@0014Sir Barth, you don't
have to be so cold.@0003
He's Wendy's only brother,
right?@0003
@0009@0013You must never look away
from reality.@0003
@000D@0012But...@0003
@000B@0013It's all right, Oujay.
Sir Barth is right.@0003
@0009@0014As an Armor Knight of Ostia,
you must never panic, no@0003
@0005matter what the situation.
Understood, Wendy?@0003
@000B@0012...Yes.@0003
[B6]
@0009@0010@012CYes!
Just as I thought,
they're at each other again.@0003
I mean, how stupid can these
nobles get?@0003
I can never understand what the
fun is in fighting all the time.@0003
Oh well,
guess I'll swipe what I can.@0003
[B7]
@000C@0010@0102@0012Lilina!@0003
@0009@0010@0122...Roy?@0005
Is it really you?@0003
@000CYes!@0003
@0009You came!
Thank you.@0003
@000C@0014Thank goodness you're all right.
Here, take this spell book.@0003
Use it to defend yourself for
the time being.@0003
@0009@0013Thanks.@0003
[B8]
@0009@0010@01BD@0012Bors!@0005
You're all right!@0003
@000C@0010@0109@0013Why, is it Wendy?
I'm glad to see you're okay too.@0003
@0017...!?
What the...@0003
What are you wearing?!
Did you apply to become an Ostian@0003
Armor Knight or something?@0003
@0009@0017Ah... Actually, I did.
I was knighted just yesterday.@0003
@000C@0014@0017What are you doing...
I thought I told you to leave the@0003
fighting to us and live your life
as you wished!@0003
You didn't need to become an
Armor Knight...@0003
@0009@0013@0017Yes, well, I thought about it, and
what I truly want is to become a knight.@0003
@000C@0012@0017But...@0003
@0009@0014I don't want to just wait here
for you to return from battle.@0003
I want to become a knight
as great as you.@0003
@000C@0012@0016......@0003
@0009@0016...Bors?@0003
@000C@0014@0017Well, you were always stubborn,
weren't you, Wendy?@0003
@0009@0012@0017Bors...@0003
@000C@0014@0017You should live your life as you wish.
If Mother and Father were alive,@0003
they would say that as well.
But the way of the knight is no@0003
easy feat!@0003
@0009@0013@0017Yes, I'm prepared!@0005
I shall never give up!@0003
[B9]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0109
Lady Lilina!
You are safe!@0003
@0009Bors, I am
sorry that@0003
I worried you.@0003
@000CNot at all, my Lady!
You were alive...@0003
That in itself...@0003
@0009Thank you, Bors.@0003
And you kept your promise
that you would
protect Roy for me.@0003
I knew I was doing@0003
the right thing
when I asked you.@0003
@000CThank you, my Lady!@0003
[BA]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0108
@0009Barth!@0003
@000CLady Lilina!
I am happy to see you are safe.@0003
@0009@0017Barth, you were right.
Leygance was planning a rebellion.@0003

@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I'm sorry...@0003If I had believed you in the first
place, this wouldn't have happened...@0003
@000CNo...@0003
Lady Lilina, you do not have
anything to apologize about.@0003
The one to be prosecuted is
Leygance, who insulted your kind@0003
and trusting heart toward him.
@0017It is your kindness that@0003
we respect the most, my Lady.@0003
@0009Barth...@0003
[BB]
@0010@0144@0017You vermin of the
Alliance Army... Come.@0003@0006@0002
I shall cut down
all of you!@0003
[BC]
@0010@0144@0017Why? You are only..@0003@0002
to be trampled@0003
upon by Bern...@0003
How can you fight@0003
@0002
so hard...?@0003
[BD]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0102
@000CWe've finally recaptured
the castle, Lilina.@0003
@0009Thank you, Roy.@0003
I'm glad that my father didn't have
to go through the trouble.@0003
@000C@0017!@0003
@0009@0017Roy, is my father still in Araphen?@0003
I heard it was a tough battle there,
but does it looks like it's going to@0003
take much longer?@0003
@000C@0017Lilina...
Haven't you heard anything?@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
@0080@0004@000C@0017Lord Hector...
has passed away.@0003
@0009What...?@0003
@000CI'm sorry... When we arrived
at Castle Araphen...@0003
It was already under Bern's control.@0003
@0009It's not your fault...
Don't apologize.@0003
@000CLord Hector was already severely
wounded when we arrived.@0003
If only we had gotten there faster,
maybe I could have helped him...@0003
@0009@0017No... it's okay.
I... was prepared for this...@0003
I'm a warrior's daughter.@0003
I've been taught not to panic
in times like this.@0003
@000C@0017Lilina.@0003
@0009So everyone should have told me...
They're too considerate...@0003
I'm strong too, you know...@0003
@000CLilina, you don't have to
hold back in front of me.@0003
@0009Roy... I...@0003
@000CIt's okay...
I'll be with you.@0003
[BE]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102@0009@0014@0017Master Roy! Bern's Dragon Knights
have appeared at Castle Ostia!@0003
@000C@0080@000DWhat!
They're here already?@0003
[BF]
@0008@0010@0142@000D@0010@0102@0008@0016Hehehe...
@0016Are you Roy?@0003
I must thank you for getting
rid of that idiot Leygance for me.@0003
@0008@0080@000BNow, you will leave Ostia
to me.@0003
@000D@0080@000D@0017Don't be ridiculous!
Who would give Ostia to the likes@0003
of you..!@0003
@0009@0017Oh?@0003
Then do you wish to fight us
with that sad little group of yours?@0003
@0009@0080@000CI shall annihilate you,
as I did with Hector!@0003
@000B@0012@0017Damn!@0003
@000FThat's enough!@0003
[C0]
@0009@0010@0142@0005
@000B@0010@01D7@0014@0017General Narshen!
A legion has arrived from Etruria!@0003
@000B@0011@0009I can see that, you fool!
Why...@0003
@000C@0010@011A@0013I am Percival,
Knight General of Etruria.@0003
@0014Yesterday, Sorcery General Cecilia
informed me that Ostia had@0003
requested Etruria's protection.@0003
@0009@0012What...!@0003@001C
@000C@0011@000C@0010@0134@0014@0017You seem discontent.
We are prepared for battle.@0003
But can those Dragon Knights of yours
stand a chance against all of us?@0003
@0009@0017You...!@0003
@000CI am Cecilia,
Sorcery General of Etruria!@0003
Ostia is now under our
protection.@0003
@0009@0080@000CArgh...
You...you...!!!@0003
@0008@0010@01D7@0014General Narshen,
please control your temper!@0003
General Percival is one of the
strongest warriors in Etruria!@0003
And with General Cecilia here as well
we'll be slaughtered!@0003
@000AI know!
We're leaving!@0003
@0008@0011@000A@0080@000ACecilia, is it?
Watch your back from now on!@0003
[C1]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Are you General Roy of the
Lycia Alliance Army?@0003
@000CY-Yes!@0003
I am in charge of the Alliance Army
in the place of Lord Hector.@0003
@0009I see.
Lycia is in a time of hardship.@0003
Our king also sends his words of
regret for Lord Hector's death.@0003
@000CThank you for your consideration.@0003
If Etruria hadn't helped us...
Ostia would be under Bern's control now.@0003
Thank you very much.@0003
@0009I am not the one to thank.
I simply followed my king's orders.@0003
You should thank Cecilia, who
went against the king to help you.@0003
@000CShe...
disobeyed the king's orders?@0003
@0009Yes,
now isn't that something?@0003
Well, I must be off.@0003
Two of the three Etrurian Generals
shouldn't be leaving the country@0003
for so long.@0003
Cecilia,@000C@0011@000C@0010@0134
@0009can you take care of the rest?@0003
@000CYes. Thank you, Percival.@0003
You can leave the rest to me.@0003
[C2]
@000C@0010@0102@0017Whew...
General Percival...@0003
Now he's someone.@0003
@0009@0010@0134@0017Nervous, were you?@0003
@000CGeneral Cecilia!
It is good to see you again.@0003
@0009How are you doing, Roy?
You look a little tired,@0003
but you seem okay.@0003
@000CYes, thanks to Etruria,
we were able to avoid disaster.@0003
@0009I'm glad we made it
here in time.@0003
@000C@0014@0017I'm sorry.@0003
I put you through a lot of
trouble.@0003
@0009No.@0003
It's going to be beneficial for Etruria
for Ostia to go under our protection.@0003
@000CBeneficial?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
Bern's been acting aggressively
these days, as you know.@0003
We also want to do something about it,
but since we haven't been directly@0003
invaded, we have no reason to go to@0003
war with them.@0003
But if Bern gets any stronger, the
balance of powers would be shattered.@0003
@000CSo when Ostia requested@0003
protection, you saw it as a good
reason to declare war on Bern?@0003
@0009Right.@0003
@0009We just did what would be
best for us.@0003
You don't need to feel that
you're in our debt.@0003
@000C@0013Yes.@0003
@0009@0017So you shouldn't thank us.@0003
@000CUnderstood. I won't.@0003
Well anyway, please come in and
meet the rest of our army.@0003
[C3]
@0009@0010@0134... He's gotten so bold in the short
time that I haven't seen him.@0003
Well, he is a boy, after all.@0003
[C4]
@0010@0108@0017Show the enemy the
power of us Armor Knights!@0003
Triangle Attack!!@0003
[C5]
@0010@0109@0017Get ready!@0006
Charge!@0003
Triangle Attack!!@0003
[C6]
@0010@01BD@0017Uh...
Let's go!@0003
Triangle Attack!!@0003
[C7]
@0009@0010@0151@000C@0010@013E
@0009@0017Boss! Those guys from
Lycia, they're here.@0003
@000C@0013You sure?@0003
@0009@0014Yup. We just saw 'em arrive on
the small island to the east.@0003
@000C@0014Just as that other group said...@0003
All right, they're probably
floundering around in the fog@0003
unable to see anything.
Just sneak up on them@0003
from behind and kill 'em off.@0003
@0009@0012Sure thing, boss.@0003
[C8]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0134
@0009@0017Roy, I'm sorry that
I couldn't be of help.@0003
@000CPlease don't worry about it.
It isn't your responsibility,@0003
Lady Cecilia.@0003
@0009Yes. But even within Etruria,
there are a lot of people voicing their@0003
discontent on how the advisor is
treating Lycia like servants.@0003
@000CAdvisor? I thought the
king had made the decision to send Lycia@0003
to clear out the bandits.@0003
@0009No. Advisor Roartz had been working with@0003
Lord Arcard, who's in charge
of the mining operation in the@0003
Western Isles, and they decided to
do it on their own without@0003
consulting the king.@0003
@000CHow can they do that?@0003
@0009...Do you remember last year's
tragedy in Etruria?@0003
@000COf course.
Etruria's next heir,@0003
Prince Mildain,
suddenly passed away last year.@0003
@0009Right.@0003
@000CI never had the honor to meet him.@0003
I understand that he was a very
bright individual.@0003
@0009Yes... If the prince were alive,
Etruria wouldn't be like this.@0003
King Mordred couldn't bear the fact
that his son had died.@0003
The shock was so great that he never
completely recovered from it.@0003
And today, it seems like he's always
in a different world, and he doesn't@0003
really pay attention to anything going
on around him or in his country.@0003
Roartz took advantage of this.@0003@0002
Now, he's basically in charge
of what goes in the palace.@0003
Ever since then, he has kept the
Three Etrurian Generals,@0003
Lord Douglas, Percival, and me,
away from the king unless there's@0003
a great emergency.@0003

@000C@0010@013E
@0009@0010@0113@0012@0017Sir Scott!@0003
@000C@0013@0017Oh, it's Fir.
Sorry I had to call you in.@0003
@0009@0014@0017What is all this noise about?@0003
@000CWell you see, some brigands
are attacking this island.@0003
The people living here are in danger.@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0013What!@0003
@000C@0014I sent some guys over to try and stop
them, but the invaders are pretty tough.@0003
The situation doesn't look good.@0003
@000A@0012I can't believe...@0003
@000C@0014If only I could go out there...
but I can't leave the castle.@0003
So, Fir, I'm sorry,
but...@0003
@000A@0014Yes. I shall go
and drive them off.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Thanks.@0003
@000A@0013@0017Leave it to me!
Attacking innocent villagers...@0003
that's not forgivable!@0003
@000C@0013I asked another guy too,
so you can work with him.@0003
@000A@0012Someone else?@0003
@000C@0014Yeah, a nomad named Shin.@0005
He looks frail, but he's got@0003
a decent shot with his bow.@0003
[CC]
@000C@0010@013E
@0009@0010@0151@0017Boss, you sure? I mean,
letting a girl like that fight@0003
out there...@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I know what I'm doing.
Once she's killed, we can@0003
get that sword she's carrying.@0003
@0009@0017Sword?
That weird one she has?@0003
@000C@0017That's no ordinary sword.
That's the 'Wo Dao', a famous katana.@0003
If we can get it from her and sell it,
it'll be worth a fortune. Hehe...@0003
@0009I see.
@0014So that's why you were so@0003
generous to her at first.@0003
@000CI couldn't make a move up until
now, but now's a chance.@0003
Listen, I want you to follow her.
When you see the chance, grab@0003
the sword from her!@0003
@0009@0012Sure thing, boss!@0003
[CD]
@000C@0010@0105@0009@0010@0113@0012@0017Are you...
Shin?@0003
@000C@0013That's me.
I heard the story from Scott.@0003
Let's go.@0003
@0009@0012@0016.....@0003
@000C@0012......@0003
@0009@0012@0016Um...@0003
@000C@0012What?@0003
@0009@0014Um, did you also @0017join the fight
to protect the people living here?@0003
@000C@0017No... I have no such
interest in such things.@0003
@0009@0013Then why?@0003
@000C@0014I'm paid to fight.@0005
That's all.@0003
@0009@0012@0016.....@0003
@000C@0012.....@0016@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0013...I gotta keep the 
conversation going.@0003
@0002
@000C@0010@0105@0009@0017Um... you're from Sacae,
right?@0003
@000C@0012@0017Right.@0003
@0009@0013@0017What took you all
the way out here?@0003
@000C@0013@0017It's nothing new. You look like
you're from Sacae, and you're also here.@0003
@0009@0014@0017Well I'm traveling around Elibe
to train myself, and...@0003
Oh, you weren't asking about me,
were you...@0003
@000C@0012@0017@0016......@0003
@0009@0012@0016...Whew.@0003
@000C@0014...I'm looking for somebody.@0003
@0009@0014Who?@0003
@000C...My clan lost to Bern
when they invaded Sacae.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000COur clan leader let me escape,
and he told me@0003
to find and protect
his granddaughter.@0003
So I left the battlefield
to fulfill his request.@0003
@0009I see...
Well, I hope you find her.@0003
@000C...Yes.@0003
[CE]
@0009@0010@0113@000C@0010@0130
@000C@0014Fir!
It is you!@0003
@0009@0013Sir Noah?!
What are you doing here?!@0003
@000C@0014Yes, I joined this army
a while back... Whoa!@0003@0011
@000C@0010@0130@0017What are you thinking?!
Put away your sword!@0003
@0009Sir Noah! I thought you were
nobler than this!@0003
@000C@0012What?@0003
@0009@0014Just because you're
a mercenary knight...@0003
Lending your services to pirates?!
You should be ashamed!@0003
@000C@0012...Huh?@0003
@0009@0014Don't play dumb!
You're working with a band of@0003
pirates to attack the people
living on this island!@0003
And you call yourself a knight?!@0003
@000C@0017Um, can I have a sec? I think
there's a really big misunderstanding...@0003
@0009@0017Misunderstanding?!
You still insist...@0003
@000C@0017We're trying to help
the villagers.@0003
We're supposed to go defeat
the head of a pirate group.@0003
I think his name was Scott
or something.@0003
@0009@0017What? Scott is the head
of a pirate band?@0003
@000C@0017If you think I'm lying, why don't
you ask the pirate over there?@0003
He's right behind you,
hiding in the bushes.@0003
@0009@0017Pirate?
What pirate...@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0011@000C@0010@0113@0009@0010@0151
@0009@0014Damn! I better
go tell the boss!@0003@0011
@000C@0012Hey!
Wait!@0003@0011
@0009@0010@0113@000C@0010@0130@000C@0017...You didn't suspect at
all?@0003
@0009No! Scott was very
kind to me...@0003
@000CReally? Rumors say that
he's a very cruel man...@0003
@0009@0017Well, my mother used to say that you
shouldn't judge people by their looks...@0003
@000C@0017Well, that's true,
but...@0003
@0009@0017...I was lending my services
to pirates...@0003
What can I do now?@0003
@000C@0017Then you want to come
along with us?@0003
@0009@0013What?
Would it be okay?@0003
@000C@0014We're always looking for more
people to strengthen our army.@0003
I'll talk to Roy about it.@0003
@0009@0013Thank you!@0003

[CF]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0105
@000C@0012Lady Sue!@0003
@0009@0013@0017Shin...
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0014@0017I was looking for you.@0003
@0009@0012@0017For me?@0003
@000C@0017Yes.
That was the clan leader's orders.@0003
@0009@0013@0017...What happened to
our clan after I left?@0003
@000CI'm sorry, we didn't stand
a chance against Bern...@0003
@0009@0012...We lost.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009@0013What has happened to
my grandfather?@0003
@000C@0014He is continuing the
struggle against Bern...@0003
@0009@0012I see...@0003
@000C@0012I was told by the clan leader
to leave and look for you.@0003
@0009@0013Then will you fight
alongside us?@0003
@000CWith you?@0003
@0009@0014We will be helping Grandfather because
this army is fighting against Bern.@0003
Also, this army saved my life
earlier.@0003
@000C@0013Understood, my lady.
If that is your plan,@0003
then I am at your disposal.@0003
@0009@0017Thank you.@0003
[D0]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0187
@0017 This area basically belongs
to the pirates.@0003
They just steal from us
all the time.@0003
Resistance?
That's useless.@0003
They can do whatever they want
because they have lots of support.@0003
We can't fight against
them like the resistance force.@0003
[D1]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018A
@0002You saved us!@0003
Are you with the Registrants?
No?@0003
Then you're just normal good people?
Just as you've seen, this island@0003
is swarmed with pirates and bandits!@0003
But... what are we going to do?@0003
Rumors around here say there's a severe
battle going on in the west.@0003
Go ahead and tell them that
we're leaving the island...@0003
[D2]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0185
@0017Eh...@0003
The only people here are the
women and children.@0003
Everyone else, the workers,
have gone north to the mines.@0003
They aren't even allowed to sleep there,
they just work until they die...@0003
My brother, who escaped,
is as thin as an old man.@0003
That day, he drew his last breath.@0003
Now that I've told you this...
Can you do... er, sorry...@0003
I've said too much.
Please forget all of this.@0003
We're leaving this island now.@0003
[D3]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015C
Geez, there's so much mist here...@0003
In these conditions, you have NO idea,
if anyone is lurking around!@0003
The Torch Staff is useful, even for
those hard-eyed thieves.@0003
[D4]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0188
The resistance is doing quite well.@0003
In the north, and in the east--
they're always in the thick@0003
of battle.
Which way will you go?@0003
[D5]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0186
Among the pirates is a very
skilled nomad...@0003
Even though you can't see him
at all in the mist...@0003
They're horse-riding people,
but this guy also has a girl@0003
with him...@0003
[D6]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0188
The nearby villages...
Everyone in them are leaving@0003
the islands.
It's very sad, really.@0003
If you want to visit, you'd
better do it quickly.@0003
You don't have time to go to both,
so you'll have to decide.@0003
[D7]
@0010@013E@0017So the fog didn't
@0017stop you after all...@0003
But you gotta be pretty@0003
beat up by now!
I'll finish you off!@0003
[D8]
@0010@013E@0017Who the hell...
are you?@0003
You're no ordinary army..@0003
[D9]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Merlinus, it looked like the
enemy was trying to ambush us...@0003
@0009They must have known
we were coming.@0003
@000C@0013Something must be going on
behind the scenes...@0003
@0009Yes. Clearing out the bandits
might be harder than we had@0003
expected.
Ever since Bern started@0003
their invasion, something is
different with Elibe.@0003
@000CI wonder what's going to 
happen from now...@0003
Dragons reappearing, Bern's sudden
invasion, the collapse of@0003
the Lycia Alliance...@0003
All of these strange things
happening at once.@0003
Still, we have to take things one
at a time however tedious it@0003
may seem.@0003

[DA]
@0009@0013@0017Now...
What do we do?@0003
@000C@0014How about moving north
along the coast?@0003
@0009North...
Towards the mines?@0003
@000CRight. I've heard that the people
living on the islands are being@0003
forced into labor over there.@0003
@0009So we must
rescue them first.@0003
@000CYes. Then we might be able to
find out who's behind all this.@0003
@0009Well, we must start
somewhere.@0003
@000CAll right...
Let's head north.@0003

[DB]
@0009@0013@0017Now... where do we go
from here?@0003
@000C@0014Let's head west.@0003
@0009West?@0003
@000CI've heard there's a rebel
group based there.@0003
They're fighting the bandits
to protect the villagers.@0003
@0009I see. So we can visit them and
gather some information on what's@0003
going on these islands.@0003
@000CRight. If we just go searching
blindly, we won't get anywhere.@0003
@0009I have no objections,
Master Roy.@0003
@000CAll right,
then let's head west.@0003

[DC]
@0009@0014@0017Now... where do we go from here?
We must choose.@0003
@000C@0013Do you have an idea?@0003
@0009@0014If we follow the coast up
north, we should reach the@0003
largest mine on the isles.
Perhaps the bandits gather there.@0003
@000CAh, I see.@0003
@0009Our task is to get rid of
all of the bandits.@0003
We shouldn't be wandering
around aimlessly.@0003
@000C@0013You're right.
Let's head north!@0003
[DD]
@000C@0010@01E4@0017How is that spy from the
resistance force doing?@0003
@0008@0010@01D7Do you mean that dancer called
Lalum, or something?@0003
We threw her in the
dungeon, sir.@0003
@000C@0013Well,
did she admit anything?@0003
@0008@0014No, she just keeps repeating that
it is some kind of mistake and@0003
that she has nothing to do with
the resistance force.@0003@0011
@000C@0017Hmph, she thinks she can get
away with that, does she?@0003
I should go ask
her myself...@0003
@0009@0010@01D7@0013@0017Lord Nord!@0003
@000C@0012What?@0003
@0009@0014There is a messenger here
sent by the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0012Ah, it's the army that was sent to
clean up the bandits on these isles..@0003
@0009@0014It seems that they want permission
to pass through to Mt. Ebrakhm.@0003
@000B...Lord Arcard did say to get rid
@0017of the Lycia Alliance Army while@0003
they were still here... Hehehe...
This is a great chance to show off@0003
to Lord Arcard and get a share
of his riches.@0003
@0017Send out some troops
and kill them off!@0003
@0009Yes sir..@0003@0002
What about the messenger?@0003
@000BKill him.@0003
@0009@0012Understood sir.@0003
@000BAlso, don't forget to bring
out the ballistae.@0003
Those are some nice weapons that
can attack from afar, so use@0003
them to confuse the Alliance army!@0003
@0009@0013Yes sir.@0003
@000B@0014And make sure the enemy
doesn't get ahold of them!@0003
[DE]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Master Roy, soldiers are
coming out of the castle.@0003
@000C@0013Are there some
bandits around here?@0003
@0009@0014No, they seem
to be after us.@0003
@000C... What about the messenger?@0003
@0009He hasn't returned yet...
That means...@0003
@000CWhat's that supposed to mean?@0003
Why is Nord attacking us?@0003
@0009The enemy is advancing...
Master Roy, what should we do?@0003
@000C...I guess we'll have to fight.@0003
Anyway, we need to get to the castle.
Then we might learn something.@0003
@0009Yes.
I suppose so.@0003
@000CAll right, we're going
to storm the castle!@0003
But don't kill more than
you have to!@0003
[DF]
@000C@0010@01E4@0017Gonzales!
Where's Gonzales?!@0003
@0009@0010@012F@0013Here... I here...@0003
@000C@0014There's a village to the north,
right along the mountain.@0003
You understand?@0003
@0009@0012Understand.@0003
@000C@0014That might be a hidden base for
the resistance forces.@0003
I want you to go there and
destroy it, village and all.@0003
@0009@0012Village and all...@0003
@000C@0013Right. Now go!@0003
A stupid brute like you only
comes in use at times like this.@0003
Now get moving.@0003
@0009@0012I... I...@0003
@000C@0014Do you have a problem?@0003
@0009@0012N-No...@0003@0011
@000C@0014Hmph, he looks like hell but he's
cursed to have such a kind heart.@0003
He must learn that crushing a single
village is nothing!@0003
[E0]

[E1]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@0184
@000C@0017So Geese...
You're really leaving?@0003
@0009Yeah.@0003
My friends were killed
by the owner of that castle.@0003
I gotta avenge them.@0003
@000CThose guys that always
were with you...@0003
@0009Yeah... When I wasn't around, they
were taken to the mines, and told@0003
that they would be given work.@0003
But they worked like slaves
until they...died.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Maybe they weren't that smart,
but they were good guys...@0003
And somebody just killed them off...
just like that...!!@0003
@000CSo you're going to
avenge them on your own?@0003
@0009Is there something wrong
with that?@0003
@000CNo...
But you're not going back@0003
to being a sea merchant?@0003
@0009Well...
Once I avenge my friends@0003
and once the war resides,
I'll think about it.@0003
@000C@0017... We won't forget you.
You guys always risked your own@0003
lives to bring and sell food
and supplies to us.@0003
If you need anything,
just come to us.@0003
@0009Yeah, if I'm still alive.
... Thanks.@0003
[E2]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Are you working
for Etruria?!@0003
@000C@0013Y-Yes...@0003
@0009@0014We are warriors fighting for
the freedom of the people@0003
suffering from your tyranny!
Die!@0003
@000C@0013W-Wait!
We aren't your enemy!@0003
@0009@0014What? Aren't you siding with
the residents of that castle?@0003
@000CNo.@0003
We're fighting to capture
the castle.@0003
@0009Oh!
So it was my mistake.@0003
@000CI am Roy, leader of
the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@0009Lycia?
You've come a long way...@0003
@000CWe were sent here by
Etruria to rid these isles@0003
of the bandits.@0003
@0009!?
So you are with Etruria!@0003
@000CPlease calm yourself!
Our goal is the same as yours.@0003
We want to help the people living
here so they can lead their lives@0003
peacefully.@0003
@0009... You might end up fighting
against the Etrurian nobility.@0003
@000C... Our mission is to find and
eliminate those who are doing evil.@0003
It doesn't matter what
their social status is.@0003
@0009@0013Such strong will!
I like that in a man!@0003
All right, I shall fight
alongside you as well!@0003
@000C@0013You would help us?
Thank you!@0003
[E3]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@0113
@000C@0013@0017Father?
What are you doing here?@0003
@0009@0017Ah, Fir!
I was looking for you.@0003
@000C@0014@0017Father,
I have made up my mind.@0003
I want to become a great
swordfighter like Mother...@0003
@0009@0017I understand.@0003
I don't mean to drag you home.@0003
In fact, I want to assist you
in your journey.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Assist me?@0003
@0009@0014Well, I know that there are a lot of
hardships during a journey of training.@0003
So I can help you out
in tough situations...@0003
@000CBut Father, if you kept helping me,
there would be no point to my training.@0003
@0009@0012Nonsense.@0003
@0014Would you not be able to train your
sword skills with your father around?@0003
Or do you not understand your Father's
love for worrying about you like this?@0003
@000C@0013No!
That's not it...@0003
@0009@0017Well then,
we understand each other.@0003
But first we must capture
that castle.@0003
@0011@000C@0012@0017Sigh....@0003
@0014I have to tell Roy that we're
getting another member...@0003
[E4]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0122
@000C@0012@0017Excuse me!@0003
@0009@0013W-What are you!
I'm an enemy!@0003
@000C@0014I'm sorry...
But you had such a sad look@0003
in your eyes.@0003
@0009...There is village near
mountain. You know?@0003
@000C@0013Yes, I know.@0003
@0009Let the people escape.@0003
I take order,
I destroy village.@0003
So...@0003
@000C@0014What? Don't!
The people living in the@0003
village are innocent...@0003
@0009@0013No.
I can't disobey order.@0003
@000C@0014Can't you leave the people
who give you orders like that?@0003
@0009Leave?@0003
@000C@0014@0017I know!
You should fight alongside us.@0003
We're protecting the villagers.@0003
@0009@0017...No...
I'm a monster...@0003
I can't be with other people...
People throw stones...@0003
They say 'go away' to me...
I'm a monster...@0003
Not human...@0003
@000CNo!
Of course you're a human!@0003
You're also a kind-hearted human.@0003
I can tell.
Come with us.@0003
Don't be afraid.@0003
@0009@0013@0017Me afraid
[E5]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Hm? What?
You got something to say to me?@0003
@000CNo, I was just wondering why
you're going up against the@0003
castle's soldiers on your own.@0003
@0009Who are you?@0003
@000CI'm Roy, leader of the Lycia
Alliance Army.@0003
We're here due to a
request from Etruria...@0003
@0009You're with Etruria?!
Then you're not on my side.@0003
Die!@0003
@000CWait, wait!
We're also fighting the@0003
castle's troops.@0003
@0009What?
What do you mean?@0003
@000CI don't know either.
We were sent here by Etruria to@0003
rid the islands of the bandits,
but...@0003
@0009...You said that you're fighting
the castle's troops.@0003
Then you wanna hire me?@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009@0017I'm a pirate, so I'm pretty familiar
with the lands around here.@0003
You look like you've never been
here before, so you could use a@0003
guide, couldn't you?@0003
@000C@0017That would help,
but why?@0003
@0009I want to help you with
your mission.@0003
@0017Well, I'm a pirate, so I'm
probably part of the "bandits"@0003
that you're talking about, but
I generally only go after rich@0003
people who have more than they
need anyway.@0003
@000CAll right,
then I'll ask you to help us.@0003
We don't know this area very well,
so we were having trouble.@0003
@0009Great!
Leave it to me!@0003
@000C@0011@0006
@0009@0017... This is it, guys.
I'll avenge you with all of@0003
my strength!@0003
After that, I guess I can tag
along with that Roy guy...@0003
[E6]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0184
@0017I'm worried --
Is Lalum all right?@0003
For our sake she brought us weapons
from all over the place.@0003
Even when we begged her to hide,
she still continued to help us.@0003@0002
Here's an axe that she brought us.
It's a pretty strange one...@0003
It's strong against swords,
but weak against spears!@0003
But instead of this, I'd
rather see her dance again...@0003
[E7]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0188
@0017The bandits and pirates...@0003
You know, when they're born,
they're so cute.@0003
Maybe if I spoke to them,
I'd have an understanding.@0003
[E8]
@0010@01E4So you made it here.@0003@0002
I shall take your
lives...@0003
[E9]
@0010@01E4@0017...Death?@0003@0002
I feel... my life..
draining.. away...@0003
[EA]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Master Roy...@0003
We couldn't find out why Nord
attacked us in the end.@0003
@000CBut now there's no mistake
that there's somebody after us.@0003
@0009Hm, I think we should contact
Etruria about this.@0003
@000CYes. I'll talk to
General Cecilia about this.@0003@0009@0011
@0008@0010@0152Excuse me, Master Roy.@0003
There's a girl whom we found
captured in the dungeon.@0003
She wishes to speak with you.@0003
@000CTo me?
Let her pass.@0003
@0008@0012Yes sir.@0003@0011
@0009@0010@0126@0014@001CYou are Master Roy?
The one who's here to clear@0003
out the bandits?@001C@0003
@000C@0013Yes.@0003
@0009@0080@000D@001C@0014Roy, please!
Please rescue my friends!@0003@001C
@000C@0080@000FWow!@0003
@0008@0010@0154@0080@000C@0014Hey!
Get off of him!@0003
@000DA-Anyway let's calm down
and talk.@0003
Your friends are in danger?@0003@000A@0011
@000B@0080@000BMy name is Lalum.@0003
I'm part of the resistance forces
on this island.@0003
@000D@0013The one that fights the bandits
and protects the people living here?@0003
@0009@0012Yes.@0005
...No!@0003
@000DNo?@0003
@0009Of course that's part of our job,
but our real enemy is Etruria!@0003
They are working with the bandits
to take more money and resources@0003
from people!@0003
@000D@0080@000EWhat!
Is that true!?@0003
@0009The marquesses and warlords living here
are taking people into the mine @0003
and work them until they die!!@0003
They never let them rest,
even if they're sick or injured.@0003
@000C... Horrible...@0003
@0009@0014@0016So we're fighting the Etrurian
government to protest against them!@0003
Our next plan was to attack the mine
at Mt. Ebrakhm and rescue the@0003
people there!@0003
@000C@0013What's the matter!
Calm down.@0003
@0009A villager here leaked the
information on our plan!@0003
He was probably tortured,
but I didn't think he would@0003
tell...@0003
@0009@0014@001CI have to go to the mines
before everyone's captured!@001C@0003
@000CAll right, then let's go!@0003
We have to rescue the resistance forces
and people being forced into labor!@0003
@001C@0009@0080@000D@0013@0017Really!?
Thank you, Roy!@0003@001C
@000C@0080@000F@0014@0017Whoa!
M-Miss Lalum!@0003
@0008@0010@0154@0080@000CHey!
I said get off of him!@0003@0011@001C
@000B@0080@000B@0017Here, Roy.
Use this sword.@0003
@000D@0080@000E@0017What is this?@0003
@0009@0017It belongs to our leader, Echidna.
Because you're helping us,@0003
I don't think she'll get mad@0003
even if you use it.@0003
It's called the "Dragon Killer", but
there aren't any Dragons anymore.@0003
Maybe they're useful against
Dragon Knights?@0003
Well I don't really know.@0005
But it should come to be@0003
handy sometime.@0003
[EB]
@0009@0010@0140@000C@0010@012E
@000C@0013@0017I see...@0003
@0014So Princess Guinevere is nowhere
on the Western Isles?@0003
@0009We searched all over these islands,@0003
and we sent spies in to the
Lycia Alliance Army, but we could@0003
not find the princess anywhere.
I'm sorry.@0003
@000CI understand.
I suppose I will search elsewhere.@0003
Bishop Oro, I thank you for your
cooperation with Bern.@0003
@0009@0017I will pray that you will be able
to meet with Princess Guinevere soon.@0003
@000CThank you.@0003@0011
[EC]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0140
@0009@0013Bishop Oro,
who was that?@0003
@000C@0014A Dragon Knight from Bern.
Her name is Miledy.@0003
She was looking for Princess
Guinevere, who is her mistress.@0003
@0009Did you tell her where
the princess is?@0003
@000COf course not.
Princess Guinevere is a valuable hostage.@0003
When Advisor Roartz heard news that
Cecilia was hiding with Guinevere in@0003
Aquleia, he was as excited as the
time when he was reported the@0003
assassination of Prince Mildain
had been successful.@0003
@0009Bishop Oro!
You mustn't say he@0003
was assassinated...@0003
@000COh, I must watch my tongue.
Anyway, Guinevere has much value.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
@000CAnd now,
why did you come before me?@0003
Did you not have something
to say?@0003
@0009Yes, my lord.@0003
It is about the village where
the resistance leader is hiding.@0003
We are now prepared to launch an
attack on the village, so I came@0003
to report.@0003
@000CAll right, well done.@0003
Then start your attack immediately,
before we have any unwanted@0003
interruptions..@0003
[ED]
@0009@0010@0126@000B@0010@0102@0017So the resistance hideout is in
one of these villages here?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
But it's possible that the landlord's
troops have attacked it already.@0003
@000D@0010@0154I must say, that Oro is a
despicable man.@0003
A bishop should be preaching
the words of God to help the@0003
people.
But in fact he is torturing@0003
his people!
That is far from forgivable!@0003
@001C
@000BWe should probably wait for
General Cecilia's reply, but...@0003@001C@0009@0011
@0008@0010@0152@0014Master Roy!@0003
Troops from the castle are
attacking the villages!@0003@0011
@000DWhat!
Master Roy, should we attack?@0003
@000B@0014I guess we can't wait for her
reply then... But I want to@0003
help the people here.@0003
Even if it means that we'll be on
bad terms with Etruria...@0003
@000D@0011
@0009@0010@0126Roy..@0003
@000BLet's fight!!@0003
So we can be proud of our actions
when we return to Lycia!@0003
[EE]
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@0136
@000C@0017Miledy, did you find out
where Princess Guinevere is?@0003
@0009No...@0003
It looks like she left the
Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
Just when I thought I had
found her...@0003
@000CSo it's no use looking,
then.@0003
@0009@0014Gale...
I'm sorry.@0003
King Zephiel wanted to keep the
case on Princess Guinevere in@0003
secrecy, so he only assigned
my group to look for her.@0003
I'm sorry I got you mixed
up into this...@0003
@000CYou shouldn't worry yourself
over things like that.@0003
@0009But you're one of the captains working
directly under General Murdock.@0003
@000CGeneral Murdock has agreed to
my helping you out.@0003
Anyway, Princess Guinevere must
still be on the mainland.@0003
Well then, I guess we'll ask
General Narshen for some more@0003
help.@0003
@0009@0013You're going to bow to
General Narshen?@0003
@000C@0014Hm?
Of course.@0003
He's one of the Three Dragon Lords,
and he's in charge of the armies@0003
attacking Lycia and Etruria.@0003
@0009@0013Gale,
aren't you... mad?@0003
@000C@0012About what?@0003
@0009@0014I mean...@0003
Skill wise, you should be one of
the Three Dragon Lords.@0003
But Narshen accused you of not being
a native of Bern, and he snatched@0003
the position away from you.@0003
And you're going to bow down to
him and ask him for help?@0003
@000C@0013Well, what he said was true...
I wasn't born in Bern.@0003
@0009@0012But...@0003
@000C@0014I'm happy with the position I
have now.@0003
And King Zephiel and General
Murdock put trust in me, even@0003
if I'm not a native of Bern.
What more could I ask?@0003
@0009@0012Gale...@0003
[EF]
@0009@0010@01D7@0017Echidna!
We have surrounded this entire area!@0003
We know you are hiding in there!@0003
Drop your weapons and come out
at once!@0003@0006
[F0]
@000C@0010@0133@0012@0017@0016......@0003
@0009@0010@01D7@0016You are Echidna,
leader of the resistance forces?@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@0189@0014Miss Echidna, I'm sorry!
They took my family hostage...@0003
@000CI understand.
Leave this to me.@0003
Hurry home to your family now.@0003
@0008@0012Sorry...
Really.@0003@0011
@0009@0010@01D7@0014If you surrender peacefully,
perhaps Bishop Oro will have@0003
mercy on you.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Sorry, but I'm sorta
the stubborn type.@0003
@0009You'll resist?
Then we have no choice!@0003@0002
Kill her!@0003
[F1]
@000C@0010@0140Hahaha...
I've got an idea... Somebody!@0003
@0009@0010@01D7@0013@0017Yes, my lord?@0003
@000C@0014Tell the bandits that the
villages are in a confused state.@0003
I want them to ransack the villages
and collect all the money and@0003
treasure.@0003
@0009@0013Yes.
But.. are you sure?@0003
If this becomes public...@0003
@000C@0014You forget I speak for God himself.@0003
If anyone tries to accuse me
it would be going against God!@0003
Therefore, no one on this island
can prosecute me!@0003
Anyway, hurry. It won't be any use
if the crisis in the villages@0003
slow down.@0003
@0009@0012Yes.@0003
[F2]
@000C@0010@0151So you're sure we can raid the
villages as much as we want?@0003
@0009@0010@01D7@0017Yes.
But in return...@0003
@000C@0017Yeah yeah, we're supposed to take
half the loot to the castle, right?@0003
That's one hell of a Bishop you
guys got there.@0003
@0009@0013@0017Thank you for your
cooperation.@0003@0011
@000C@0014@0017All right, boys!
Loot the villages!@0003
Grab all the treasure!@0003
[F3]
@0009@0010@0152@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Master Roy, bandits are approaching
from the mountains to the east.@0003
@000CThey're thinking of attacking the
villages during the confusion...@0003
We have to stop them and rescue
the people!@0003
[F4]
@0009@0010@0140@000C@0010@01D7
@0009@0017What is taking so long?!@0003
Are the resistance forces
that much of a problem?!@0003
@000CThe Lycia Alliance Army!@0003
They are supporting the
resistance force...@0003
@0009What!@0003
The Lycia Alliance would turn
against Etruria?@0003
@000CWe have just received a message
from the capital of Djuto!@0003
It says...@0003
"The Lycia Alliance Army is responsible
for the murder of Marquess Nord.@0003
They are suspected for turning
against Etruria.@0003
There is also the possibility they
are tied in with the bandits.@0003
Capture them, or kill them if
necessary.@0003
@0009So they killed Marquess Nord...@0003
@0017Anyway, they've come up with a
good excuse to get rid of the@0003
Lycia Alliance Army.
Hahaha... tied in with the@0003
bandits, eh?
How ironic...@0003
@000C@0017Lord Arcard has provided some
reinforcements to help us capture@0003
the Lycia Alliance Army.
They should be here shortly.@0003
@0009@0017How generous!
He said 'capture them', but he
probably plans on killing them@0003
anyway.@0003
So let's do the job for him.
Kill them all!@0003
@000C@0017Yes, my lord!@0003
[F5]
@0009@0010@0140@000C@0010@01D7@000CBishop Oro,
additional reinforcements will@0003
be arriving shortly.@0003
@0009Well...
I hope this will be enough.@0003
They are fighting better
than I expected...@0003
[F6]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@0126
@000C@0013Echidna!@0003
@0009@0014Lalum?
You were all right?@0003
Good.. If something happened to
you, I wouldn't know what to@0003
say to Elphin.@0003
@000C@0017I'm sorry... If I hadn't been
caught, I could have told you earlier..@0003
@0009@0017It's okay.
Don't worry.@0003
@000C@0017But...@0003
@0009@0017Don't cry over spilled milk.
That's not like you.@0003
And besides,
I'm all in one piece.@0003
That's good news, no?@0003
@000C@0012@0017... Yeah.@0003
So anyway, who's the army
attacking the castle right now?@0003
@000CRoy and the Lycia Alliance Army!
They came here to defeat the@0003
bandits.@0003
@0009Lycia, eh?
They've sure come a far
way to get here...@0003
@0009And does it look like
they'll help us out?@0003
@000C@0013Yes!
They helped me too.@0003
@0009@0014All right,
then I guess I'll join too!@0003
That's okay, isn't it?@0003
@000CReally?
That would be great!@0003
I'm sure Roy would be
glad too.@0003
[F7]

[F8]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0182
Oh! You're with the
resistance, eh?@0003
@000CEh? No? Ahhh, I see...
It seems like enemies are@0003
everywhere..@0003
Here, please take this!
We really believe in you.@0003

[F9]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0189
@0017I'm supposed to be giving
this staff to Oro...@0003
He buys all this stuff with the
money he steals from us.@0003
But I'm going to give this
weapon to you instead!@0003
Please don't lose...
For our sake.@0003
[FA]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018B
My job is to take the village's
money to the castle.@0003
If I don't do that, the
village'll be burnt down.@0003
But I'm going to give the
money to you guys!@0003
I'm tired over being overrun
by this oppression.@0003
I decided as soon as I
saw all of you.@0003
[FB]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015C
@000CStaves!
Do ya need any staves from me?@0003
Hmm?
Have I met you before..?@0003
Ah, probably just my imagination...@0003
Anyway, how many staves do
you want?@0003@0002
@0017They work really well, they heal@0005
conditions instead of health.@0003
Not going to buy one?! Darn!
I'll give you one for free,@0003
but you better buy one next
time!@0003

[FC]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018C@000CPlease take this!@0003
@000CI wanna help in any way I can.
This is a magic wing!@0003
@000CIf you use it,
you'll get faster!@0003
@000CReally! But if you don't believe
in your heart, it won't work.@0003
[FD]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0188
@000C@0017It's such a hard life
under Oro's rule...@0003
He steals everything from us,
even our hopes and future...@0003
All we can do is live and keep
living the best way we can..@0003
I want you to take this to help.@0003
[FE]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0183
@000CGood luck to you!
We can't even touch these guys.@0003
@000CYou have friends who can
use bows, right?@0003
@000CThis should be helpful
to 'em.@0003
@000CIt's not much...
But please take it.@0003
[FF]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0185
@0017This dusty old spear?
If you want it, I'll give it to you@0003
if you beat the enemies.@0003
@000CMy stupid brother used this
while he was still living.@0003
@000C@0017Even though he was weak, he
acted like he fought for justice.@0003
@000CWhat a stupid person...@0003
@0002
@000C@0017So very stupid...@0003
[0100]
@0010@0140@0017Going against me...
is the same thing as@0003
going against God!@0003@0002
Take your punishment from
my hands!@0003
[0101]
@0010@0140@0017You...
You heathen...@0003@0002
... I represent God...
Gah...!!@0003
[0102]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Master Roy, there is a young man
here who says he is a member of@0003
the resistance forces...@0003
@000C@0017I'll see him.
Let him pass.@0003@0009@0011
@0008@0010@012BAh, so you are Roy?
Pleased to meet you,@0003
my name is Elphin.@0003
I am a member of the
resistance here.@0003
@000CI am Roy of the
Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@0008My thanks for saving
our village here.@0003
@000CNo, we simply did what
we thought was right.@0003
@0008@0017But now you have rebelled
against Etruria.@0003
Certainly you had thought of
that before you took action?@0003
@000CEven so,
we did what we felt was right.@0003
Although what we did was a sign
of rebellion against Etruria,@0003
if the truth about these islands
is made public, they will understand.@0003
I have sent a letter to a trustworthy
member of the Etrurian nobility.@0003
If she takes the appropriate
measures, I'm sure we can tip@0003
the tables in our favor.@0003
@0008I would not be so
sure of that...@0003
@000CWhat do you mean?@0003
@0008Did you ever think it strange
Etruria sent you in to get@0003
rid of bandits?@0003
@000CActually...
Yes, of course.@0003
@0008There is merely my theory..
But I believe the ones who @0003
requested your help, are
Advisor Roartz and Lord Arcard.@0003
@000C... How do you know that?@0003
@0008Why did those two have to get
your army off of the mainland?@0003
Could there be some kind of problem
if you stayed in Lycia?@0003
[0103]
@0009@0010@0182@000C@0010@0102
@0009Ah,
are you General Roy?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
@0009You saved our village.@0003
Take this as a token of our
gratitude.@0003
[0104]
@0009@0010@0146@000C@0010@013F
@0009@0080@000B@0017G-G...  General Flaer!@0003
@000C@0017Ah, Lord Arcard.
Why do you fret so?@0003
@0009@0080@000B@0017It is the Lycia Alliance Army!@0003
They are approaching here to
take my head!@0003
@000C@0017Oh, them.@0003
They are somewhat of a nuisance
to us of Bern...@0003
We figured it would get difficult
if they became friendly with Etruria,@0003
so we had you send them here...@0003
Well... they fight better
than I would have expected.@0003
@0009@0080@000B@0017What are you saying!
Do you know how much I have@0003
lost because of them?
All the riches that I've earned@0003
from these islands... N-No!
Before that, my life!@0003
My life is in danger!@0003
If they reach here,
I am done for!@0003
What must I do...@0003
@000C@0017If you are that worried,
you should leave this capital@0003
and escape back to Etruria.@0003
@0009@0013@0017Are you sure?@0003
@000C@0014@0017Warfare is what Bern is best at.
And besides, we have our secret@0003
weapon at hand.@0003
We shall kill off the Lycia
Alliance Army once and for all.@0003
@0009@0012@0017But...@0003
@000C@0014@0017Lord Arcard.@0003
If Bern and Etruria join
forces, we shall have nothing@0003
on this continent to fear.
Isn't that so?@0003
@0009@0013Yes... Yes!
You're right.@0003
Then I shall ask for your
assistance.@0003@0011
[0105]
@000C@0010@013F@0017Hmph, the weakness of those
Etrurian nobles.@0003
But if we can get rid of the
@0017alliance here, these isles@0003
shall be ours forever...@0003
[0106]
@000C@0010@0102@0017This is the capital...
Once we take it down,@0003
we can go home.@0003
@0009@0010@012BMaster Roy,@0003
I have heard some strange rumors
from the people living around here.@0003
They say a 'human not a human'
resides in this castle.@0003
@000CWhat does that mean?@0003
@0009They say he changes form...
into a Dragon.@0003
@000C@0080@000DA human?
Turning into a dragon?@0003
@0009I can say nothing at this point.
We must proceed with caution.@0003
[0107]
@000B@0010@0102@0017This is the capital...
@0017Once we take it down,@0003
we can go home.@0003
@001C@000D@0010@012B@0017I have sent someone in
already to unlock the gate...@0003@0008@0010@0126
@000DOh,
there she is.@0003@001C
@000BThe one over there
dressed like a dancer?@0003
@001C@000DYes.@0003@001C
@0008@0017Your Majesty!
@0080@000AOver@0080@000A here~!@0003
@000B@0017Your Majesty?@0003
@001C@000D...I know not of
what she speaks of.@0003
@0008@0080@000C@0017Your Majesty!
You're late.@0003
@000D@0017Lalum,
who is 'Your Majesty'?@0003@001C
@000A?...Oh!
Ah...er...@0003
@000A@0080@000BYou know,
you look so much@0003
@0017like a prince, so I
gave you a nickname!@0003
@001C@000D@0016......@0003@001C
@000B......@0016@0003
@001C@000D@0017My apologies,
Master Roy.@0003
This is Lalum,
a member of the resistance.@0003
@001C
@0009@0017You're Roy?@0003
Everyone on these islands has
heard of you!@0003
They call you the
'Savior from the East'.@0003
@0009@0080@000CNice to meet you,
I'm Lalum.@0003
@000B@0080@000D@0017Whoa!
Please leave a little distance!@0003
@000A@0017Roy, your face is all red.
How cute~~~!!!@0003@001C
@000D@0017...Lalum...@0003@001C
@000A@0080@000BOh! R-Right...
I've been hearing strange rumors.@0003
The people here say that a 'human
not human' resides in this castle.@0003
@000BA human not human...?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
They say he changes form into a
creature nobody has ever seen before.@0003
say it looked like one of the
legendary Dragons!@0003
@000BA human?
Turning into a Dragon!?@0003
@0009I don't know...
but maybe.@0003
@001C@000DWe must
proceed with caution.@0003@001C
[0108]
@0009@0010@0141@000C@0010@013FAh, there you are,
Aine.@0003
@0009@0013@0017I heard you called...@0003
@000C@0014I will go report about the Lycia
Alliance Army to General Narshen.@0003
I want you to defend this castle
while I am away.@0003
@0009@0012... Understood.@0003
@000C@0013Hm?
Who's there!@0003@0002@0006
@0016...... Just the wind...@0003@0007@0002
@0016Well then, I shall be going.
I leave the rest to you.@0003
@0009@0012...Understood.@0003@0011
@000C@0014Haha... The Lycia Alliance
won't stand a chance against@0003
this Dragon.@0003
They won't even be able to
scratch it with normal weapons.@0003
These mamkutes...
They certainly are terrible beasts.@0003
[0109]
@000C@0010@0125...So that's what the
'human not human' is.@0003
So it is true that Bern has
brought back the Dragons@0003
into this world.@0003
... So what can I do now...@0003
@0017I guess I'll act like one
of the soldiers and@0003
observe the Dragons power.@0003
[010A]
@000C@0010@012CAll the way down here
in the isles in the west,@0003
people working to death for
the nobles in their nest!@0003
Well, if that's true, this castle
must be loaded with treasure!@0003
The loot wasn't earned rightfully
by the nobles anyway, so I guess@0003
I'll grab it all for myself!@0003
[010B]
@0009@0010@0141@000C@0010@01D7The reinforcements from the
south will arrive shortly!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016......T-that's all,
Sir.@0003
@0009@0011@000CThat guy
scares me...@0003
[010C]
@000C@0010@01D7@0017
Did you take care of
the cave on the outskirts?@0003
@0009@0010@01DB
Yes, sir.@0003
We hired the bandits
to block the entrance.@0003
No one will be able to
get the Divine Weapon now.@0003
@000CGreat!@0003
Now all we have to do is get
rid of the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
[010D]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0121
@000C@0013Ray? Ray!
It's good to see you!@0003
@0009@0017Lugh...!
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0014@0017I'm glad that you
look okay.@0003
We were worried.
You just left one day,@0003
saying that you were 'going on a
journey to train your magic skills'.@0003
@0009I wouldn't be able to
effectively learn magic sitting@0003
in that orphanage.@0003
It was a miracle that I
could learn what I did.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Ray...
The orphanage is gone.@0003
@0009@0014?
What happened?@0003
@000CBern's forces came...
and burned it down.@0003
@0009... What happened to everybody?@0003
@000CFather was killed
protecting us...@0003
The little children are under the
protection of the Elimine Church.@0003
@0009... I see.@0003
Good...they'll be happier
living with the church@0003
instead of an old orphanage.@0003
@000CYou don't have to say
it that way.@0003
@0009@0016@0012......@0003
@000C@0016@0014Ray!
Come with us.@0003
Let's defeat Bern and
pick up the little ones!@0003
@0009I don't find
interest in such things.@0003
@000CBut!@0003
@0009@0014@0017Still... the Lycia Alliance Army
might not be a bad place to be.@0003
They seem to have some kind of
connection with the Dragons.@0003
So if you insist,
I suppose I can go with you.@0003
@000C@0012Ray...@0003
@0009@0014@0017I hope you understand!@0003
I'm not joining to avenge Father
or the orphanage or anything!@0003
@000C@0013@0017Yes!
I know, Ray.@0003
@0009@0014@0017So don't look
at me like that!@0003
[010E]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0111
@000C@0017Ray!
What're you doing here?@0003
@0009My thoughts exactly.
What are you doing here?@0003
What happened to the
orphanage?@0003
@000C@0013... So you are concerned, even
though you just ran off like that.@0003
@0009@0014I was never concerned.
You just reminded me of it.@0003
@000C@0013... The orphanage is gone.@0003
@0009What do you mean?@0003
@000C@0014Bern's troops burned it to the
ground when they invaded Lycia.@0003
Father...
He was...@0003
@0009@0013What!?
They killed Father...?@0003
@000C@0014I'm going to avenge Father.
I know we're stuck on these islands@0003
right now, but I know we'll go
back to the mainland stand up@0003
against Bern some day...!@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CWell, I suppose there's no
point in telling you, is there.@0003
@0009... I'll go with you.@0003
@000C@0013What?!
For real?@0003
@0009@0014@0017Bern seems to be tied in
with the Dragons.@0003
I'm curious about them.@0003
@000C@0012... Fine.@0003
Just don't
get in the way.@0003
[010F]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0121
@000C@0013Ray? Ray!
It's good to see you!@0003
@0009@0017Lugh...!
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0014@0017I'm glad that you
look okay.@0003
We were worried.
You just left one day,@0003
saying that you were 'going on a
journey to train your magic skills'.@0003
@0009I wouldn't be able to
effectively learn magic sitting@0003
in that orphanage.@0003
It was a miracle that I
could learn what I did.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Ray...
The orphanage is gone.@0003
@0009@0014?
What happened?@0003
@000CBern's forces came...
and burned it down.@0003
@0009... What happened to everybody?@0003
@000CFather was killed
protecting us...@0003
The little children are under the
protection of the Elimine Church.@0003
@0009... I see.@0003
Good...they'll be happier
living with the church@0003
instead of an old orphanage.@0003
@000CYou don't have to say
it that way.@0003
@0009@0016@0012......@0003
@000C@0016@0014Ray!
Come with us.@0003
Let's defeat Bern and
pick up the little ones!@0003
@0009I don't find
interest in such things.@0003
@000CBut!@0003
@0009@0014@0017Still... the Lycia Alliance Army
might not be a bad place to be.@0003
They seem to have some kind of
connection with the Dragons.@0003
So if you insist,
I suppose I can go with you.@0003
@000C@0012Ray...@0003
@0009@0014@0017I hope you understand!@0003
I'm not joining to avenge Father
or the orphanage or anything!@0003
@000C@0013@0017Yes!
I know, Ray.@0003
@0009@0014@0017So don't look
at me like that!@0003
[0110]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0111
@000C@0017Ray!
What're you doing here?@0003
@0009My thoughts exactly.
What are you doing here?@0003
What happened to the
orphanage?@0003
@000C@0013... So you are concerned,
even though you just ran off like that.@0003
@0009@0014I was never concerned.
You just reminded me of it.@0003
@000C@0013...The orphanage is gone.@0003
@0009What do you mean?@0003
@000C@0014Bern's troops burned it to
the ground when they invaded Lycia.@0003
Father...
He was...@0003
@0009@0013!?
They killed Father...?@0003
@000C@0014I'm going to avenge Father.
I know we're suck on these islands@0003
right now, but I know we'll go
back to the mainland stand up@0003
against Bern some day...!@0003
 @0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CWell, I suppose there's no
point in telling you, is there.@0003
@0009... I'll go with you.@0003
@000C@0013What?!
For real?@0003
@0009@0014@0017Bern seems to be tied in
with the Dragons.@0003
I'm curious about them.@0003
@000C@0012... Fine. Just don't
get in the way.@0003
[0111]
@0010@0141@0017...Burn.@0003
[0112]
@0010@0141@0017...What...!@0003
[0113]
@000B@0010@0102@0013@0017That was close...@0003
The power of a Dragon... amazing.@0003
@0009@0010@012BA human not human...
This is what it meant.@0003@001C
@000BHow many more of these
does Bern have...?@0003
@0006How are we supposed to put up a
fight against monsters like this!?@0003
@0009Master Roy!
Please calm yourself.@0003
@000BOh...@0003
@0009...I understand your worries.@0003
But if you start to panic, everyone
in this army will start to get@0003
anxious.
Please understand that.@0003
@000B@0080@000E...I'm sorry.@0003
@0009No, it is a perfectly understandable
reaction after fighting something@0003
like that.@0003
But now... we know something
that we did not before.@0003
@000CWhat is that?@0003
@0009Do you not remember?@0003
I told you of the rumor
that Arcard was tied in@0003
with Bern.@0003
@000COh!@0003
If there are Bern's Dragons in
the Etrurian capital...@0003
@0009So Arcard was indeed
taking contract with Bern.@0003
@000C...That means Lycia is in danger...@0003
We must return to the mainland.
We have to contact General Cecilia@0003
and think of a plan...@0003

[0114]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Master Roy, before returning@0003
to the mainland, we still
have things to do on these isles.@0003
@000CAre there still more enemies?@0003
@0009No.
One of the Divine Weapons@0003
is hidden in a cave near here.@0003
If we can obtain it,
fighting the Dragons will@0003
become a little easier.@0003
@000CDivine Weapon... Exactly!
If we can get all eight of them,@0003
we have a chance of defeating Bern!@0003
@0009Yes... we must obtain@0003
as many as we can.@0003
@000CThen let's go
to the cave you speak of!@0003
[0115]
@0008@0010@0152@000B@0010@0102
@0008@0017R-Report!@0003
I have a message from Etruria...@0003
A rebellion has broken out at the
Etrurian Castle City of Aquleia.@0003@001C
@000D@0010@0154@0013What!@0003@001C
@0008@0014The rebel leaders are
Advisor Roartz and Lord Arcard.@0003
They have captured King Mordred,
and they are announcing their plan@0003
to divide ownership of the world
between Bern and Etruria!@0003@001C
@000DNo... the two strongest nations
in Elibe joining forces...@0003
@001C
@000BIs General Cecilia all right!?
And how about Princess Guinevere...@0003
@0008We do not have accurate
information...@0003
But it seems like the Three
Etrurian Generals have split up.@0003
Sorcery General Cecilia has escaped
from Aquleia and is headed@0003
for the Island of Misul
in the west.@0003
@000BWhat about the other Generals?@0003
@0008They have been forced to join
the rebels because King Mordred@0003
was taken hostage.@0003@001C
@000D@0012Master Roy...@0003@001C
@000B@0013We need to contact
General Cecilia...@0003
Princess Guinevere...@0003
General Cecilia...
Please be safe...@0003
[0116]
@0009@0010@013F@000C@0010@0142
@000C@0013@0017Hasn't the castle gone down yet!?@0003
@0009@0014My lord, the Anti-Rebels led by
General Cecilia are fighting harder@0003
than expected...@0003@0011
@000CCecilia...!
Her again!@0003
Always interfering with my plans!@0003@0006
[0117]
@000C@0010@0142@000A@0010@0149
@000A@0017I see you are having trouble,
Narshen.@0003
@000A@0011@0008@0010@014B@0016......@0016@0003
@0008@0011@000A@0010@0149
@000CY-Your Majesty!?
When...did you arrive?@0003
@000A@0014Just now.@0003
The general from Etruria fights well,
I see.@0003
@000C@0013Yes... But we shall have everything
under control very soon.@0003
@000A@0014No, let me.
I will fight her myself.@0003@001C
@000C@0011@0008@0010@014B@0013Your Highness, there is
no reason for you to fight...@0003@001C
@000A@0014No matter.
It shall be some good exercise.@0003@001C@0008@0011@001C@000C@0010@0142
@000A@0014Narshen,
show me to her.@0003
[0118]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0012@0017What's the story?@0003
@0009@0014The castle hasn't
fallen yet, Master Roy.@0003
@000C@0013Good!
We have to hurry, then.@0003
[0119]
@000C@0010@0134@000A@0010@0149
@000A@0017So you are Cecilia,
the Sorcery General.@0003
@000C@0012!!
...King Zephiel...@0003
@000A@0014For your prowess in battle, you have
the honor to fight me one on one.@0003
@000C@0013@0016...@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0016!!@0003
[011A]
@0010@0134@0017Too...
powerful...@0006@0003
[011B]
@000A@0010@0149@0017Lost consciousness...
I would have expected more.@0003
@0008@0010@0142@0013@0017Your Majesty!
Invincible, as usual.@0003@001C
@000A@0014@0017I suppose this is all one could
expect from an Etrurian General.@0003
@0008@0011@000C@0010@0142@0017Your Majesty.@0003
If you would allow it,
can you leave her to me?@0003
@000A@0012@0017Hm?@0003
@000C@0014@0017I have some certain... bad memories
with her.@0003
I want to punish her for them.@0003
@000A@0013@0017Well, all right.
Do with her as you wish.@0003@0011
@000C@0014@0017Thank you very much, Your Majesty.@0006
You, make one of the prison cells ready.@0003
@0008@0010@01D7Yes, General Narshen.@0003
[011C]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@011A@0017Bern is attacking the castle?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
@000C...This isn't what they said.@0003
They had decided to leave the Etrurian
matters to us Etrurians.@0003
@0009What shall we do?@0003
@000CWas it General Narshen who made
the order to attack the castle?@0003
@0009No, sir.
It was King Zephiel himself.@0003
@000C!
The king did it himself...@0003
@0009@0011@000CSo it looks like Bern had
no intention of leaving anything to@0003
us in the first place.@0003
@0009@0010@01D7@000CWe are going to move right now.
Tell the rest of them that.@0003
@0009Yes!@0003@0011
@000C@0016......@0003
[011D]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0013@0017The castle has fallen?@0003
@0009Yes...
We were too late.@0003
@000CIs General Cecilia alright?@0003
@0009@0014There hasn't been a report that
she was killed, but probably...@0003
@000CWell, if there's still a possibility
that she's alive, then I won't@0003
give up.
We have to hurry!@0003
[011E]
@000B@0010@0149@0008@0010@0142
@0008@0017Your Majesty!
We have found Princess Guinevere.@0003
@000B@0013Show her to me.@0003
[011F]
@000B@0010@0149@0009@0010@0157@0017My brother...@0003
@000B@0013Guinevere.
So good to see you.@0003@0080@0004
@0009@0014Zephiel, why?@0003
Why do you cause a war, killing@0003
innocent people...@0003
@000BInnocent, you say?
Hmph, jealousy, vanity, greed...@0003
People are fighting over these silly
things in every nation.@0003
And you say they are innocent?@0003
@0009@0012Well...@0003
@000B@0014The world must be liberated
from such pointless things that@0003
men fight over.
That is the purpose of this war.@0003
@0009But... people are being
brutally killed in the process.@0003
@000BSacrifice is always needed
in a radical change.@0003
That is nothing new.@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0012Zephiel...!@0003
@000B@0014Guinevere, you are my only sister.@0003
Therefore,
I will forgive you this time.@0003
But not the next.
Do you understand?@0003
@0008@0012@0016......@0016@0003@0080@0004
@000B@0014Narshen!@0003
The leader of Guinevere's defenders
is here, no?@0003
@000A@0010@0142Yes.
Her name is Miledy.@0003
@000BAll right.@0003
Tell her to take Guinevere
back to Bern.@0003
Also tell her to make sure that
the Fire Emblem is returned to@0003
the Temple of the Seals.@0003
@000A@0012Yes.@0003@0011
@0008Zephiel...@0003
[0120]
@000C@0010@0157@0009@0010@012E
@000C@0012@0017Miledy...@0003
@0009@0014@0017Princess Guinevere, it is good to
see that you are safe. @0003
@0009@0080@000C@0013Now, let us return to
Bern on my mount...@0003
@0012@0017Princess?@0003
@000C@0080@000FMiledy!@0003
@000A@0014W-What are you doing!?@0003
Please put down that sword
before you are hurt!@0003
@000D@0013Miledy, please!
Let me go!@0003
@000A@0012!!@0003
@0014...Should I oblige,
what would you do next?@0003
@000D@0014...I understand that Roy of the
Lycia Alliance Army is near here...@0003
@000A@0013!?@0005
You would join the Enemy!?@0003
@000D@0014If we do nothing, the world will
be overrun by Bern's forces...@0003
No matter what kind of reasoning he
gives, what he is doing is the same.@0003
He is forcing others into submission
through power.@0003
And I do not think that will lead
to anything good...@0003
@000A@0012@0016......@0003
@000D@0014@0016Miledy,
I ask you to let me go.@0003
@000A@0012...There is one thing.@0003
@000D?@0003
@000A@0014There is one thing I cannot
forgive you for, Your Highness.@0003
When you left Bern earlier, why did
you not come and ask for my opinion...?@0003
@000D@0080@000E@0013Well... I thought your
reputation would be damaged.@0003
@000A@0014Did you think I would
prioritize my reputation above you?@0003
I am your loyal Knight more
than I am a Knight of Bern.@0003
That has not changed since
I was knighted.@0003
@000C@0012Miledy...@0003
@000A@0014@0017So if you told me to let you go, then I
would follow your order with pleasure.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0013Miledy...
Thank you...@0003
[0121]
@000B@0010@0102
@0008@0010@012E@0013@0017Please stop attacking!
I am not an enemy!@0003
@000BWhat?
Everyone, lower your weapons!@0003
@0008@0011@001C@000D@0010@0154Master Roy,
she may be lying...@0003@001C
@000B@0014She may be a messenger.@0003
Killing a messenger goes
against the knight's way.@0003
@001C@000D@0016@0012......@0003@0011@B882@001C
@0008@0010@012E@0016@0013Are you General Roy?@0003
@000B...Yes.
And you are?@0003
@0008@0011@0009@0010@0157@0012Roy!@0003
@000B@0013Princess Guinevere!?@0003
@0017You were safe.@0003
@0009Yes...
I escaped with her assistance.@0003@0011
@0008@0010@012EMy name is Miledy.@0003
@0011
@0009@0010@0157@0014Roy,
General Cecilia is alive.@0003
@000B@0013R-Really?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
Though she is severely wounded, she
is alive.@0003
She is in the prison cell right now.@0003
@000B@0014@0017Thank you!
We have to rescue her!@0003
[0122]
@0008@0010@014B@000B@0010@0149
@000B@0013@0017Are they ready?@0003
@0008Yes.@0003
The Dragons are prepared to
fight at your command.@0003@0011
@000B@0014Narshen.@0003@0009@0010@0142
@000BI will give you some Dragons to
fortify your militia.@0003
I want you to send some
of your troops to Nabata.@0003
@0009The Nabata Desert?@0003
The desert lands located in the
center of this peninsula?@0003
@000BRight.@0003
I heard that there is a hidden
village there where Dragons have been@0003
staying since the Scouring.@0003
@0009I see... then there is a high chance
that a Divine Weapon is located there.@0003
@000BExactly.@0003
They must not fall into the hands
of the enemy.@0003
I already sent some
troops to start attacking,@0003
but they are outnumbered.@0003
@0009@0017Yes, Your Majesty.@0003
I shall have the village
taken in no time.@0003
@000B@0017...I shall remember those words.@0003
@0009@0012Of course!@0003
[0123]
@000D@0010@0134
@0013@0017...Oh...
Where am I... ...!@0080@000F@0003
@0008@0010@012D
You're still not well...
You shouldn't move...@0003
@000DDid you treat my wounds?@0003
@0008@0014...Yes... I wasn't used to
it, so...@0003
Maybe I didn't do a good job...@0003
@000DYes, you did.
Thank you.@0003
We must find a way out
of here...@0003
...Ow...!@0003
@0008@0080@000B
Don't move...
The wound will open again.@0003
@000D@0013But I must do something...@0003
@0009@0014It will be all right.@0003
I can see a light... that
will be here soon to help...@0003
@000D@0012Light?@0003
@0009@0014Yes.
That light will aid us both...@0003
We must wait for it...@0003
@000D@0013Who are you...?@0003
@0009@0014I am Sophia...
A priestess of Arcadia...@0003
@000D@0012What is 'Arcadia'?@0003
@0009@0014I shall tell you more about it later...
Right now, please trust me...@0003
[0124]
@0009@0010@013F@000C@0010@0142
@0009@0017General Narshen!
It's them!@0003
The Lycia Alliance Army!@0003
@000CWhat!?
Flaer!@0003
I thought you had taken care
of them at Djuto!@0003
@0009I did!@0003
Well... I left a Dragon to
deal with them, so...@0003
I never thought they would
have survived!@0003
@000CWhat!@0003
In that case, my reputation as your
Commanding Officer is also jeopardized!@0003
If I can't defeat the
Lycia Alliance Army here, people@0003
will start to suspect my ability...@0003
I must do something...
But they defeated a Dragon...@0003
They seem to be tougher
Than I expected.@0003
@0009General Narshen...
What should we do...?@0003
@000CI have no choice...
Flaer.@0003
I will return to Aquleia and
plan an attack on the@0003
Lycia Alliance Army.
Flaer, you stay here.@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0013!
M-Me... Stay here?@0003
@000CYou don't have to defeat them.@0003
I just want you to hit them as
hard as you can and decrease@0003
their numbers.@0003
@0008General Narshen!
You would use me as cannon fodder!@0003
@000C@0014@0017Flaer...@0003
To tell you the truth, you would
have been executed a long time@0003
ago when you failed to capture
the Western Isles.@0003
I'm giving you a chance to prove
your worth again.@0003
You should be thankful.
Hehehe...@0003
@0008@0012@0017But...!@0003
@000C@0080@000DOr do you want me to carry
out your execution right here?@0003
@0008Yes...sir...
Understood.@0003
@000B@0017Good.
Then I leave the rest to you.@0003@0011
[0125]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@01D7
@0017Yes, what is it,
General Percival?@0003
@0009We're leaving.@0003
@000CWhat?
Are you sure?@0003
@0009Bern's actions are clearly an act of
insult to us of Etruria.@0003
I cannot aid Bern any further
We must return to Aquleia and@0003
inform Lord Douglas of this
and plan our future actions.@0003
Retreat at once!@0003
@000CYes, sir!@0003
[0126]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0165
Here, take this ring.@0003
It builds up your muscles
when you wear it.@0003
... I wouldn't recommend it
for the ladies, though.@0003
[0127]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0164
See this sword?@0003
I got it to defend myself because
I heard an army was approaching,@0003
but I can't seem to use it
very well.@0003
It's a nice sword, eh?@0003
It was used by a brave kid who
was standing up against Bern@0003
like you guys.@0003
Here, I'll give it to you,
so use it to end this war!@0003
[0128]

[012E]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0166
Cecilia, Percival, and Douglas!
They're the Three Etrurian Generals.@0003
They won't even lose to the
Three Dragon Lords of Bern.@0003
... I know they won't.@0003
[012F]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0164
@0017General Cecilia...@0003
She was defeated in one hit..@0003
That's...@0006
That's the power...@0003
of King Zephiel...@0003
[0130]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015C
General Percival is still swearing@0003
his loyalty to Prince Mildain even
after he passed away.@0003
That's so sweet...@0003
[0131]
@0010@013F
Damn...@0003@0002
But I am a Knight of Bern!
I will not surrender!@0003
[0132]
@0010@013F
Remember this...
There are...@0003
plenty of warriors
greater than I...@0003@0002
Bern's army shall...
annihilate you...@0003
For sure...@0003
[0133]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0013@0017General Cecilia!@0003
@0009Roy... I have made a fool out
of myself in front of you.@0003
@000CNo, of course not!
I am relieved that you are alive...@0003
But what of your wounds?
Are you all right?@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@012D@000A@0010@0134
@000A@0014@0017Yes.
This girl treated them for me.@0003
@000C@0012@0017And you are?@0003@001C
@0008@0013I am Sophia...
A priestess of Arcadia...@0003@001C
@000A@0017She prophesized that
you were coming.@0003
And you also said that you
@0017would tell us more once@0003
we were safe.@0003@0011@0080@0004
@0008@0014Yes... Arcadia, our home, lies
to the east in the Nabata desert.@0003
We tried to stay an
isolated people... but Bern@0003
found out about us, and...@0003
@000C@0013They attacked you?@0003
@0008@0014Yes...@0003
I... was too slow,
and I was captured.@0003
@000CI see... but why would Bern
attack a small village like yours?@0003
@0008I don't know...@0003
Maybe they found out about the
Dragons that live in Arcadia.@0003
@000C@0080@000DDragons!?@0003
@0008Yes...
Arcadia was built by Dragons and people@0003
joining forces a long time ago...@0003
@000B@0013...Such a place existed...@0003
@0008Master Roy...
Please, save our village...@0003
@000D@0010@0154@0014But the story does seem
a bit unbelievable.@0003
@0008@0016@0012......@0003
@000D@0011@000B@0016@0014In any case, it's probably true that
her village is under attack by Bern.@0003
We owe Sophia anyway because
she helped General Cecilia.@0003
@0008...Thank you.@0003
@000BThen, can you tell me
more about your village@0003
and the Dragons?@0003
@0008...Yes... I will gladly
tell you what I know...@0003
[0134]
@0009@0010@01DC@000C@0010@011A
@0009@0017General Percival,
until further instructions are@0003
given, we will station ourselves in
this castle and prepare for further@0003
coup d'etat attacks.@0003
@000CGood.@0003
@0009Here, we found this in the castle.
Please take it.@0003
General Percival, please take care...
of Etruria.@0003
@000CI know.
Leave it to me.@0003
@0009Yes!@0003
[0135]
@000A@0010@011B@000D@0010@0104
@000A@0013@0017Hurry, Fa!@0003
If you follow this path,
there is a place to hide.@0003
Can you make it there?@0003
@000D@0080@000FBut...
Fa's tired!@0003
@000A@0014Don't be stubborn.@0003
Now go, or else Bern's
soldiers might find us.@0003
@000D@0013What about Sophia?@0003
@000A@0014I don't know...@0003
Maybe she was caught by
Bern's troops.@0003
@000DIf we get caught by Bern, then
can we see the outside world?@0003
@000AFa, no.@0003
The elder said that we mustn't
communicate with the outside world.@0003
@000D@0080@000F@0012Aw...
Please?@0003
@000A@0014No.@0003
... But I wonder how Bern
found out about our village...@0003
Perhaps it has something to do
with the ominous 'force' that@0003
Sophia said she detected
from the soldiers...@0003
@000DWhat's wrong?@0003
@000A!@0003
I shouldn't be thinking about
such matters now!@0003
Fa!
Over here, hurry!@0003
@000D@0013... Fa wants to see
outside world too.@0003
[0136]
@000C@0010@01C9@0009@0010@012A
@000C@0017Zeiss!
Hasn't General Narshen arrived yet?@0003
@0009A band of mercenaries and some
Dragons have arrived as@0003
reinforcements, but General
Narshen's group hasn't arrived yet.@0003
@000CWhat is he doing?@0003
He must know it is impossible to
take over the village with@0003
such a small army like this...@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000C@0014Anyway, we must inform the King
about the Dragons that live here.@0003
Zeiss, I want you to go to Aquleia
and report to King Zephiel.@0003
@0009@0013What do you want
me to say?@0003
@000C@0014Dragons do indeed inhabit
this village.@0003
According to a captive, there are
also signs of 'Divine Dragons,'@0003
the most powerful even among Dragons.@0003
... Tell him that.@0003
@0009@0012Yes sir.@0003
@000CMake it quick.@0003
[0137]
@0008@0010@012D@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0013@0017This is some sandstorm.@0003
@0008@0014Yes... this sandstorm has always@0003
protected our village from intruders.@0003
@000CWell, it must be a pain trying
to look for a village in this mess.@0003
I can't see three meters ahead...
So in which direction do we move?@0003
@0008Yes...
Head to the Northeast...@0003
But...@0003
@000C@0012But?@0003
@0008@0014There may be many things
hidden in the sand, blown@0003
around by the sandstorm...
Please be careful where you step.@0003
[0138]
@0008@0010@01D2@000D@0010@01D1
@0017Maggie my dear, did we not see someone
head towards the middle of the desert?@0003
@0008Yes, Rose, you are most correct.@0003
@000D@0080@000D
Then, Maggie, it must be true that
there is a hidden village around here.@0003
@0008@0080@000CBless my soul, Rose,
I believe you are correct.@0003
@000B@0080@000EBut, my dear Maggie, we don't want
to get lost in the sandstorm, do we?@0003
@000A@0080@000BOf course not, Rose.@0003
Then we wouldn't be able to
find our way home.@0003
@000C@0080@000FWell then, Maggie, do you think we
should pass up the hidden village?@0003
@0009@0080@000AMy dear Rose, you forget
there are rumors of vast@0003
treasures hidden in this village.@0003@000D@0080@000D
Well, we certainly don't want to
miss that, do we, Maggie?@0003
@0008@0080@000COf course, Rose.@0003
We can make a lot more money
through that than by mugging@0003
travelers.@0003@001C
@000B@0080@000FBut we don't want to get
lost either, do we, Maggie?@0003@001C
@000A@0080@000AMy dear Rose,
I have an idea.@0003
We may follow the people
we saw heading into@0003
the desert earlier.@0003
@001C
@000DThat's a wonderful idea, Maggie.@0003
And once we reach the village,
we can thank them by smashing@0003
their heads in.@0003
@0008@0080@000COf course, my dear Rose.@0003
@001C
@000DWell then, Maggie,
shall we be off?@0003
@000A@0080@000F@0013Why certainly,
my dear Rose.@0003@001C
@0009Certainly,
my dear Maggie.@0003
[0139]
@000C@0010@0102@0013@0017The sandstorm... it stopped.@0003
@000A@0010@0154@0014This is our chance, Master Roy!
We can see the village clearly now!@0003
@000CBut so can the enemy.
We have to hurry!@0003
[013A]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@01C9
@0009@0017Sir Randy, we have finished
searching the village.@0003
@000C@0013Did you find the divine weapon?@0003
@0009@0014No...@0003
But we destroyed any passageways
that might lead to it.@0003
@000CGood.@0003
Now all we have to do is
stop the Alliance Army.@0003
[013B]
@0009@0010@012D
Something...is glittering in the sand...@0005
Oh...@0003
A beautiful ring...@0003

[013C]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0161
Have you heard of the sky god,
Delphi?@0003
He is an ancient god said to race
through the vast sky and protect@0003
all living things.
They say that with his blessing,@0003
wyverns and pegasi can fly freely
without danger...@0003
[013D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0173
There are a lot of things
buried in the sand.@0003
If you're really lucky, you might
find something.@0003
Try looking around
the bones.@0003
[013E]
@0010@01D1
Bless my soul, Maggie...
It hurts, does it not?@0003
[013F]
@0010@01D2
Bless my soul, Rose...
It hurts, does it not?@0003
[0140]
@0010@01C9
My sword is impenetrable.
Now, choose your death.@0003@0005
By the blade...
or by its light?@0003
[0141]
@0010@01C9
I am glad...that I could@0003@0002
meet one so strong as you...@0003
before my death.@0003
[0142]
@000D@0010@012D@000B@0010@0102
@000B@0017He was a tough opponent...
but we won.@0003
Sophia, where are the
inhabitants of the village?@0003@0002@0014What's wrong?@0003@001C
@000D... The entrance to the temple...@0003@001C
@000BThis door...@0003
It looks like it has been
forced open.@0003
What lies inside this temple?@0003
@001C
@000DThere is something we call the
Divine Weapon...@0003
It is a spell book.@0003@001C
@000BDivine Weapon!?
There was one here, too!?@0003
... Then that must be

what Bern was after!@0003
In that case,
we may be too late.@0003
@001C
@000DIt is there...
I can feel it...@0003@001C
@000B@0011@000A@0010@0102@0013All right!@0003
@000ALet's go!@0003@0002
We may still be able
to stop Bern!@0003

[0143]
@000A@0010@016E@0013@0017Who are you?
How did you enter?@0003
@000C@0010@0102@0014My name is Roy.@0003
I came with Sophia to protect
this village.@0003
@000A@0013With Sophia...?@0003
Then it was you who drove
off Bern's soldiers?@0003
Oh...
Please forgive my impudence.@0003
I am the Elder of Arcadia.@0003
@000CElder...
Then are you the Dragon?@0003
@000ADragon...
They once called me that.@0003
But that is a story of a time
long since past.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@000A@0014Let me see...@0003
The only real Dragon
we have is Fa right here.@0003
@0008@0010@0104@0012@0017Hi...@0003
@000C@0014@0017This little girl is a Dragon?@0003
@000A@0013Yes, although she is
far from the mature form.@0003
@000C@0012Elder, do you know anything
about the Dragons in Bern?@0003
@000A@0014What!
There are Dragons in Bern?@0003
@000CYes, we have seen them.@0003
@000AWhy...?@0003
Dragons do not exist anywhere
except here.@0003
@0008@0011@0008@0010@011BElder,
if I may.@0003@001C
@000AWhat is it, Igrene?@0003@001C
@0008@0014Sophia said that she could detect an
evil 'force' coming from Bern's troops.@0003
That may have something to do with the
Dragons Roy says he saw at Bern.@0003
@001C
@000A@0013Perhaps...@0003
But I am too old to detect
such force now.@0003@001C
@000C'Force?'
What is that?@0003@001C
@000A@0014Sophia is half dragon, half human.@0003
That gives her the ability to detect
the pulses emitted from other Dragons.@0003
But because she cannot detect them
clearly, she only said that she felt a@0003
Force that was twisted unnaturally.@0003@001C
@0008I think that you should
look into it.@0003
Elder, if you would allow it,
I would like to ask to join@0003
Roy and look into Bern for myself.@0003
@001C
@000AI really do not want to deal
with the matters of the outside...@0003
But this is a time of emergency.
Well then Roy, will you take her?@0003
@001C
@000CCertainly.@0003
@0008I am Igrene,
the Guardian of Nabata.@0003
I have confidence in my skills
with the bow.@0003
I believe I can aid you in@0003
battle as well.@0003
@000CThank you.@0003
@0008@0011@0008@0010@0104@0012@0017Fa's going too!@0003
@000A@0014@0017What are you saying.
Of course you may not.@0003
There is no telling what could
happen if your existence were@0003
exposed to the world!@0003@001C
@0008@0080@000A@0012......@0003@001C
@0008@0011@000A@0011
@000A@0010@011B@0014@000CWell then,
let's go.@0003
@000A@0013Yes.@0003
@000A@0011@000C@0011@0006
@0008@0010@0104...Fine...@0003
Fa will just follow
them anyway!@0003
[0144]
@0008@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0143
@0008@0013@0017General Raeth, about the
girl we captured earlier...@0003
@000C@0014Girl?@0003
The one that was scurrying around
the outskirts of the castle?@0003
Are you still worrying about
that thing?@0003
@000C@0080@000DJust throw her out.@0003
@0008@0013But sir,
she was carrying this.@0003
@0008@0080@000C@000B?
Is this... a Dragon Stone?@0003
@000A@0014... That is what I thought also,
so I decided to report.@0003
@000BHave you ever seen
a Dragon Stone before?@0003
@000AYes,
when we invaded Lycia.@0003
The Mamkutes were carrying them
when they were in human form.@0003
@000B... But it looks different from
the ones that they held.@0003
Well anyway, it still has to
do with the Dragons.@0003
I suppose we should inform
King Zephiel about it and@0003
follow his instructions.@0003
Make sure that the girl@0003
stays inside the castle!@0003
[0145]
@000B@0010@0102@0017Fa has been taken to
that castle over there?@0003@001C
@000D@0010@0154@0013Yes.
The locals have witnessed it.@0003@0011@001C
@0009@0010@011BRoy, I am truly sorry...
One of my people has caused you@0003
great inconvenience, when we must
be hurrying toward Aquleia.@0003
@000B@0014No, please don't worry about it.
If she falls into the hands of Bern,@0003
that in itself would be a disaster.@0003
@0009I believe she would be safe as long
as she remains in human form and@0003
doesn't show anyone her Dragon Stone.@0003
@000BDragon Stone?@0003
@0009Yes, when Dragons are in their human@0003
form, they seal their powers into
crystals called Dragon Stones.@0003
In this world, it is said that
Dragons must use vast amounts of@0003
energy to maintain their actual
form, so they usually remain in@0003
human form to minimize energy consumption.@0003
@000BMaybe the 'humans not human' in Bern
were in human form for the same reason.@0003
@0009By listening to the story you told
us earlier, probably you are right.@0003
It is also said that Dragons started
taking human form ever since the end@0003
of the Scouring.@0003
@000BThat long ago...@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
@0009@0011@0009@0010@0154@0014Master Roy,@0003
the spy we sent to the
castle has returned.@0003
@000BWhat did you find out?@0003
@0009It seems that a lot of soldiers
have been coming out of the castle.@0003
They seem to be fortifying the
defenses around it.@0003
@000BOh...
Maybe they found out Fa was a dragon.@0003
@0009And the troops protecting the border
seem to have noticed us.@0003
@000BWe have to rescue her quickly.@0003
[0146]
@000C@0010@011A@0009@0010@010A
@0009@0017Percival,
you must not force yourself.@0003
@000CLord Douglas, please do not worry about me.
You must return to King Mordred's side.@0003
@0009Getting rid of the
Lycia Alliance Army...@0003
That is a job that requires the
Knight General's assistance.@0003
But still you were sent...
Roartz, that snake.@0003
@000CHe must be wary of my
turning against him.@0003
He must be thinking that if I
were stationed at Aquleia, I would@0003
murder him in his sleep.@0003
@0009That man, worrying about traitors?
Ha!@0003
Why, he was the first to
betray his loyalty to the king!@0003
The dastard.@0003
@000CWell, Lord Douglas, it just goes to show
that not many have such loyalty as you.@0003
@0009Rubbish.
Look at yourself.@0003
@000C... When Prince Mildain was still
alive, I had no hesitations.@0003
I believed that I would dedicate
my life to him and the wellbeing@0003
of Etruria.@0003
And this mission...
It is to protect the king's life.@0003
That should be enough reason to
fight.@0003
@0009Do you hesitate now?@0003
@000CYes, slightly.@0003
But it matters not.
Nothing will change if I do.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
Percival, my speech from this point is
merely to myself. Do not reply to it.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Etruria...@0003
will most certainly fall with
the king before this war ends.@0003
@000C!!
Lord Douglas!?@0003
@0009Listen!@0003
No matter what happens,
I will stay by the king's side.@0003
But you, Percival, you are
different.@0003
You are the one who will lead
tomorrow's Etruria.@0003
I cannot say when, but I
firmly believe that Etruria@0003
will be blessed with prosperity
once more.@0003
So, Percival, you must leave
Etruria and wait until that@0003
time comes.@0003
@000C@0080@000DLord Douglas!
What does...@0003
 @000D@0010@01D7General Percival!@0003
We have confirmed the
Lycia Alliance Army up ahead!@0003
What are your orders, sir!@0003
@0009Now go!
I will return to Aquleia now.@0003@0011
@000B... Move forth!
Pursue the Lycia Alliance Army!@0003
[0147]
@0009@0010@0150@000C@0010@0117@0013@0017This is gonna be a battlefield too...@0003
@0009So what do we do, Boss?@0003
@000C@0014The army's gonna loot the villages anyway.
'Suppose we better ransack em' first.@0003@0009@0012Awright, Boss!@0003
@000C@0014But make sure you don't do any
unnecessary killing, you got that?@0003
@0009@0012Got it...@0003@000C@0011@0006
@0009@0014That guy's too nice...@0003
Well, I guess we can
make it the army's fault.@0003
[0148]
@000C@0010@0143@0009@0010@01D7
@0009General Raeth,
the reinforcements are ready!@0003
@000CGood. Send them out.@0003
@0009Yes sir.@0003
[0149]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@012B
@000CPercival.
It is good to see you.@0003
@0009@0017!!@0005
You...@0003
@000C@0017Have you forgotten my face?@0003
@0009@0017No...it cannot be.
The prince...is dead.@0003
@000C@0017...I understand your confusion.@0003
After all, a man who was pronounced
dead is standing before your very@0003
eyes.@0003
@0009@0017Prince Mildain!@0003
You were alive...?@0003
@000C@0017I have troubled you for a long
time now.@0003
...It has been over a year since I
was assassinated.@0003
@0009@0017Assassinated!?@0003
Your Highness, did you not fall
off your horse in accident?@0003
@000CNo.
I was shot with a poisoned arrow.@0003
First to my horse...and then to
me...@0003
@0009No...@0003
@000CDouglas noticed first and made it
public that I had been killed.@0003
A different corpse was placed in
coffin, and everything was set up@0003
as if the assassination had been
successful.@0003
Douglas then entrusted me to his
adopted daughter and let me escape@0003
to the Western Isles.@0003
@0009Lord Douglas did that...@0003
@000CEven after I escaped to the west,
I suffered from a high fever@0003
caused by the poison for many
months.@0003
I was hovering so long between
life and death that Douglas'@0003
daughter gave up hope countless@0003
times.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CThe resistance forces helped me by
giving me medicine.@0003
Ironic, is it not?@0003
They, who were fighting against
Etrurian nobility, had saved the@0003
life of the Etrurian Prince!@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CI recovered... slowly.@0003
And then I saw the horrors being
committed by the Etrurian nobles@0003
in the area.@0003
I felt ashamed that I had not
noticed when I was still residing@0003
on the throne.@0003
@0009Your Highness...@0003
@000CWhile aiding the resistance forces, I
was looking for a chance to return to@0003
the mainland.@0003
Then Roy came along, and I saw my
chance.@0003
And that is how I ended up here.@0003
@0009@0017Prince...@0003
I am truly thankful that
you have returned alive.@0003
@000C@0017I am with the Lycia Alliance Army
right now, but I must still hide my@0003
identity.@0003
And if I still have the loyalty
you pledged to me in the past...@0003
@0009@0017I am at your service,
my Prince.@0003
My master is only one, and he
is you, Prince Mildain.@0003
[014A]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@0126
@000CSir Percival!@0003
It is you, isn't it?
I was looking for you!@0003
I am...@0003
@000C@0011@000C@0010@0126
@0017Wait! Wait!
Stop your horse!@0003
Listen to me!@0003
@0009...Who are you?@0003
@000CDon't you know!?
I thought we met before.@0003
@0009...I sort of recall seeing you
at Douglas's manor.@0003
@000C@0017Yes!
That's me.@0003
You do know me, then!@0003
@0009@0017But the girl I saw there was
a little more...ordinary.@0003
@000CWhat's that supposed to mean?
Ah, no matter.@0003
Anyway, my name@0017 is Lalum.@0003
I'm here under the command
of Prince Mildain.@0003
@0009@0017Prince Mildain...?
Don't be daft.@0003
The prince was killed in
an accident the year before.@0003
@000C@0017Well...
Look at this!@0003
@0009@0017!!@0003
That emblem...
belongs to the prince...!@0003
@000C@0017Now do I have your attention?@0003
Then look at this letter too,
the prince told me to give it@0003
to you.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
It is the prince's handwriting...@0016
So he was alive!@0003
Then I hesitate no more.@0003
If the Prince is in the Lycia
Alliance Army, then I must do@0003
the same.@0003
@0011@0006
@000C@0017Wha-?
That was quick...@0003
I was hoping things to get more
dramatic...@0003
Like,@0003
'If you would still fight us, then
you would have to cut me down first!'@0003
Or something like that...@0003
[014B]
@0009@0010@0117@000C@0010@0122
@000C@0012@0017Wait!@0003
@0009@0013What?
Who are you?@0003
@000C@0014Why?
Why do you attack the villages?@0003
@0009Eh?
Who do you think you are?@0003
@000CTell me your reason
for attacking the villages!@0003
@0009Reason? ...@0003
Well, I guess I could say
that it's your fault.@0003
@000COur fault?@0003
@0009Yup.@0003
Because you idiots are causing wars
like this, there are more and more@0003
people like me who have to do
banditry to get food.@0003
@000CWe are fighting to help
people like that.@0003
@0009Right, I've heard that enough
times now.@0003
Look at reality, kid.@0003
They all say they're trying
to help, but it's all words@0003
and empty promises.@0003
Where's the action?@0003
You got your head in the clouds, you
can't see what goes on the ground.@0003
Get it?
Now get out of my way.@0003
@000C@0012...No.@0003
@0009@0014What!?@0003
Listen, I ain't playing
games with you.@0003
If you don't get the@0003
hell out of here...@0003
@000CI won't move.@0003
If you want to kill me,
then you may do as you wish.@0003
@0009@0012What...@0003
@000C@0014If I let you pass, I would just
be another one of those people who@0003
you say are all talk and no action.
I am telling the truth!@0003
We are fighting to help the people.@0003
@0009@0012You... Hehe...@0003@0002
@0017I never thought I'd meet anyone
so naive to think as you do.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Do you...
laugh at us...?@0003
@0009@0014@0017But still, it's nice to hear@0003
once in a while.@0003
@000C@0013@0016!
@0016@0017Then...@0003
@0009@0014@0017All right, you win.
I'll stop looting.@0003
But you gotta let me
fight with you guys.@0003
I gotta see with my own
eyes that you're@0003
true to your words.@0003

@000CThank you.@0003
If you fight alongside us,
I'm sure you will understand.@0003
@0009Well, you certainly seem
confident about that.@0003
I'm Garret.
And you're...?@0003
@000CLilina.@0003
@0009Lilina?@0003
Well then, I'm pleased to make
your acquaintance, milady.@0003
[014C]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@0102
@000CGeneral Percival!@0003
@0009@0017General Roy.@0003
I wish to join your cause.
Would it be all right?@0003
@000C@0017Of course!@0003
Someone of your ability
would always be welcome.@0003
But why have you suddenly
@0017changed your mind?@0003
@0009...Must I answer
that question?@0003
@000C@0017No, I wouldn't force you
if you have a reason not to.@0003
@0009@0017Forgive me.@0003
I shall tell you
when the time comes.@0003
[014D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015F
@0017The little girl that was running
around here...@0003
She got taken away to
the castle.@0003
Here, I'll give you this,
so you can rescue her?@0003
It was a book that our priest
was always carrying.@0003
... He got taken away to the castle, too.
But he never returned.@0003
[014E]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0160
This is the Hammerne staff.
It can repair your weapons, spell books,@0003
and staves. But there's one thing
it can't repair,@0003
and that's itself.@0003
@0002
It can repair anything...@0003
But the staff itself
just rots away.@0003
[014F]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015E
I've been hearing about
bandits in these areas.@0003
Sigh... They must be brutal
and savage killers.@0003
[0150]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0161
The rumors say that the Three
Etrurian Generals have become divided..@0003
but so have the people's
hearts. I can only hope they@0003
don't start fighting each other...@0003
[0151]
@0010@0143@0017Gah...!
Hmm...@0003
There must be a reason you
attack this castle...@0003
But what...?@0003
[0152]
@0010@0143
@0017Gah...!
That girl...
She isn't human, is she!@0003
Why... do you seek her...!
To use her power...? ...!@0003
[0153]
@0008@0010@0154@0013@0017Master Roy!
Here she is!@0003
@000CYou found her?
Wait, I'm coming.@0003
@000C@0010@0102
@0008@0014Now young lady,
thank Master Roy.@0003@0080@0004
@000A@0010@0104@0013... Sniff...@0003
@000CIt's ok, Merlinus.@0003@0008@0011
@000C@0014... Now, why did you follow us?@0003
@000A@0013Fa just wanted to
see the outside world...@0003@001C
@0008@0010@0154@0014What!
For such a reason...@0003
Do you know how much
confusion you have caused?@0003@001C
@000A@0080@000CBut... but...
@0080@000CFa's never, ever allowed outside!@0003
The elders say that Fa has to
be hidden...@0003
Fa is always all alone...
all locked up in her room...@0003
@000C@0016@0012......@0003@001C
@0008@0016@0013Master Roy,
what shall we do?@0003@001C
@000C@0014... You've suffered a lot.@0003
But do you understand that you've
worried the elders and caused@0003
a lot of inconvenience?@0003
@000A@0013Fa's sorry...@0003
@000C@0014Really sorry?@0003
@000AYes.@0003
@000C@0017Well then,
you can come with us.@0003
@000A@0080@000C@0012Really!?@0003@001C
@0008@0013@0017Are you sure?@0003@001C
@000C@0014The enemy might already know
about her.@0003
In that case, it's better
to have her where we can see@0003
her rather than letting her go
off back on her own to Arcadia.@0003
@000A@0080@000C@0080@000C@0013@0017Yay!@0003
@0008Hush!
Don't get too excited.@0003
@000CBut you mustn't go off
alone anymore.@0003
Promise?@0003
@000A@0080@000C@0013Yes!
Fa promises!@0003
[0154]

[0155]

[0156]
@0009@0010@0142@0017
Damn...!@0003
That Lycia Alliance Army still
stands!@0003
How could they come this far!?@0003
@000B@0010@01D7G-General Narshen...@0003
The leader of the Three Dragon Lords,
Lord Murdock, is here!@0003
@0009What?!
H-Hurry!@0003
Send someone out to escort him here!
Make sure he gets utmost attention...@0003
@000BHe is already here..@0003
@000D@0010@0147Enough.
Step aside.@000B@0011@0003
@0009@0017L-Lord Murdock...
What a pleasant surprise!@0003
What brings you all the
way from Ilia?@0003
@000D@0080@000E@0017Narshen, I believe you
owe me an explanation.@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0012@0017I-I'm sorry sir...@0003
I don't quite understand...@0003
@000C@0014@0017Princess Guinevere has escaped, again.@0003
Flaer, your lieutenant, has failed
in his mission at the Western Isles.@0003
Also, you have neglected the mission
of capturing the hidden village in@0003
Nabata as given from the king himself!@0003
Narshen!@0003
I want explanations.
Now!@0003
@0008@0013Y-Yes...@0003
Well you see, my Lord, there have
been many complications, and..@0003
@000C... Enough.
I have orders from the king.@0003
You are to be demoted from Dragon
Lord status.@0003
@0008What?!@0003
@000CHis Majesty wants Gale
to take your place.@0003
@0008@0080@000BMy Lord!
Please wait!@0003
Please give me one more chance!!@0003
@000C... The Lycia Alliance Army is
approaching here.@0003
Show me your worth, and stop
them.@0003
If you succeed, I will negotiate
with the king.@0003
@0009Lord Murdock...@0003
@000C@0013Narshen...@0003
Don't fail the king..
or me, again.@0003
[0157]
@000D@0010@0142@0017Rubbish!
Me, demoted?!@0003
And my replacement is that Gale...!@0003
Never!@0003
I will not allow that to happen!@0003
B-But what can I do...
No...!@0003
My honor, my status...
It's all collapsing!@0003
@0008@0010@01D7@0013General Narshen,
the enemy is getting close...@0003
@000D@0080@000E@0013Quiet!
I know that.@0003
@0014@0017... Wait.@0003
Miledy's younger brother is
stationed in this castle...@0003
and she's the one who let
the princess escape!@0003
Ah!@0003
I can say we failed because he
was leaking information to the@0003
enemy and get rid of him later!@0003
Hehehehe...@0003
@0008@0013@0017General Narshen...
What were you thinking?@0003
@000C@0014@0017Hm?@0003
Oh, you know Miledy's
younger brother, don't you?@0003
@0008@0013@0017Do you mean Sir Zeiss?@0003
@000C@0014@0017Right, Zeiss.@0003
Anyway, he's suspected of
@0017leaking information to@0003
the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
Capture him and bring
him here.@0003
@0008@0013What?@0003
But Sir Zeiss would never
do something like that...@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0014Shut up!@0003
All you must do is
follow my orders!@0003
Now bring him here!@0003
[0158]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017Master Roy,@0003
this is the palace of Aquleia.@0003
According to the information we
have gathered, the Coup d'etat@0003
forces are stationed inside.@0003
@000CBishop Yodel,
I thank you for your help.@0003
Thanks to the Elimine Church, we were
able to avoid fighting in the city@0003
and killing innocent people.@0003
@0009No,
I must thank you.@0003
Our order was being prejudiced
by the Coup d'etat group, so if@0003
you hadn't come along to fight,
we would have been driven out of@0003
the land a long time ago.@0003
@000CPrejudiced?
Why?@0003
@0009Most likely because we were
investigating Bern's Dragons.@0003
Saint Elimine, our founder, said@0003
this before she ascended to heaven,
"Never allow the Dragons to@0003
be brought back to the world...
It would mean death for many@0003
people."@0003
Therefore, we are making our best
efforts to find a way to@0003
send the Dragons back to the
world in which they belong.@0003
@000C...If the Coup d'etat forces had
joined with Bern, then of course@0003
they would want to stop you.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
@0014We also found
out this.@0003
The resurrection of the Dragons
is somehow tied to the Fire Emblem,@0003
Bern's greatest treasure.@0003
That's where I sent Saul
and Dorothy to investigate.@0003
@000CI see.@0003
@0009Master Roy, you must stop the
Coup d'etat troops.@0003
And if you would allow me to
give you further advice,@0003@001C
I would suggest that you do
not do any unnecessary killing.@0003
I am sure there are troops that
had no choice but to join the@0003
coup d'etat due to inner reasons.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
@0009May Saint Elimine bless you,
Master Roy.@0003
[0159]
@000B@0010@0146@0080@000D@0017T-The enemy is right
at our doorstep!@0003
@000A@0010@013DOh... what must we do!@0003
If we get caught, we shall
be prosecuted as the initiators@0003
of the coup d'etat!@0003
@000B@0011@000A@0011
@000D@0010@010A@0016@0012......@0003@0011
@000A@0010@013D@000B@0010@0146
@000A@0080@000C@0016@0014... Arcard!
This is all your fault!@0003
If you had done your duty and
gotten rid of the Lycia Alliance@0003
Army at the Western Isles...@0003
@000B@0080@000DB-But Lord Roartz...!
...No!@0003
This is not the time
to be arguing, my Lord!@0003
We must escape!@0003
@000A@0013But escape to where...@0003
@000B@0080@000D... Let us turn to Bern!@0003
This is originally
their plan...@0003
@000A@0014Y-Yes, of course!@0003
We have done what they
asked of us.@0003
They would be sure to
help us.@0003
@000B@0011@000D@0010@010A@0013... May I ask what you intend
to do with the king?@0003
@000A@0014Er... No, they would
not harm the king.@0003
After all, King Zephiel's
mother was from Etruria.@0003
Anyway, Douglas, you must
escape too...@0003
@000DI refuse.@0003
I was originally fighting alongside
you because King Mordred's safety@0003
was at stake.@0003
I had no intention of going along
with your plans.@0003
@000A@0080@000C@0013Hmph!
Stubborn as always, I see.@0003
Suit yourself.
Arcard, let us escape!@0003
@0011
@000B@0010@0146Lord Roartz!
Please wait...@0003@0011@0006
[015A]
@000D@0010@010A@0017...
Dirty traitors!@0003
@0017Fleeing at the last
minute...@0003
@0017It must have been easy
for Bern to seduce them.@0003
I suppose I can leave those two
to the Lycia Alliance Army...@0003
If Prince Mildain returns...@0003
Etruria will pull itself together
again.@0003
And until then... I shall fight
and prove my loyalty as the@0003
'Great General 'of Etruria!@0003
[015B]

[015C]
@000C@0010@0136@0017Zeiss.
Where are you?@0003
[015D]
@000C@0010@0136@0009@0010@012A@0014Yes, I'm here, Sir Gale.
Is something wrong?@0003
Why did you summon me here...@0003
@000C@0017There is no time to be
explaining the details.@0003
Zeiss, you must hide for now.@0003
@0009... What do you mean?
The enemy is right in front of us!@0003
@000CZeiss,
listen to me.@0003
Just now, General Narshen gave an
order to the entire army...@0003
to capture you.@0003
@0009@0013What?!@0003
Does he think that
I am betraying Bern?!@0003
@000C@0014He is trying to put the
responsibility of his past failures@0003
on your shoulders.@0003
He is saying that you worked
with Miledy to leak information@0003
to the enemy.@0003
@0009With my sister?
We don't even know where she is.@0003
@000C@0013Miledy has apparently joined
the Lycia Alliance Army alongside@0003
the Princess.@0003
@0009@0014!!@0003
Miledy turned to the enemy?!
I don't believe it...@0003
@000CThen get the story from
her yourself.@0003
I want to go with you as well,
but I have been told by@0003
Lord Murdock to watch the battle
and report back to him.@0003
Zeiss, I want you to escape when
you see the chance and go speak@0003
with your sister.@0003
@0009@0013Sir Gale!
I...@0003
@000C@0014I do not intend on doing anything
until we hear Miledy's story.@0003@0011
[015E]
@0009@0010@012A@0016@0012......@0003
[015F]
@000C@0010@0123@0017What the?
The Etrurian nobles have ran off?@0003
Wait a minute, then what
happens to my payment?@0003
I haven't been paid for this
mission yet!@0003
[0160]
@000C@0010@012CThe treasures are calling
me!@0003
So this is the palace of the
richest family in Elibe...@0003
The treasure must be something
indeed.@0003
Well, they took it all from us
in the first place, so I'll@0003
only be taking it back!@0003
[0161]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102
@0009Hey you!
You're the leader of the army@0003
that's attacking the
castle, right?@0003
Do you have a shortage
in magicians?@0003
@000C@0017? Well, I guess we could
always use more...@0003
@0009@0017Really? Great!@0003
You see, there's a Mage willing@0003
to fight for you. You think you
would want to hire him?@0003
@000C@0012@0017Where is he?@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0013@0017Right in front of you!@0003
@000C@0016@0012......@0003
@000A@0016@0013Hey, don't look at me
like that!@0003
I'm pretty decent with
my magic.@0003
You can hire me for
10000 gold!@0003
@000C@001710000!
That's expensive...@0003
@000A@0017Come on!@0003
I need money for my
grandma...@0003
@000C@0017What?@0003
Is your grandmother sick
or something?@0003
@000A@0080@000B@0014@0017Er... R-Right!
Something to that nature..@0003
Anyway, I need some cash.
Come on, pal!@0003
[0162]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102
@0013@0017All right, if your grandmother's
sick, then I suppose@0003
you need money for medicine...@0003

[0163]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102
@0017Well...
@0018
[0164]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0080@000D@0017All right, if your grandmother's
sick, then I suppose@0003
you need money for medicine..@0003
@0009You got that right!
She's really sick, you know.@0003
She's always getting these really
bad headaches around her back..@0003
@000B@0013Huh?@0003
Headaches around her back?@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0017Um, y-you know what I mean,@0003
I was just giving an example@0003
of the pain...
... O-okay, got the money.@0003
I'll do my job well.
You can count on me!@0003
@0011
@000B@0016@0012......@0003
[0165]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102
@0017I'm sorry, but I can't pay
10000 gold for just one person.@0003
@0009@0013What!@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0014.. W-Well,
I could compensate with 8000...@0003
@000C@0012?...@0003
@000A@0080@000C@0013@0017Come on, please?@0003
[0166]
@000A@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102@000C@0013@0017I'm sorry, but...@0003
@000A@0014S-Still no good?@0003
Um... well, I guess 6000 would
Still do...@0003
@000C@0012Er...@0003
@000A@0080@000C@0013Please.
I really need the money...@0003
[0167]
@000A@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0016@0012......@0003
@000A@0016@0014@0017......@0003
@0080@000CAll right, all right!
I'm really getting desperate
Now... 5000! How's that!@0003
@000C@0016@0012.........@0003
@000A@0080@000C@0016@0013Come on, I'm begging you!
Please hire me!@0003
[0168]
@000A@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0080@000F@0017I'm sorry.@0003
@000A@0013No...@0003
... Please... I swear I'll be
really useful..@0003
@000D@0014The money we have belongs
to all of us.@0003
I have no right to use it on
my own judgment.@000AArgh! I give up! Fine!@0003
@000A@0080@000BHave it your way.@0003
Just when I thought you were
somebody... Ha!@0003
You've got some pretty 'nice'
beliefs, haven't you, kid!@0011
@000D@0016@0012......@0003
[0169]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0134
@0009@0012@0017Cecilia.@0003
@000C@0014Lord Douglas...@0003
Why is someone of your stature
fighting for the Coup d'etat@0003
forces...?@0003
@0009@0013I am prioritizing
the king's safety.@0003

That is all.@0003
@000C@0014But if this continues, Etruria
will become a puppet state for Bern!@0003
There must be a nation for there
to be a king.@0003
If the nation falls, so will its
power.@0003
And in the end, all will be
forgotten!@0003
@0009If this nation is doomed to
collapse, so be it.@0003
But I will assure the
king's safety!@0003
@000CWhat...!@0003
We must fight for the people,
for our nation!@0003
The Etrurian army is for the
people.@0003
They are not the king's
private soldiers!@0003
@0009...
It is a matter of opinion.@0003
Cecilia, you must follow your
beliefs, as I must follow mine.@0003

[016A]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@010D
@000C@0013@0017Lord Douglas...@0003
@0009Klein.
I knew you since you were a child.@0003
I never expected we would be
fighting like this.@0003
@000C@0014Lord Douglas,
please reconsider!@0003
You are the 'Great General',
the highest of all our ranks!@0003
Why are you bringing yourself@0003
down with those traitors...!@0003
@0009... Klein.
I am a General.@0003
@000C@0012What...?@0003
@0009@0014Our king has been captured by Bern.@0003
I cannot cast away my loyalty
and turn to the enemy side.@0003
@000C@0012But...@0003
@0009@0014... There are so many people these
days who cast away their honor@0003
for money and power.@0003
I will not do the same.
My loyalty to the king will@0003
not sway.@0003
@000C@0016@0012......@0003
@0009@0016@0014My time is over.@0003
The Etrurian Army is up to your
generation now.@0003
I only ask of you to lead it as
our ancestors did.@0003
@000C@0013Lord Douglas...@0003
@0009@0014... Now go.@0003
[016B]
@0009@0010@012A@000C@0010@012E
@0009@0012@0017Miledy!!@0003
@000C@0013Zeiss?!
What are you doing here?@0003
@0009@0014... I'm being accused of
betraying Bern.@0003
@000C@0013Oh...!
Is it... my fault...?@0003
@0009@0014Sir Gale said that you had joined
the enemy.@0003
But I couldn't believe it until now,
when I can see it with my own eyes!@0003
Why!
Why did you betray Bern?@0003
@000CI never betrayed Bern.
I just wanted to help Princess Guinevere.@0003
@0009So you threw away everything...
Your homeland, your family...@0003
Even your lover...
for the princess.@0003
For that... stubborn princess who
betrayed her own brother!@0003
@000CEnough, Zeiss!@0003
I will not tolerate you
insulting Princess Guinevere!@0003
@0009@0016@0012......@0003
@000C@0016@0014It is the princess, not the king,
who is truly working for the good@0003
of Bern.@0003
Granted, I was angry when the
princess left without consulting@0003
me at all.@0003
But now that I am at her side,
I understand more than ever..@0003
That she had not made a mistake.@0003
@0009@0013... Sir Gale was right.@0003
@000C@0012What? Gale?@0003
@0009@0014He said that he didn't intend
on doing anything until@0003
he heard your story.@0003
@000C@0013Gale said that...@0003
@0009@0014@0017I don't fully agree with you yet,
but.. I know I can trust you.@0003
@000C@0013Zeiss!
Then...?@0003
@0009@0014If the Lycia Alliance Army's
leader would allow it,@0003
I want to go with you.
I want to see the princess's@0003
beliefs that moved you so.@0003
[016C]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0126
@000CFather!@0003
@0009@0017Lalum!
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0017I joined the Lycia Alliance
Army with Prince Mildain...@0003
@0009!
So the prince has returned!@0003
Now Etruria has hope...@0003
@000CFather...@0003
@0009@0017Lalum... I'm sorry I put
you through this.@0003
I had to send you off along
to protect the prince.@0003
@000CNo!@0003
That was what
I wanted to do.@0003
@0009... But just when I thought
I had saved you from a hard@0003
life, I had to send you out
to be a dancer again.@0003
@000C... You saved me from that terrible
life with no food... no money...@0003
And you even raised me as your
own daughter...@0003
From that time, I made up my@0003
mind that I would one day
return the gift, and that I@0003
would be of some use to you.@0003
@0009Lalum...@0003
@000C@0017So I'm really...
glad, now.@0003
I'm finally being
useful to you...@0003
@0009Lalum, thank you.@0003
... Please take care of the prince
from now on, as well.@0003
@000C@0017What about you?
You're not coming with us?@0003
@0009King Mordred is still
in the hands of the enemy.@0003
If I turn to the Lycia Alliance Army
now, then the king's life would be@0003
in danger.@0003
@000C... But still..@0003
@0009Now that the prince has returned
safely, I have no regrets,@0003
even if I am to be taken down
by the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Now go.@0003
If you are seen with me, you would
be suspected of treachery.@0003
@0017No matter where you are, you
will always be my true daughter.@0003
Always...@0003
@000C@0017Father...@0003
@0009@0017May your life be blessed
with happiness...@0003
[016D]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@012B
@000C@0017Douglas!@0003
@0009@0017Prince Mildain!
You are back!@0003
You seem so well now...
Thank goodness.@0003
@000C@0017It is all thanks to you.
I am sorry I put you through this.@0003
@0009@0017You returned safely...
That is more than enough praise.@0003
@000C@0017Douglas, I am currently working
with the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@0009@0017Is that so!@0003
Then everything will go smoothly
as long as we drive off Bern's@0003
troops from the palace.@0003
@000C@0017What are you going to do?@0003
@0009The king is still in enemy hands...@0003
If I turn against Bern now, the King
would be in danger.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009But now that you have returned,
I have no more regrets, even@0003
if I were to be defeated by
the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@000CDouglas...
I apologize.@0003
You are doing all of this
for my father...@0003
@0009@0017My Prince, if my life were to
be used for the true benefit@0003
of Etruria, then that would be my
last wish.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009I am glad that I could  see
you alive before my death.@0003
@000C@0017You risked your life to
protect me and let me escape@0003
to the Western Isles.
I shall never forget that.@0003
... Never.@0003
@0009... I still have false hope.@0003
I still think of trying to
take you to see the king..@0003
@000C... Douglas, I will not
give up hope.@0003
Roy... he just might
be able to...@0003
[016E]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@011A
@000C@0017Lord Douglas!@0003
@0009Percival...@0003
I see no more hesitation
in your eyes now.@0003
@000CLord Douglas, it is thanks to you.@0003
Because you saved Prince Mildain,
I was able to return to being an@0003
honorable knight again.@0003
@0009Good.@0003
@000CWhat are you going
to do, Lord Douglas?@0003
@0009The king is still in the
hands of the enemy.@0003
If I turn to the Lycia Alliance
Army now, then the king's life@0003
would be in danger.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Now that the prince has returned,
I have no regrets, even if I am to@0003
be taken down by the Lycia Alliance Army.
@000CI knew you would say
that, my Lord.@0003
@0009Well, you have walked the same
path as I.@0003
Please take care of the prince...
And Etruria.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
I shall dedicate my life to them.@0003

[016F]
@0010@0142
@0017I am strong...
I am wise...@0003@0005
I am handsome...
And I am right!@0003@0002
Always!
More than anybody!@0003

[0170]
@0010@0142
@0017No... No..!!@0003@0002
I will not be defeated..!
Not by you...@0003
Worthless... Gaahh!!!@0003

[0171]
@0008@0010@0159@000B@0010@0102
@0008So it is you...
who rescued us?@0003
@000B@0013@0017My name is Roy, leader of
the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@0008Hm...@0003
@000B@0016......@0016@0003
@0008@0014...I must ask something of you.
Those soldiers who have been@0003
working with Bern have taken
over the Tower of the Saint.@0003
@000BThe Tower of the Saint...@0003
That is where Saint Elimine's
altar lies...@0003
@0008Yes...@0003
That is a national symbol of Etruria.@0003
Please, recapture the tower.@0003
@000BI will do what I can.@0003
@0008@0013I am sorry.@0003
You may use anything in
the tower that you find useful.@0003
@0011@0006
@001C@000D@0010@0154
@001C@000BThe king...
He still mourns the prince.@0003
@001C@000D@0014He must have been
an easy target for Bern.@0003
@001C@000B@0014I want to help him...
but how?@0003@000D@0011@000B@0011@0005
@000C@0010@012BFather...
I am sorry...@0003
When the time comes,
I will return for sure.@0003
[0172]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0157
@000C@0013@0017Princess Guinevere,
I must speak with you.@0003
@0009... Is it that we must attack Bern
as well after Etruria?@0003
@000C!
Did someone inform you?@0003
@0009@0014No.@0003
...But I knew that it would
happen eventually.@0003
@000C... We cannot leave Bern running
around freely any longer.@0003
I am sure that it would be hard
to see your nation invaded, but...@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0013... Roy,
I will give this to you.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0012What is this?@0003
@000A@0013It is Bern's greatest treasure...
the Fire Emblem.@0003
@000B@0012What!?@0003
@000A@0080@000B@0014In the south of Bern lies
a temple called the Cave of Seals.@0003
In it lies the sword that our founder,
Hartmut, used.@0003
@000B@0013Is it...
one of the Divine Weapons?@0003
@0009@0014It is said to be so.@0003
However, the sword was so immensely
powerful because it was made to slay@0003
the 'Dark Dragon', the leader of the
Dragons during the Dragon Human wars.@0003
Therefore, after the war, the sword
was sealed in the cave.@0003
The Fire Emblem is the key to open
the door to it.@0003
@000B@0013The key...@0003
@0009@0014My brother...is trying to force
the world into submission with@0003
military strength.@0003
That is something that is not
forgivable, no matter what the@0003
reason.@0003
@000B@0016@0012......@0003
@0009@0016@0013To stop him, all we can
do is defeat the Dragons@0003
that are by his side.@0003
@000BPrincess Guinevere...@0003
@0009@0080@000A... My name shall be stained in
history, as the one who@0003
betrayed her nation.@0003
@000B@0012No...@0003
@0008@0014I shall be hated all my life
as a traitor.@0003
Roy, promise me one thing.@0003
When we invade Bern, please
do not harm the civilians...@0003
@000BI will not.
Please trust me.@0003
@0008@0013@0017...Thank you.@0003
[0173]
@0009@0010@0136@000C@0010@0147
@000C@0013@0017So,
Narshen has fallen.@0003
@0009@0014Yes.@0003
Lord Murdock, did we really
not have to aid him?@0003
@000CThose were the king's orders.@0003
Besides, the Bern army has no
use for a man who cannot clean@0003
up his own mess.@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@0146@000A@0010@013DLord Murdock...
What will become of us?@0003
@000CLord Arcard, I will entrust this land
of Raemy to you.@0003
Lord Roartz, I will have you take
the land of Edessa.@0003
Please make preparations to retaliate.@0003
@0008What!?
Raemy is right on the border!@0003
The enemy will arrive in no time!@0003
@000CTrue.@0003
But this position also allows us
to easily launch an attack on Etruria.@0003
Make sure this castle does not fall.@0003
@000AEdessa...@0003
It is in the outer wastelands
of Ilia...@0003
@000CYou would have plenty of time to
prepare your defenses, would you not?@0003
@0008... You...
could not take back Etruria for us?@0003
@000CIt is possible.@0003
But when we win, Etruria will
go under Bern's rule.@0003
@000A@0013No!
That will not do.@0003
@000CThen I suggest that you find a way
to deal with the situation yourself.@0003
Excuse us.@0003
@0011@001C
@0009@0012@0016......@0003
[0174]
@0009@0010@0136@000C@0010@0147
@0009@0017My Lord, were we really supposed
to dispose of those two like that?@0003
@000CDon't worry.@0003
Bern's code says that every
individual must be able to deal with@0003
his own consequences...@0003
The enemy leader, was his name Roy?@0003
@0009@0012Yes.@0003
@000C@0014I must admit, he has done a superb
job rebuilding the Alliance Army even@0003
@0017after we crushed it so...@0003
If I have the chance, I would like to
have the honor of fighting him,@0003
one on one.@0003
[0175]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0013We are soon approaching
the Etrurian Border.@0003
@000C@0014Bishop Yodel,
I thank you for everything.@0003
Thanks to the church, we were
able to proceed thus far with ease.@0003
@0009Please.@0003
If you had not captured Aquleia,
we would be suffering from@0003
prosecution under Bern.@0003
This is nothing in comparison
for what you did for us.@0003
@000C@0013@0017I am glad that I could be
of use to you.@0003@0009@0014Now...
May I ask a very important favor?@0003
@000CYes, anything that
I am capable of.@0003
@0009If you find out anything
else about the Dragons...@0003
@000CI understand.@0003
If I discover anything new,
I will report to you immediately.@0003
@0009@0017Thank you!@0003
...Oh yes, I must tell
@0017you something.@0003
@0009@0014At a certain time of day, the sea level drops,
exposing a sand bar that can be crossed.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0012A sand bar?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
If you were to go all the way
around to attack the castle, it@0003
would take much time.@0003
However, if the sand bar were
crossed, it would not take as long.@0003
@000B@0013I see.@0003
@0009But please be careful.@0003
Rushing is not always the
best tactic to win a war.@0003
@000BYes.
Thank you for your advice.@0003
@0009@0014@0017Of course.@0003
Then, may Saint Elimine
bless the Etrurian Army!@0003
[0176]

[0177]

[0178]

[0179]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0146
@0009@0013@0017Lord Arcard!
A path has appeared in the sea!@0003
@000CWhat!?@0003
@0009@0014Well... according to the locals, the
tide pulls out at this time of day...@0003
@000C@0080@000D@000BWhat!
You didn't know about this!@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0008But sir, we are not from these parts!
We are not familiar with the geography@0003
of this land!@0003
@000B@0080@000D@0013Damn!
Charge!@0003
Prevent the enemy
from crossing that path!@0003
[017A]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0013@0017Master Roy,
we have a report.@0003
@000C@0012Did the path in the sea appear?@0003
@0009@0013Yes.@0003
Bishop Yodel was
right about this.@0003
@000CDid the enemy
know about this?@0003
@0009@0014Actually,
they seem to be in a panicked state.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0013All right, then let's not
miss this chance!@0003
Charge!@0003
[017B]

[017C]

[017D]

[017E]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0192
Ah, are you fighting against Bern?
Then please take this staff.@0003
It was once used by a noble
princess...@0003
[017F]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018D
Did you know that at a certain
time of day, a sand bar appears@0003
in the bay?
We call it the@0003
Path Through the Ocean.
Good Luck!@0003
[0180]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0193
The tide action is pretty
drastic around here.@0003
I remember a time when I
was getting ready to go fishing,@0003
but by the time my boat was ready,
the tide had already gone out.@0003
[0181]
@0010@0146@0017W-Why!
Why is this happening to me!?@0003
[0182]
@0010@0146@0017I...
am an Etrurian...@0003@0002
noble!@0003
I must not...die...
here... Guh!@0003
[0183]
@000D@0010@0154@000B@0010@0102
@000D@001C@0017Lord Arcard...@0003
What a pathetic ending for
one who became so powerful.@0003
@000B@001CWell, last year I didn't think
I would be doing this either.@0003
Maybe fate can turn out in the
most unlikely way...@0003
And that might be true for
Bern, too.@0003
@000D@0011@0009@0010@0154...? Master Roy, what is that
you are holding in your hand?@0003
@000BOh, this?
This is the Fire Emblem.@0003
@0009Oh...
So this tiny gem is...@0003
@000BPrincess Guinevere wanted me
to keep it.@0003
It seemed... difficult for her
to give it to me...@0003
She must have been hoping to
end the war peacefully until@0003
there was no hope left...@0003
@0009Hm...@0003
Trust between siblings?
It didn't seem likely on the outside.@0003
@000B@0012Why not?@0003
@0009@0014Because the enemy is Zephiel,
the king of Bern!@0003
It is said that he murdered his own
father, so I didn't think that he@0003
would be moved by family trust...@0003
@000B@0080@000E@0013What!?
He killed his own father?@0003
@0009@0014Didn't you know, Master Roy?@0003
Zephiel took the throne because the
former king had died.@0003
But because the former king's death
had been so sudden, there are many@0003
rumors going around.@0003
@000C@0013And one of
them is...@0003
@0009@0014... That Zephiel assassinated him.@0003
@000C... Does Princess Guinevere know
about this?@0003
@0009She must know something about it,
if not all.@0003
@000C@0012@0016......@0003
[0184]
@000C@0010@01D4@0008@0010@01D7
@0008@0017Bishop Martel!@0003
We have brought the lady Niime,
as you asked.@0003
@000C@0012Good.
Let her pass.@0003@0008@0011@0005
@0009@0010@0124@0013What do you want from me?@0003
@000C@0014Are you Niime,
the Hermit on the Mountain?@0003
@0009So, some have begun calling me
that, have they?@0003
Then I must be that Niime.@0003
@000CI hear you are capable of using
the ancient spell book that@0003
we found in this castle.@0003
@0009I should be able to.@0003
I have been studying the dark arts and
ancient magic for centuries now.@0003
@000CI understand that this spell can change
the climate and weather around the caster...@0003
@0009@0013It wouldn't be
entirely improbable.@0003
@000C@0014Then I order you.
Use the spell book and create rainfall.@0003
Make it rain so that the rivers will
overflow and push back that Etrurian@0003
Army that is advancing on us.@0003
@0009Well I can try, but frankly I
can't guarantee that it would work.@0003
Also, powerful spells like these can
only be cast once.@0003
Are you sure?@0003
@000C@0080@000DSilence!@0003
All you must do is follow my commands.@0003
You were the one who came to us and said
that you wished to join our forces.@0003
Then make yourself useful.@0003
@0009@0012@0016......@0003 
[0185]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Princess Guinevere...@0003
We are getting closer to
Bern's army.@0003
@0009...Yes.@0003
@000CSince we are getting closer,
we are clashing with soldiers from@0003
Bern more and more often.@0003
It will not be long before we
engage in full combat with Bern.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CI wish to ask you
something before we do.@0003
@0009What is that?@0003
@000CI have been hearing rumors...@0003
That King Zephiel rose to the
throne because he killed his@0003
father, the former king.@0009@0080@000A@0016!@0003
@000C@0016I could not believe it.@0003
You tried to stop him even by
casting away your nationality.@0003
If King Zephiel is such a mad
individual as the rumors say, then@0003
you would not have thought of@0003
doing what you did.@0003
@0008@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Princess Guinevere,@0003
I accepted the Fire Emblem not
to use it in battle, but to try@0003
and find a use for it to end@0003
this war peacefully.@0003
@0008Roy...@0003
@000CTherefore, please tell me
the truth about the rumors...@0003
@0008I... I'm sorry.
Please... give me some time.@0003@0011
@000C@0080@000DPrincess!@0003
@0008@0010@0154@0014... What is the matter?@0003
Princess Guinevere was running off...@0003
@000B@0080@000E... No, it's nothing.
Did you want something?@0003@0080@0004
@0008@0080@000B@0009Yes, I have gathered some information.
We may have some trouble with this battle.@0003
A powerful dark magician by the name
of Niime resides in the enemy ranks.@0003
@000C@0013Dark Magician...
A Druid, probably.@0003
@0009@0014She is apparently extremely learned in
ancient sorcery.@0003
She has much more knowledge than
any scholar could dream about.@0003
@000C@0013But we can't pull back now.@0003
@0009Yes,
but we can always be careful.@0003
@000CI know.
We must be wary!@0003
[0186]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@01D4
@000C@0017Is the spell ready?
Niime!@0003
@0009@0013... I'm warning you for the last time.
I really have no idea what will happen...@0003
@000CJust shut up and cast the spell!@0003
@0009@0014Sigh.... All right...@0003
[0187]
@0008@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0008@0013@0017W-What is going on...?@0003
@000CAn enemy spell caster?
Everyone, watch out!@0003
[0188]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@01D4
@0017What...
What is this!?@0003
The rivers...
The rivers have frozen over!@0003
@0009@0013@0017My, my...
Now isn't this a surprise.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@000B@0017!! You!
You did this on purpose!@0003
@0009@0014What are you talking about... I warned
you I couldn't predict what would happen.@0003
@000CQuiet! Someone!
Throw her into the dungeon!@0003
@0008@0010@01D7@0012Yes sir!@0003
@0009@001CSigh....@0003
[0189]
@000C@0010@0102@0013@0017What... happened?@0003
@0009@0010@0154@0014Master Roy, we have a report.
The rivers have apparently frozen over.@0003
@000C@0012What?@0003
@0009@0014The ice is so thick that knights
on horseback can cross them with safety.@0003
@000C@0013Oh...@0003
Well, good, we can advance more
quickly now.@0003
Charge toward the castle gate!@0003
[018A]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0192
I was told that this Goddess Statue
would bring me good luck...@0003
But I pray to it everyday,
and nothing happens.@0003
That con man tricked me!
Here, take it.@0003
Just looking at it
is making me angry.@0003
[018B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0198
Hey, when I was playing outside,
a ring fell from the sky!@0003
...God gave it to me?
No way! Probably someone@0003
riding on a pegasus or a
wyvern dropped it.@0003
Here, take it.
I prefer my dolls.@0003
[018C]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0194
Are you the Etrurian Army?
Sigh... Just the other day,@0003
Bern's army went marching by.
When will we have peace again?@0003
Here, take this.
Use it to end the war.@0003
[018D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018F
That Martel who's guarding the castle...
He said he had some secret@0003
weapon to use against you guys.
I'd be careful if I were you.@0003
[018E]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0190
When it gets cold enough,
the rivers around all freeze over,@0003
and we can get to the village in
the east without much trouble.@0003
But it's not quite the
season, unfortunately.@0003
[018F]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018D
You seem to be strong.@0003
But I heard that somewhere there's
a man called the 'Sword Saint'@0003
who is unimaginably powerful.
[0190]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0196
@0017Hey, are you the Etrurian Army
that the old lady was talking about?@0003
I heard for some reason, she was
originally planning to join you@0003
guys, but for some reason she
went along with Bern.@0003
What is she thinking?@0003 
[0191]
@0010@01D4
@0017Blast!@0003
How could you have traversed
through this snow...@0003
Curse that useless hag!@0003

[0192]
@0010@01D4
@0017No...@0003
I, one of the most intelligent of
the generals...can die...?@0003
[0193]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0102
@0009Finally I have been released
from the clutches of Bern.@0003
@000C@0017You are?@0003
@0009@0017I am Niime.@0003
I live in the mountains to
study arcane magic.@0003
@000C@0017You say you were released.@0003
Did you not join Bern out of
your own will?@0003
@0009@0017Well I did,
but it was only a guise.@0003
Bern's army had something that I
wanted to study.@0003
@000C@0017What is that?@0003@0080@0004
@0009@0017The Dragons.@0003
@000C@0017!!@0003
@0009@0017Well well, that got you
interested, didn't it?@0003
@000C@0017The Dragons you speak of...@0003
They are not the wyverns that
Bern's Dragon Knights use,@0003
but the strange troops that are
mixed in with Bern's soldiers...@0003
@0009@0017Exactly.@0003
Those are the Dragons that were
supposedly defeated in the@0003
Dragon Human wars.@0003
@000C@0017How do you know this...?@0003
@0009I thought that this was only another
war that Bern started at first.@0003
But then I began to see strange...
evil things among their troops.@0003
So I decided to investigate.@0003
@000CAnd did you find out anything?@0003
@0009The Dragons are indeed shrouded
in mystery.@0003
I looked through many ancient books
and scrolls, but I could only@0003
decipher so many of them.@0003@0005
But...@0003
@000C...But?@0003
@0009I have come to believe that Bern
has resurrected the Dark Dragon.@0003
@000CDark Dragon...@0003
That is the leader of the Dragons
that Hartmut defeated.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
Dragons are simply a much more
advanced species than us humans.@0003
They have much greater vitality and
intellect than us.@0003
However, there was one thing that
the Dragons lagged far behind the@0003
behind the humans in.@0003
The Dragons' reproductive system
was much less efficient than@0003
that of the humans.@0003
But even then, the Dark Dragon...
It had power to create more@0003
more Dragons.@0003
That is what I learned from
my research.@0003
@000CIt can make more Dragons...@0003
@0009The Dark Dragon can create more
of its kind.@0003
That would explain where Bern is
getting all of its Dragons.@0003
@000CThat is possible.@0003
@0009@0017Now, that being said...@0003
I want to learn more about
the Dragons.@0003
Let me accompany your travels.@0003
I wield Dark Magic...@0003
I'm sure I can be of some
assistance.@0003
@000C@0017Of course.@0003
We want to learn about
the Dragons as well.@0003
It may be dangerous,
but if that's okay with you,@0003
you're welcome to join us.@0003
[0194]
@0009@0010@0153@000C@0010@0145
@0009@0017Captain!@0003
The enemy has arrived.@0003
They are on the other side
of the mountain.@0003
@000C@0013@0017So, they've arrived.
It starts.@0003
@0009@0017Captain,
are you sure?@0003
@000C@0012@0017About what?@0003
@0009@0014@0017The Etrurian Army is saying that
they would liberate us from Bern.@0003
In that case, we would gain
independence...@0003
@000CDo you really believe what
they say?@0003
What idiot would fight a war for
the sakes of others?@0003
Once they defeat Bern, they would
station themselves as the next@0003
dictator.@0003
@0009Well...@0003
@000CThen it's better to be with Bern.
They're better at warfare.@0003
@0009@0012@0016......@0003
@000C@0014@0016Come now, we have more
immediate problems.@0003
We've got to get rid of the enemy
that's right in front of us first.@0003
Are the ballistae ready?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
The archers are all at their
stations.@0003
@000C@0017Good!
Shoot at them from a distance.@0003
They'll be floundering around in
the dark in this powerful blizzard.@0003
Observe nature's wrath...@0003
[0195]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Such strong wing and hail...
I can't see 3 meters in front of me.@0003
@0009@0017Ilia's winters are always like this.@0003
Well, you can't complain if you're
fighting a battle in winter.@0003
@000C@0017We must attack now so that Bern
doesn't have the time to recover.@0003
@0009@0013@0017That's true.@0003
It would be a disaster if the Dark Dragon
was really brought back to this world.@0003
@000C@0017I was thinking...@0003
Maybe the Dark Dragon
is in human form as well.@0003
@0009@0017Perhaps.@0003@0002
Maybe all the Dragons are in human
form now.@0003
I've also heard stories of Dragons
in human form living with people.@0003
@000C@0017Nabata...@0003
@0009@0017Hm?
Did you say something?@0003
@000C@0017No, nothing.@0003@0080@0004
@0009I don't know anything specific,
but I have read in an ancient scroll@0003
that Dragons started taking human
form only after the Ending Winter.@0003
@000CThe Ending Winter...@0003
@0009You have heard about it,
have you not?@0003
@000CYes, only in legend.@0003
@000C'At the Winter of Ends, the laws
of nature were turned upside down.@0003
Day became night,
and summer became winter.@0003
@0009That's it.@0003
These scrolls are so old and damaged
so I couldn't decipher all of them,@0003
but one thing is clear.@0003
The Ending Winter was a disaster
powerful enough to bend and twist@0003
the planet.@0003
@000CWhat caused it?@0003
@0009Who knows...@0003
Popular belief says that the laws@0003
of nature were twisted when the
Dragons unleashed vast amounts of@0003
magical power, but I have no idea@0006
what really happened, either.@0003
But it does seem certain that Dragons
started taking human form after the@0003
Ending Winter.@0003
It must be more than coincidence.@0003
@000CYes, I agree.@0003
@0009@0017Well either way,
the truth lies in Bern.@0003
[0196]
@0009@0010@0153@000C@0010@0145
@0009@0017Captain!@0003
Other Pegasus Knight squads
are headed this way to@0003
assist us!@0003
@000CReally?
That would help.@0003
Too bad for the enemy...@0003
They'll be in a panic if they suddenly
get attacked from all directions when@0003
they can't see in this snowstorm...@0003
[0197]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0192
You have come to such an
isolated area like this...?@0003
The prophecies were correct...@0003
The world is covered in darkness...
A single blade of wind will@0003
slice through the darkness
and the light will shine again.@0003
[0198]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018E
I've pondered a lot about whether
I should join Bern...@0003
But I've made up my mind now.
Take this ring.@0003
It brings out your inner powers.@0003
...Please grant this land with peace.@0003
[0199]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018D
Bern's Ilian Headquarters?
Um, I think it was Eda...@0003
Ede... Edessa! That's it.
It's to the northeast.@0003
[019A]
 @0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018F
You know about the ballistae
to the east, right?@0003
We're out of their range here,
but the item shop over there isn't...@0003
[019B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0195
@0017Pegasus Knights and Ballistae...
Captain Sigune is after you.@0003
She's hiding in the
blizzard and waiting...@0003
[019C]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0191
I can only wish you luck.@0003
The 'White Devil' Sigune
is defending this land.@0003
The Ilian Pegasus Knights fly
through the blizzard.@0003
You can't see anything in the blizzard...
and then they suddenly appear out@0003
of the swirling snow. By then
it's too late...@0003
You're already dead...@0003
[019D]
@0010@0145
So... you've made it through
this blizzard and cold?@0003@0002
Congratulations.@0003
But it's not over.
You will die...@0003
Right here, right now.@0003
[019E]
@0010@0145
...Well, well...@0003
So I'm the one...
to die...@0003
But maybe...
I was already dead...@0003
A long time... ago...@0003
[019F]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0154
@000C@0017Merlinus, I need you to send
this letter to Bishop Yodel in Etruria.@0003
@0009A letter?
May I ask what it says?@0003
@000CIt's the story we heard from
Niime about the Dragon.@0003
@0009Oh?@0003
What did you discuss
with her about the Dragon?@0003
@000CIt'll get long if I tell you.@0003
I haven't sealed the letter yet, so
you can look through it if you want.@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0008@0013All right.
Let me see...@0003@0011@0007@0080@0004
@0008@0010@0157......@0003
@000CIs something wrong,
Princess Guinevere?@0003
@0008@0080@000B... I have come to speak
about my brother.@0003
@000C!!
... Is it all right?@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
I wanted you to know before
we enter Bern...@0003
About the tragedies that have
that have occurred.@0003
You asked earlier if my brother
murdered the former king.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009In short...@0005
it is true.@0003
@000C!@0003
Then King Zephiel indeed killed his
own father to seize the throne...@0003
@0009@0080@000CNo!@0003
@000CNo?@0003
He didn't kill his father to
get the throne?@0003
@000ANo...@0003
Our father was the first one who
tried to kill Zephiel.@0003
@000CWhat!
Then King Zephiel...@0003
@000AHe couldn't bear the abuse
he was taking from our father.@0003
And so he...@0003
@000CWhat...
Why did...@0003@0080@0004@0008@0010@0154@0014The Dragons are indeed mysterious
species... Hm?@0003
What is the matter?@0003
@001C
@000A@0013No... It is nothing.
Perhaps later...@0003@0011@0006
@0008@0014... Did I appear at
a bad time?@0003
@000CNo, it's okay.
Did you send the letter?@0003
@0008@0080@000BYes. I read through it,
then sealed it and had it sent.@0003
@000COh... All right, thanks.@0003@0009@0011
@000C... Why did the former king
try to murder his own son...?@0003
[01A0]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@013D@0013Well?
Have we got enough troops?@0003
@0009@0014@0017Well...@0003
We are requesting aid from Ilia's
Knight's but all of them except those@0003
that have direct orders from Lord
Murdock are hesitant to help us.@0003
@000C@0080@000EDamn!
How could this happen...@0003
Ah, we had captured Zealot's wife and
his family.@0003
How about Zealot's group?@0003
Have they responded?@0003
@0009No...@0003
They have been traveling all over the
continent as mercenary knights, so we@0003
do not know their exact location.@0003
@000C@0012@0016Damn...@0003
@0009@0014@0016Ever since Sigune's group was defeated,
all of Ilia's militia have been reluctant@0003
to attack the Etrurian Army.@0003
@000C@0080@000DBlast!
Everyone, everyone is such a coward!@0003
They would have me, advisor to the
Etrurian court, die in a place@0003
like this!?@0003
[01A1]
@0009@0010@0194@0012@0017Cough...cough...@0003
@000C@0010@0127@0014Are you all right?
Here, take my shawl.@0003
@0009@0013N-No,
then you would be cold...@0003
@000C@0014@0017It's all right,
I'm used to the cold.@0003
It's far better than flying through
the blizzards on a pegasus.@0003
@0009@0013... Thank you.
Cough...cough...@0003@0011@0005
@0009@0010@0191@0017Lady Yuno...
What will become of us?@0003
@000C@0014@0017... I don't know.
But we must have hope.@0003
Perhaps the enemy might leave,
or perhaps Zealot might return.@0003
We must have hope.@0003
@0009@0013@0017... Where is Lord Zealot now?@0003
@000C@0014In his last letter, he said that he
would be joining the Lycia Alliance@0003
@0017Army, but after that...@0003
Well, he could be closer than
we think he is.@0003
@0009@0013@0017I hope you're right.@0003
[01A2]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017...
We fight again today.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
When we take this castle,
we can use it as a base to@0003@0002
launch attacks on Bern.@0003
@0009...Yes.@0003
@000CPrincess...@0003
May I ask the reason why Bern's
former king tried to murder@0003
King Zephiel?@0003
@0009...Zephiel and I have different mothers.
So I am in actuality his half sister.@0003
@000CI heard that Zephiel's mother
was the Etrurian princess.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
It was an arranged marriage to
strengthen the tie between Bern and@0003
Etruria.@0003
However, our father already had
a woman he loved at that time.@0003
She is my mother.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016The marriage between our father and@0003
Zephiel's mother was forced.@0003
Therefore, our father didn't
love Zephiel's mother and so@0003
always thought badly of Zephiel.@0003
@000CThen is that why the former king
and Zephiel had a bad relationship?@0003
@0009No...@0003
Even then, Zephiel was always trying
his best to gain our father's affection.@0003
He excelled in his studies and military
training and was always trying hard.@0003
He grew to become a proud heir
to Bern's throne.@0003
@000C@0080@000DThen why did the
King try to...@0003
@000DMaster Roy!
We are ready for the attack!@0003
@000BAll right,
I'll be there in a minute!@0003
@0002Princess Guinevere,@0003
I am sorry, but...@0009No, it is alright.
Please be careful.@0003
[01A3]
@000C@0010@012C@0017Brrrr!@0003
I knew Ilia was cold,
but I didn't think it@0003
would be this cold!@0003
And there's just snow
wherever you look!@0003
@0017It's so pretty...@0003
Whoops, I don't have time
to contemplate.
Gotta' get the treasure...@0003
[01A4]
@000A@0010@0102@0017The blizzard is picking up...@0003
This might take much longer
than we expected.@0003
We should head for Bern as soon
as we take the castle.@0003
[01A5]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0129
@000C@0013Big Sister Yuno!@0003
@0009Thany?
Why are you here?@0003
@000C@0014I've been in the Etrurian Army.@0003
I was surprised when I heard that
Edessa got taken by Bern,@0003
but I knew you'd be okay.@0003
@0009@0012Oh?
And why do you say that?@0003
@000C@0014You were captain of the Fleet!
There's no way Bern could defeat you.@0003
@0009Thank you.@0003
Well, you'll be sorry to hear
that I was captured.@0003
@000C@0012@0017Well, that's...@0003
@0009@0014@0017But I won't stay defeated by
Bern for long.
On my own all I could do was
rescue the people in the castle,@0003
but if I joined you, I could@0003
fight Bern as well.@0003
@000CThen are you going to
fight with us?@0003
@0009@0012Yes.@0003
@000C@0013Really? Yes!@0003
@0009Does that make you
so excited?@0003
@000C@0014Yes!@0003
I became a Pegasus Knight because
I wanted to be like you.@0003
Fighting alongside you is like
a dream.@0003
@0009My my...@0003
Well, you always did tend to
go overboard with things...@0003
[01A6]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0128
@000C@0012@0017Yuno!@0003
@0009@0013Tate...
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0014@0017It's a long story...@0003
But anyway,
I'm with the Etrurian Army now.@0003
I heard that Edessa had fallen to
Bern, and I was worried, but...@0003
I'm glad to see that you are
still all right.@0003
@0009@0017... I thought you were originally@0003
fighting for the army that was
fighting against this Etrurian Army.@0003@0002
You didn't...@0003
@000CNo!@0003
I didn't go against the Ilian
Mercenary Code.@0003
I fulfilled my duties as a
mercenary, and then joined the@0003
Etrurian Army.@0003
@0009@0017Of course...@0003
You're a good and diligent girl.
You wouldn't do something like that.@0003
I'm sorry.@0003
@000CNo, it's all right...@0003
And um...
What are you wearing?@0003
@0009This?@0003
Why, this is my Military
Outfit, as you very well know.@0003
Well,
what do you think?@0003
Don't you think I can still go on
as Pegasus Knight Fleet Captain?@0003
@000C@0013@0017But I thought
you retired.@0003@0009@0014@0017I can't be saying that in this
time of emergency!@0003
On my own all I could do was
rescue the people in the castle,@0003
but if I joined you, I could fight
against Bern as well.@0003
@000C@0017So you're going
to fight alongside us?@0003
@0009@0012@0017Yes.@0003
@000C@0014Yes!@0003
I never thought I could fight
alongside you again.@0003
@0009Don't get cocky now.
I haven't gotten too rusty yet either!@0003
[01A7]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0132
@000C@0012@0017Yuno!@0003
@0009@0017Zealot!@0003
@000C@0014@0017Are you all right?
You're not hurt?@0003
They didn't do anything
terrible to you?@0003
@0009@0017Oh Zealot, I am no child.@0003
I am the ex-captain of the
Pegasus Knight Fleet, you know.@0003
@000C@0013@0017That's true,
but...@0003
@0009@0014@0017I'm all right.
I'm not hurt or anything.@0003
@000C@0013Good...@0003
@0009@0014@0017Why are you in the
Etrurian Army?@0003
I thought you were with
the Lycia Alliance.@0003
@000CWell,
it's a long story...@0003
Anyways, this is the Etrurian Army
only by name.@0003
It is actually made up of troops
From the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@0009@0013Oh... I see.@0003
@000CI'm sorry.@0003
I couldn't be at the castle
when I was needed the most...@0003
@0009There is no point in
dwelling on the past.@0003
@000C@0013But you had to go
out and fight...@0003
@0009@0014Oh?
Don't you like my Fleet Captain outfit?@0003
@000C@0013Of course!
But...@0003
@0009@0014@0017Then there is no problem.@0003
You'll be seeing a
lot more of it from now on...@0003
@000C@0013@0017What!
Do you mean...@0003
@0009@0017Yes.@0003I will fight alongside you as well.@0003
@000C@0014@0017No! No no no.
You retired long ago.@0003
So just leave the fighting
to us...@0003
@0009Even after I retired,
I had to fight anyway.@0003
Zealot, there is no safe
place in the world anymore.@0003
@000C@0013Well...@0003
@0009@0014@0017So I will fight,@0003
so I can help bring a time of
peace all the more quickly.@0003
[01A8]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0129
@000C@0013Big Sister Yuno!@0003
@0009Thany?
Why are you here?@0003
@000C@0014I've been in the Etrurian Army.@0003
I was surprised when I heard that
Edessa got taken by Bern,@0003
but I knew you'd be okay.@0003
@0009@0012Oh?
And why do you say that?@0003
@000C@0014You were captain of the Fleet!
There's no way Bern could defeat you.@0003
@0009Thank you.@0003
Well, you'll be sorry to hear
that I was captured.@0003
@000C@0012@0017Well, that's...@0003
@0009@0014@0017But I won't stay defeated by
Bern for long.
On my own all I could do was
rescue the people in the castle,@0003
but if I joined you, I could@0003
fight Bern as well.@0003
@000CThen are you going to
fight with us?@0003
@0009@0012Yes.@0003
@000C@0013Really? Yes!@0003
@0009Does that make you
so excited?@0003
@000C@0014Yes!@0003
I became a Pegasus Knight because
I wanted to be like you.@0003
Fighting alongside you is like
a dream.@0003
@0009My my...@0003
Well, you always did tend to
go overboard with things...@0003
[01A9]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0128
@000C@0012@0017Yuno!@0003
@0009@0013Tate...
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0014@0017It's a long story...@0003
But anyway,
I'm with the Etrurian Army now.@0003
I heard that Edessa had fallen to
Bern, and I was worried, but...@0003
I'm glad to see that you are
still all right.@0003
@0009@0017... I thought you were originally@0003
fighting for the army that was
fighting against this Etrurian Army.@0003@0002
You didn't...@0003
@000CNo!@0003
I didn't go against the Ilian
Mercenary Code.@0003
I fulfilled my duties as a
mercenary, and then joined the@0003
Etrurian Army.@0003
@0009@0017Of course...@0003
You're a good and diligent girl.
You wouldn't do something like that.@0003
I'm sorry.@0003
@000CNo, it's all right...@0003
And um...
What are you wearing?@0003
@0009This?@0003
Why, this is my Military
Outfit, as you very well know.@0003
Well,
what do you think?@0003
Don't you think I can still go on
as Pegasus Knight Fleet Captain?@0003
@000C@0013@0017But I thought
you retired.@0003@0009@0014@0017I can't be saying that in this
time of emergency!@0003
On my own all I could do was
rescue the people in the castle,@0003
but if I joined you, I could fight
against Bern as well.@0003
@000C@0017So you're going
to fight alongside us?@0003
@0009@0012@0017Yes.@0003
@000C@0014Yes!@0003
I never thought I could fight
alongside you again.@0003
@0009Don't get cocky now.
I haven't gotten too rusty yet either!@0003
[01AA]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0132
@000C@0012@0017Yuno!@0003
@0009@0017Zealot!@0003
@000C@0014@0017Are you all right?
You're not hurt?@0003
They didn't do anything
terrible to you?@0003
@0009@0017Oh Zealot, I am no child.@0003
I am the ex-captain of the
Pegasus Knight Fleet, you know.@0003
@000C@0013@0017That's true,
but...@0003
@0009@0014@0017I'm all right.
I'm not hurt or anything.@0003
@000C@0013Good...@0003
@0009@0014@0017Why are you in the
Etrurian Army?@0003
I thought you were with
the Lycia Alliance.@0003
@000CWell,
it's a long story...@0003
Anyways, this is the Etrurian Army
only by name.@0003
It is actually made up of troops
From the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@0009@0013Oh... I see.@0003
@000CI'm sorry.@0003
I couldn't be at the castle
when I was needed the most...@0003
@0009There is no point in
dwelling on the past.@0003
@000C@0013But you had to go
out and fight...@0003
@0009@0014Oh?
Don't you like my Fleet Captain outfit?@0003
@000C@0013Of course!
But...@0003
@0009@0014@0017Then there is no problem.@0003
You'll be seeing a
lot more of it from now on...@0003
@000C@0013@0017What!
Do you mean...@0003
@0009@0017Yes.@0003I will fight alongside you as well.@0003
@000C@0014@0017No! No no no.
You retired long ago.@0003
So just leave the fighting
to us...@0003
@0009Even after I retired,
I had to fight anyway.@0003
Zealot, there is no safe
place in the world anymore.@0003
@000C@0013Well...@0003
@0009@0014@0017So I will fight,@0003
so I can help bring a time of
peace all the more quickly.@0003
[01AB]
@0010@013D@0017S-Someone!
Come and defend me!@0003@0002
It is all over if I am hurt!@0003
[01AC]
@0010@013D@0017W-Wait...
Be my servant!@0003
It is still not too late...@0003@0002
I shall... forgive your crime
of turning your blade...@0003
toward me... Guh...!@0003
[01AD]
@000C@0010@0102@0013@0017Next is Bern...@0003
@0009@0010@0154@0014Master Roy!@0003
Part of Bern's army is hiding in the
ruins on the outskirts of Edessa!@0003
@000C@0012Ruins?@0003
@0009@0014Yes. They say that in it@0003
lies a spear that was used
during the Dragon Human wars.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@000B@0013What! That spear...@0003
@0009It is most probably a Divine Weapon.@0003
@000BWe must hurry to the ruins!@0003
[01AE]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Princess Guinevere,
we will attack Bern now.@0003
So may I ask...@0003
@0009... The rest of the story.@0003
@000CKing Zephiel was an outstanding pupil in
his studies, he was skilled in war craft...@0003
He grew to be the perfect heir for the king.@0003
@0009That is correct.@0003
@000C@0014But still the former king
did not look kindly at him.@0003
@0009In fact...@0003
Our father began to hate Zephiel
because he grew to become such a@0003
brilliant and worthy youth.@0003
@000C@0012What...
is that supposed to mean...?@0003
@0009@0014Our father was a man of ordinary
skill and intellect.@0003
Therefore, Zephiel's outstanding skill
made our father cold towards him.@0003
@000C@0012@0016Jealousy...?@0003
@0009@0014@0016And then one day, our father
told Zephiel that 'the next heir to@0003
Bern would be Guinevere's husband.'@0003
@000C@0013What!
That's awful!@0003
@0009@0014But Zephiel was very patient.@0003
He said that he did not mind even if
he did not gain the throne.@0003
But the people around us, who were
looking forward to Zephiel's ability@0003
to be a good king, would not allow
anyone else to be the heir.@0003
Pressured by the public, our father
lost his patience at last, and...@0003
@000C@0013Decided to kill King Zephiel...?@0003
@0009@0014At a banquet, our father gave Zephiel
a poisoned drink from his own hands.@0003
And that was the first and last cup
that Zephiel ever took from our father.@0003
After returning to his room, Zephiel
started to get sick.@0003
For 10 days and nights, Zephiel lingered
between life and death.@0003
But Murdock, Zephiel's teacher and
loyal general, saved his life.@0003
@000C... The former king never did
anything after that?@0003
@0009No...@0003
But I have heard that he had plans
to get rid of Murdock and Zephiel's@0003
mother as traitors.@0003
He was scheming to murder them all
along with Zephiel.@0003
After hearing that, Zephiel made
believe he was dead.@0003
Our father then checked the coffin to
confirm Zephiel's death.@0003

[01AF]
@0010@0127Tate, Thany,@0005
get ready.@0003@0002
@0017Triangle Attack!!@0003
[01B0]
@0010@0128Yuno, Thany,@0005
Get ready!@0003@0002
@0017Triangle Attack!!@0003
[01B1]
@0010@0129Yuno, Tate,@0005
let's go!@0003@0002
@0017Triangle Attack!@0003
[01B2]
@0008@0010@0194@000A@0010@0191@000C@0010@0157
@000A@0017Excuse me...@0003
@000CYes...?@0003
@000AAre you the one who saved us?@0003
@000CNo, I am...@0003
@000A@0017Thank you!@0003
Thanks to you, we can now stand
here safely.@0003
Please accept this token of our
gratitude.@0003@001C
@0008@0017Thank you!@0003
@0008@0011@000A@0011@001C
@000C@0006@0016......@0016@0003@0002
I shall hand this to Roy...@0003
[01B3]
@0008@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0147
@0008@0017@0013All troops are at their posts
and are ready for battle, my Lord.@0003
@000CGood. Thank you.@0008@0011@0009@0010@0136
@000CGale. So it begins.@0003
@0009@0014Yes, my Lord.
We are ready as well.@0003
@000CYour squad will be the key to
winning the battle.@0003
Understood?@0003
@0009@0013Of course, my Lord.
I will not let you down.@0003
@000C@0014Yes.@0003
We will show them the power of Bern's
@0017main frontline army.@0003
Still... that general from the
Lycia Alliance Army made it this far.@0003
@0009@0013General Roy?@0003
@000C@0014Yes, that's him.@0003
I wish to see how he fights...
by going up against him directly.@0003
[01B4]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@0102@0009@0013Ah, General Roy!@0003
I have found you at last.@0003
@000C@0014@0017Bishop Yodel!@0003
What brings you out here all the
way from Etruria?@0003
Is something wrong?@0003
@0009@0017I did some research after
receiving your letter.@0003
And I have come to the conclusion
that Bern has indeed resurrected@0003
@0002@0017the Dark Dragon!@0003
@000C@0013Is that true!?@0003
... But Hartmut defeated the
Dark Dragon in the war.@0003
How could Bern have brought
it back to life?@0003
@0009@0014Apparently Hartmut did defeat the
Dark Dragon, but he did not@0003
finish it off.@0003
@000C@0012What!?@0003
@0009@0014Instead of killing it, he sealed
it away in the mountains of Bern.@0003
And the sword he used to seal
it was...@0003
@000C@0013The Sword of Seals?@0003
@0009@0014Oh, did you know?@0003
@000C@0013Yes.
I studied a little...@0003
@0009@0014Even if the Dark Dragon has broken out
of its seal, if we can obtain the@0003
Sword of Seals, then we may be able to
seal it again or kill it once and for all.@0003
That is the Church's conclusion, and they@0003
sent me to ask for your assistance.@0003
@000CDo you know where
the Dark Dragon is?@0003
@0009Yes, my next point.@0003
As the fire-breathing Dragons
can change into human form, it is@0003
highly possible that the Dark Dragon
is as well.@0003
In fact, we currently have a suspect.@0003
The Dark Priestess that is always
at King Zephiel's side.@0003
@000C@0013The Dark Priestess...@0003
@0009@0014
We have no solid evidence, but it@0003
is true that she appeared at around the
same time that the other fire-breathing@0003
Dragons started to appear.@0003
@000C@0012@0016......@0003
@0009@0014@0016Apparently, the Dragons sealed away their
power in gems called Dragon Stones to@0003
change into human form so that they could
adapt to this environment.@0003
In that case, it would not be surprising
if the Dark Dragon was in the form of@0003
human woman as well.@0003
@000CIn any case,
we have to go see her to@0003
confirm the truth.@0003
@0009Yes.
I shall accompany you as well.@0003
@000C@0013@0017You would fight alongside us?
That would be most helpful!@0003
@0009@0014Also, take these.@0003
These are the Divine Weapons that the
Church found on its own.@0003
I have instructions to give them to you.@0003
@000C@0012@0017Divine Weapons too!?@0003
@0009@0014If the Dark Dragon has really been
released, then this is the greatest@0003
danger mankind has ever faced since
the Dragon Human wars!@0003
@000CYes.
We will face it with all our strength.@0003
[01B5]
@000C@0010@0136
@0017All right, let's go!
Crush them all.@0003
Leave none alive!@0003
Show the enemy the wrath of
the Dragon Masters of Bern!@0003
[01B6]
@000C@0010@01C7@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0017Have you dealt
with the Divine Weapon?@0003
@0009Yes,
we got rid of it.@0003
@000CGood.@0003
Now, we must go to@0005
Lord Murdock's assistance!@0003
[01B7]
@0009@0010@0136@000C@0010@012E@0017Gale...@0003
@0009Miledy...@0003
@000CGale...
I...@0003
@0009Do not speak...
You and I are both loyal knights.@0003
We both fight for whom we have
pledged our service to.@0003
That is all.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Miledy...@0003
This is probably the end,
so let me say this.@0003
Miledy, I am truly grateful that
I was able to meet you.@0003
We trained our skills together,
and we fought alongside each other.@0003
Miledy...
The days I spent with you...@0003
Those were the happiest days
of my life.@0003
@000CMe...
Mine too...@0003
@0009...Goodbye, Miledy.@0003
I always wish we had met in
a more peaceful time.@0003
@000CGale...@0003@0009@0011@0006
@000C@0080@000DWait!@0003
Gale!@0003
Don't go!@0003
Gaaaaaaale!!!@0003
[01B8]
@0009@0010@0136@000C@0010@012A
@000C@0017Sir Gale...@0003
@0009Zeiss.
It seems you are well.@0003
@000CSir Gale...
Must we fight?@0003
@0009Yes.
We must.@0003
@000CI...
I don't want to fight you!@0003
You're the last person...@0003
@0009Zeiss!
Don't be a child!@0003
@000CHuh...!?@0003
@0009Did you have only so much resolve
when you left Bern?@0003
Is that all the resolve you had when
you decided to fight against Bern!@0003
@000CNo!
My mind is...set...@0003
Even now, it hurts to point my blade
toward Bern, my homeland...
But I believe that the path I chose
wasn't a mistake...!@0003
@0009Then cast away your hesitation!@0003
Focus on crushing those who block
the path that you have chosen.@0003
...No matter who it is.@0003
@000CSir Gale...@0003
@0009Zeiss...
Were you not a knight of Bern?@0003
@000C...Of course!@0003
@0009Good!@0003
When we meet next time, neither
of us will speak.@0003
We will fight!@0003
[01B9]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010E
@000CAh, Bishop Yodel.@0003
@0009Saul, it is good to see you
are well.@0003
And thank you.@0003
The Church has been saved countless
times because you and Dorothy@0003
fought alongside Roy.@0003
@000C...If one such as I was to
be of any help at all,@0003
then I am truly proud.@0003
@0009Oh?@0003
It seems I have never
seen you so serious...@0003
@000CBishop Yodel,
even I am a priest.@0003
I have as much for the common
good as anybody.@0003
@0009I see.
I am sorry.@0003
Then let us fight together,
shall we?@0003
[01BA]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010C
@0009Dorothy.
Have you been well?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
It is good to see
you, Bishop Yodel.@0003
@0009You are always so bright and
full of energy.@0003
I'm sure God loves that part
of you.@0003
@000CDo you think so...@0003
@0009Everyone who comes into contact with your
pure heart has his own heart cleansed.@0003
Like me, for example.
Even Saul.@0003
You should be proud of that.@0003
@000CYes,
Bishop Yodel!@0003
[01BB]

[01BC]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015D@0017
You're the Etrurian Army, right?@0003
There are no soldiers here.@0003
I'll give you this,
so just leave!@0003
[01BD]
@0010@0147
Hm...
You made it this far.@0003@0002
I congratulate you.
But can you defeat me?@0003
[01BE]
@0010@0147
Gah...!
You...are strong...@0003@0002
@0017Zephiel... My king...@0003
I cannot protect you...
any further...@0003
Forgive me...!@0003
[01BF]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Master Roy...
there is a path leading underground.@0003
@000CDoes that mean that the
Sword of Seals is in there?@0003
@0009I don't know...@0003
But I heard from a captive
that there lies two things@0003
inside the temple.@0003
@000C!@0003@0002
@000C@0014Does that mean that
there is another Divine Weapon?@0003
@0009Possibly...@0003
Perhaps we should ask those from
our army who are natives of Bern.@0003
@000C@0013All right.
I'll check with them.@0003
[01C0]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Master Roy.
This sword stuck in the altar...@0003@000C@0013This must be the Sword of Seals.@0003@0009@0011@000A@0010@0154@0014Let's see.
...I can't seem to draw it from the stone.@0003
@000C@0080@000DIt's sealed.
You have to use the Fire Emblem.@0003@000AUse it? How?@0003
@000BPrincess Guinevere said that you
just have to stick it into@0003
the opening of the handle...@0003@0080@0004
@000B@0011@000B@0010@0102@0012Woah!
What the...@0003
@000A@0080@000BThe blade is glowing!@0003
@000BNow I should be able
to draw it... ...!@0003
@0002@0016......!...@0016@0017@0003
[01C1]
 @000B@0010@0102
@0006@0017...What...
is this...?@0003@0006
This is the Sword of Seals'...@0003@0006@0002
No,@0003
Hartmut's memories...?@0003
@0009@0010@014A@0006@0011@000B@0002!@0003
@0002Who was that?@0003@0006@0002
What is this feeling...
It's very...@0017@0003
[01C2]
@0009@0010@0154@000B@0010@0102
@0009@0017Master Roy?
Are you all right?@0003
@000BYeah...
I'm fine.@0003@0002
So this is Hartmut's sword,
the Sword of Seals...@0003
Am I allowed to use it...?@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@012B@0014It has been said for centuries that
the best swords choose their owners.@0003
The sword is in your hands now.
You were chosen by it.@0003
@000B@0013But it's only coincidence
that I'm holding it...@0003
@0008@0014What we may think
as being coincidental...@0003
Even that might be part
of our fate.@0003
@000B@0016......@0016@0003@001C
@000A@0010@0154Anyway, now that we have the
Sword of Seals, all we need to@0003
do is head for the King's castle.@0003
We must hurry!@0003@001C
@000B...Right!
We have to defeat Zephiel!@0003
[01C3]
@0009@0010@0148@000C@0010@0149
@000C@0017So...
Murdock was defeated...@0003
@0009@0012...I am sorry.@0003
@000C@0014...How is the Etrurian army
behaving?@0003
@0009They have captured the Temple of Seals.
They are now headed this way.@0003@000CI see...@0003
Then we shall face them
inside this castle.@0003
@0009@0013Yes.
I will protect you to the death.@0003
@000C@0014Not you.@0003
Brenya, I have a very important
task for you.@0003@0009@0012What...?@0003
@000C@0014Idoun.
Where is Idoun?@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@014B@0012...Here.@0003
@000C@0014I will stay here and defend the
castle from the Etrurian Army.@0003
Idoun, you must escape and hide
until this battle is over.@0003
@0008@0013If his Majesty wishes.@0003@0011@0009@0010@0148
@000C@0014Brenya, I want you
to escape as well.@0003
Protect Idoun.@0003
@0009@0080@000CWhat!?
Please!@0003
Let me fight by your side!@0003
@000CNo.@0003
...This will be a harsh battle.
I cannot afford to lose Idoun now.@0003
If Idoun were to be lost...
This whole war would be meaningless.@0003
@000A@0013But!
I, I...@0003
@000C@0014Enough, Brenya!
This is an order.@0003
Are you telling me that you cannot
follow your king's commands?@0003
@000A@0080@000B@0013No...
I'm not saying that...@0003@0011@0008@0010@014B
@000C@0014Idoun,
even if I were to fall...@0003
You understand, do you not?@0003
@0008Yes...@0003
I will 'free' the
world as you ordered.@0003
@000CRight.
I will not give up my dream now.@0003
@0008@0012Yes.@0003
[01C4]
@0009@0010@01D7@0017The Etrurian Army has come...@0003
I will not let you invade the
throne room!@0003
[01C5]
@000C@0010@01D7@0017I shall protect this
device with my life!@0003
[01C6]
@000C@0010@0102
@0017@0013This is the King's castle...@0003@0009@0010@0154@0014Master Roy,@0003
Zephiel is residing in the throne
room at the center of the castle.@0003
However, there are some special
devices that protect the throne@0003
room when invaders appear.@0003
@000C@0012What kind of devices?@0003
@0009@0014One of the captives said that
at the west end of the castle@0003
there are some switches that
need to be maneuvered first.@0003
@000CIt'll be a long detour...@0003
@0009There is more.@0003
After hitting the switches,
you must hold the 'Gem' in@0003
in front of the throne room
to make it open.@0003
@000CGem?
Is it the Fire Emblem?@0003
@0009Probably.@0003
@000CI have that with me.@0003
So I should head to the throne
room while leaving the switches@0003
to the others...@0003
@0009That would be the shortest way.@0003
@000C...But would the captives leak
that kind of information so easily?@0003
Perhaps it's a trap...@0003
@0009No.
The captive also said, 'The@0003
switches and the door are all defended
by Bern's most powerful warriors.@0003
Even if you knew how to get into the
throne room, you wouldn't be able to@0003
get there.'@0003
@000CWe need to try, even if we're
going up against powerful enemies.@0003
We're pretty strong as well.
We won't lose!@0003
[01C7]
@000C@0010@012CSo this is Bern's castle...
It sure looks sturdy.@0003
There must be riches beyond
belief kept in here!@0003
[01C8]
@000C@0010@FFFF
@0017This is the switch?
Nothing's happening, though...@0003
[01C9]
@000C@0010@FFFF
@0017This is the switch?
Nothing's happening, though...@0003
[01CA]
@0009@0010@0149@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017You have come.@0003
Hmph...how ironic.
A child, stepping in my path.@0003
@000CZephiel...
King of Bern...@0003
@0080@000DI will ask you this.
Why did you start this war!@0003
@0009...
I wish to end the age of man.@0003
@000B@0080@000E@0012...What?@0003
@0009@0014Humans...
Humans are filthy.@0003
They flock to those with power and
would not think twice about betraying@0003
trusted allies to obtain more power.@0003
You must have witnessed numerous
traitors in your travels.@0003
Am I right?@0003
@000C@0016@0012......@0016@0003
@0009Jealousy. Hate. Greed.@0003
Friends, even family members would be
driven to kill by these stupid emotions.@0003
Such emotions make fathers who try to
kill their sons to save their own flesh.@0003
As long as humans control, as long as
humans dictate, as long as humans@0003
exist... this madness will never end.@0003
@000C@0080@000DBut look at what you are doing!@0003
You are one of those humans who
control other humans!@0003
@0009...You know how the Scouring ended.@0003
@000BThe Dark Dragon was
defeated by Hartmut...@0003
@0009That was the mistake.@0003
@000B@0080@000E@0012Mistake?@0003
@0009@0014Mankind should not have won.@0003
Just because the humans came out
victorious, the world came under@0003
their control and transformed into
a world of madness and evil, driven@0003
by accursed emotions!@0003@000C@0016@0012......@0003
@0009@0016@0014Mistakes must be fixed with haste.@0003
I will give back the world to
the Dragons.@0003
I will free the world from the
evil grasp of men.@0003
History must be redone from the
beginning again to save this@0003
world from everlasting evil!@0003@000CThen...@0003
Is it true you resurrected
the Dark Dragon?@0003
@0009@0013You may see that for yourself.@0003
@000C@0014You said you would give the
world to the dragons.@0003
Then rule by humans would just be
replaced with similar rule by Dragons!@0003@0009The Dragons you see now are
weapons for battle.@0003
They have no 'self'.@0003
They have no cruel emotions to
be driven by, unlike humans.@0003
The world under Dragons' control
would be fair and peaceful.@0003
@000CI cannot agree that such a world
would be for the better good!@0003
It is true that humans have many
evil emotions and do terrible@0003
things, but it has always been us
humans who have corrected them!@0003
@0009@0013@0017Hmph...
You are indeed naive.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0014@0017I have faith in mankind.@0003
I will not lose to a man who has lost
faith in people and even in himself!@0003
[01CB]
@0010@0149@0017You shall not bar my path!@0003
[01CC]
@0010@0149@0017.. So you have defeated
me...@0003@0002
But remember...@0003
My will shall never die...@0003
As long as humans retain
control, madness will persist...@0003
[01CD]
@000B@0010@0102@0017Zephiel has fallen...@0003@001C
@000D@0010@0154We've done it,
Master Roy.@0003@001C
@0009@0010@012B...Or have we.@0003@001C
@000DWhat?@0003@001C
@000BWhat do you mean?@0003
@0009I do not see the
Dark Priestess anywhere...@0003@001C
@000DHm...
She escaped.@0003@001C
@000B...So it seems.@0003
[01CE]

[01CF]
@001C@000D@0017What...@0005
What the?@0003@001C
@000BZephiel's sword...
it glowed!@0003
It's...@0003
@0009The Exaccus...@0003
A sword that only the
King of Bern can use...@0003
@001C@000DMaster Roy,@0003
the legends say that
when all of the Divine Weapons@0003
come together, the Dragon
Temple rises out of the ground!@0003@001C
@000BThe Dragon Temple...@0003
@000DIt was the
Dragon's Headquarters...@0003
Or at least, that's what
the legends say.@0003
@0009Yes...
That is correct.@0003
@000BSo is the Exaccus
the last Divine Weapon?@0003
I thought Hartmut's weapon
was the Sword of Seals.@0003
@0009...Maybe...@0003
The Sword of Seals could be something
separate from the Divine Weapons...@0003
Perhaps it is even more powerful...@0003
@000BMore powerful...?
What powers lie in this sword?@0017@0003
[01D0]
@001C@000D@0017The sword glowed again!@0003
The light is pointing
to the south!@0003@001C
@0080@0004
@000BSo the Dragon Temple lies
to where the light in pointing?@0003
@001C@000DIf the legends are true,
then that would indeed@0003
be the case.@0003@001C
@0009...If the Dark Priestess is
indeed the Dark Dragon...@0003
There is a high chance
that she would be there...@0003
@000BAll right.
Let's go to the Dragon Temple!@0017@0003
[01D1]
@0009@0011@000B@0011@000D@0011
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Zephiel...@0003
@000C...Princess Guinevere.@0003
@0009I'm sorry...
Please leave me alone for a while.@0003@0011
@000C@0080@000DPrincess...!@0003
@001C@000D@0010@0154Master Roy...
We should let her be.@0003@001C
@0009@0010@012B... Allow me.@0003
@000BElphin!@0003
@0009Yes?@0003
@000B@0017... Thank you.@0003
I knew you had your own problems
with your own nation...@0003
But you helped us.@0003
I must thank you...@0003
@0009... I don't quite understand what you mean...
But if I have been helpful, then I am glad.@0003
@000BYes.@0003@0009@0011
@000B@0013@0017... Control over humans
by humans...@0003
@000D@0011@0009@0010@0154Zephiel's words?@0003
Perhaps he was right...
in a way.@0003
@000B...Has the Dark Priestess
been found?@0003
@0009@0014No...@0003
Apparently she disappeared
before the battle.@0003
@000B@0080@000EI see...@0003
Do you really think she's
the Dark Dragon?@0003
@0009I wouldn't know at all unless
I actually saw her.@0003
It's going to be difficult to find her
because she is said to be clad in@0003
a black robe all the time, and
no one has ever seen her up close.@0003
@000COh...
But the battle is now over.@0003
@0009What are you saying!
The hard part has yet to come.@0003
We must help the land recover
from the war.@0003
There are people out there
who need our assistance.@0003
@000CRight!
We have work to do.@0003
The real battle is maybe
just beginning.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
We are alive, so we must
think about the future.@0003
@000C@0017No matter what hardships are to come,
I will never give up.@0003
We have to show that even humans can
construct a beautiful and peaceful world!@0003
@0009@0013Master Roy, you will have
me at your side always!@0003
Now, let us leave the castle
for now.@0003@0002
We must spread the word of victory!@0003

@0009@0010@014C@000C@0010@0148
@0017Lord Yahn, here is Idoun.
Please take care of her.@0003
@0009@0013What are you going
to do, human?@0003
@000CWe will stay here and face
the Etrurian Army one last time.@0003
@0009@0012Do you have the troops?@0003
@000C@0014The Dragon Knights scattered around
the continent have all returned@0003
under our cause.@0003
@0009Do you have a chance
of victory?@0003
@000C...Our chances of winning are
not high.@0003
But we are the Bern Army,
the strongest force on the@0003
continent.@0003
We shall at least show them
our unbending will.@0003
@0009Will...@0003
You humans are incompressible
to us at times.@0003
Would your will raise your
chances of winning?@0003
Very well.@0003
We all have our methods of
battle.@0003
[01E9]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0148@000C@0013@0017...Have you spread my
message?@0003
@0009@0014Yes.@0003
"Those who flee the army now will
not be tried guilty of fleeing.@0003
Whether to fight or to leave is
up to each his own."@0003
That was your message,
General Brenya.@0003
@000C@0013How many still
remain with us?@0003
@0009@0014Almost all of the troops are
saying that they still wish to@0003
fight by your side.@0003
@000CAll?
Our chances of victory are slim.@0003
I'm sure many of the troops have
family waiting for them.@0003
They must not feel pressured to
stay.@0003
@0009We are Knights of Bern,
my lady.@0003
We have no intention of bowing our
heads to Etruria.@0003
@000C...I want you to expel those
who are injured and those who have@0003
young children or aged parents.@0003
They must not stay here.@0003@0009@0013But General Brenya...@0003
@000CThat is an order.
Understood?@0003
[01EA]

[01EB]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017Master Roy,
our troops are ready.@0003
@000C@0013...Did the messenger return?@0003
@0009@0014Yes.@0003
...As we suspected, the enemy has
no intention of surrendering.@0003@000CDid you make it clear that their safety
would be guaranteed if they surrender?@0003
@0009Yes.
But they said,@0003
'We appreciate your offer,
but we will not surrender.'@0003
@000CWhy?
Bern already officially surrendered...@0003
@0009This person might understand...@0003
@0009@0011@000A@0010@0157@0016......@0016@0003
@000CPrincess Guinevere...@0005
Do you understand why?@0003
@000AYes.@0003
...Bern recognizes itself as being the
strongest force in Elibe.@0003
Their pride would not allow them to
accept defeat without fighting.@0003
@000C@0012......@0003
@0008@0010@0154@0013Master Roy!
The enemy is advancing!@0003
@000C@0014!
...We have no choice.@0003
We must fight!@0003
Merlinus, send Princess Guinevere
to the back lines...@0003@0008@0011@000ANo.
I will stay here.@0003
I...
must listen to their calls.@0003
That is all a...
traitor like myself can do...@0003
[01EC]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0113@0012@0017Karel!@0003
@0009@0013@0017Ah, Fir...
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0017Wh-What are you doing
in a place like this?@0003
@0009@0014@0017After traveling around the world,
I decided to settle here.@0003
@000C@0017Uncle...
I must tell you something.@0003
Mother...@0003
She...@0003
@0009@0012Yes,
Bartre told me.@0003
I'm sorry I couldn't be with
you during such a rough time...@0003
@000C@0012......@0003
[01ED]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0120@0017@0013K-Karel!@0003
@0009@0014@0017...Bartre?@0003
What are you doing in a
place like this?@0003
@000C@0013@0017I am fighting in the Etrurian Army...
What brings you here, Karel?@0003
@0009@0014@0017After traveling around the world,
I decided to settle here.@0003
@000C@0017Karel...
I must tell you something.@0003
@0009@0012About my sister?@0003
@000C...Did you know?@0003
@0009Fir told me.@0003
@000CForgive me!
I couldn't...@0003
@0009@0014It is not your fault.
It is I who must apologize.@0003
I wasn't able to do anything
during such a rough time...@0003
@000C@0012@0016......@0003
[01EE]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0102
@0009Are you Roy?@0003
@000CWho are you?@0003
@0009I am Karel.@0003
I hereby have decided to
assist your army.@0003
@000CYou're the Sword Saint...@0003
I have heard of your skills.
You are most welcome.@0003
[01EF]
@0009@0010@0161@000C@0010@0112
@0009@0013@0017M-Master Karel!
This will become a battlefield soon...@0003
@000C@0014So I see.
This place is not known to outsiders.@0003
I thought I could be free of warfare
if I stayed here...@0003
@0009@0013What should we do?@0003
@000C@0014Please do not worry.
I will protect the village.@0003
@0009@0013Thank you!@0003
We have nothing to fear with
the Sword Saint on our side.@0003
@000C@0014I am just an ordinary swordsman.@0003
Rumors become larger with time,
so they must not easily be trusted...@0003
...But this battle seems to be
bigger than I thought.@0003
Is my sister all right...?@0003
@0009@0013I never knew you had a sister.@0003
@000CI haven't seen her in a long time,
but I heard a while ago that she fell ill.@0003
I can only hope she is leading a peaceful
life with her husband and daughter...@0003
[01F0]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0113@0012@0017Uncle!@0003
@0009@0013@0017That voice...
Is it Fir?@0003
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0017I never expected to find
you here, Uncle.@0003
@0009@0014@0017After traveling around the
continent, I decided to settle here.@0003
I thought I could train my sword
skills without being caught up@0003
in unwanted messes in a quiet place
like this...@0003
@000C@0017Uncle...
I must tell you something.@0003
Mother... She...@0003
@0009@0012...Died?@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009@0014...@0003
So she didn't survive the illness..@0003
I'm sorry.@0003
I wasn't there when she needed me
the most.@0003
@000C@0012No...it's all right.@0003
@0009@0014But why are you here?@0003
You don't seem like you have been
searching for me just to say that.@0003
@000C@0013Yes.
I'm fighting against Bern now.@0003
@0009@0014You...joined the war?@0003
@000CI know that you don't like getting
caught up in conflicts like this.@0003
But I could not help but try and do
something for those people who are@0003
suffering because of the war.@0003
Uncle... am I wrong?
Did I make a mistake?@0003
Is this not good
for training my sword...?@0003
@0009No, you have not made any
mistakes.@0003
The path you choose on@0003
your own is never wrong.@0003
In fact, I shall assist you
from now on.@0003
@000C@0017Really?!@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
...You are right.
You have grown.@0003
The last time I saw you,
you were still a baby.@0003

@000CUncle..@0003
[01F1]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0120@0017@0013Karel?!@0003
@0009@0014@0017Bartre?
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0013@0017I am currently enlisted
in the Etrurian Army.@0003
I didn't expect to
see you here...@0003
@0009@0014@0017After traveling around the
continent, I decided to settle here.@0003
I thought I could train my sword
skills without being caught up@0003
in unwanted messes in a quiet place
like this...@0003
@000C@0017...I must apologize...@0003
@0009@0012...Is it about my sister?@0003
@000C@0014Yes...
I tried my hardest, but...
@0009@0013She didn't survive...@0003
@000CI am truly sorry!
My weakness couldn't save her...@0003
@0009@0014It is not your fault.
I must apologize.@0003
I couldn't be at her side when
she needed me the most...@0003
@000C@0012...
I must ask you for something.@0003
@0009What is that?@0003
@000CI want this battle to end.
I know you dislike warfare...@0003
But would you help us...?@0003
@0009@0017...I see.
Yes, I will try my hardest.@0003
@000CThank you!@0003
We have nothing to fear with such
a skilled swordsman on our side!@0003
[01F2]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0112
@0017This village has none who
who would wish to fight.@0003
Please leave us in peace.@0003

[01F3]
@0010@0148@0017 @0002
Bern will not lose!@0003
Even if I fall, Bern will
rise back up and fight again!@0003

[01F4]
@0010@0148Your...Majesty...@0003
Now I can go...
to your side..@0003
[01F5]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017This is the Dragon Temple...
The Dark Priestess is in here?@0003
@0009We can count on that.
But...something is bothering me...@0003
@000C@0012What?@0003
@0009@0013In one of the legends of the Scouring,
it is said that the Dragon Temple@0003
holds the power of the dragons.@0003
@000CWhat does that mean?@0003
@0009It is also said that the temple's
power protects the Dragon itself.@0003
@000CWhat...?
I don't understand.@0003
@0009This is just my estimate, but
perhaps it means that the Dragons@0003
inside the temple have much greater
power than those on the outside.@0003
@000CSo...@0003
Our tactics against the Dragons
until now might not work?@0003
@0009Right.@0003
But perhaps if one worthy of using
the Divine Weapons uses one to its@0003
fullest potential, then we might
have a chance.@0003
@000C...We have no other good ideas.
All right.@0003
Then we'll choose those who have
the best skill to enter the temple.@0003
@0009Be careful who you choose.@0003
We might not be able to leave
once we're inside...@0003
[01F6]
@000C@0010@0102@0017This is the Dragon Temple...
The air is strange.@0003
Did the Eight Heroes fight under
such pressure as well?@0003@0080@0004
@0009@0010@014CWould you stand before us
again, humans?@0003
@000C@0080@000DWhat...
Who are you!@0003
When did you...@0003
@0009@0014I am Yahn.@0003
I am the last remaining Dragon
of the Dragon Temple.@0003
@000B@0080@000E@0013The last dragon?@0003
You seem different from the
other dragons...@0003
Are you the Dark Dragon?@0003
@0009The Dragons who you have been fighting
with are War Dragons who know nothing@0003
but battle.@0003
And the Dark Dragon is something
completely different from me.@0003
I am a full-blooded dragon who fought
you humans in the faraway past.@0003
@000CDifferent?@0003
Wasn't the Dark Dragon supposed
to be the leader of the Dragons?@0003
@0009The Dark Dragon is an 'object'
that is meant to bring hope to us@0003
Dragons again.@0003
It is no leader.@0003
@000CWhat?@0005
Then what is the Dark Dragon?@0003
@0009It seems you have much to learn.@0003
@000CTell us!@0005
What is the Dark Dragon?@0003
We...I have to fully understand
my enemy before I fight!@0003
@0009Well...I have no reason to tell
you.@0003
And yet, I have no reason not
to tell you.@0003
What should I do?@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009...All right.@0003
I shall test you to see if you
are worthy of hearing the truth.@0003
I am deep inside the temple.
Fend off our attacks and come to me.@0003
Then I shall explain everything.@0003
@000CBut you're right here!@0003
@0009What you are seeing is just
an illusion.@0003
If you wish to know the truth,
then come to me.@0003
If you prove yourself worthy of@0003
my time, then you shall hear
it all...@0003
[01F7]
@0009@0010@014C@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0013@0017You...
Are you real this time?@0003
Or...@0003
@0009This is but the entrance.
You have a long way to reach me.@0003
But you seem strong enough
not to die immediately.@0003
@000COf course.@0003
@000CWe have gone through
many hardships.@0003
@0009So I see.@0003
Very well, I shall tell you a little
about the Dark Dragon.@0003
The Dark Dragon is not the leader of
the Dragons as you thought.@0003
The Dark Dragon was created to bring
us victory.@0003
@000C@0080@000DCreated...?@0003
So it wasn't the Dark Dragon
making more Dragons...@0003
@0009The Dragons you speak of are correctly
referred to as War Dragons.@0003
As I said before, they are different
from pure Dragons such as I.@0003
Indeed, the War Dragons are created@0003
by the Dark Dragon.@0003
And the Dark Dragon was created out
of the Divine Dragon, the most@0003
powerful of our kind.@0003
@000BCreated out of the Divine Dragon?
Then the Dark Dragon is actually...@0003
The Divine Dragon agreed to become
the Dark Dragon?@0003
@0009Agreed?
No.@0003
We destroyed its soul so that it would
follow our leader's every command.@0003
@000B@0080@000EWhat...!@0003
@0009We desperately needed the power of
the Divine Dragon.@0003
Our entire species was at stake.@0003
@000CYou needed the power of the
Divine Dragon...@0003
But...why did you have to
destroy its soul!@0003
@0009Why, you ask.@0003@0005
If you want that answer,
then seek me out again.@0003
I shall witness your power
further...@0003
[01F8]
@0009@0010@014C@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Not bad, not bad at all.
I wonder how far you will come.@0003
@000CI want you to go
on with your story.@0003
@0009...No matter how much we fought,
you humans just seemed to multiply@0003
endlessly.@0003
Eventually, we began to lose because
of the humans' sheer number.@0003
Therefore, we created the Dark Dragon
that would make War Dragons.@0003
@000CWar Dragons...
Dragons only meant for battle.@0003
@0009That is correct.@0003
But the Divine Dragons did not agree
with us.@0003
They said that would be defying the
laws of nature.@0003
As we were discussing how we could
persuade the Divine Dragons, they@0003
suddenly disappeared.@0003
@000CWhy?@0003
@0009They most likely left us to prevent
us from taking advantage of them.@0003
We could not find the Divine Dragons,
but fortunately, we were able to@0003
capture one.@0003
@000CAnd that became the Dark Dragon?@0003
@0009Right.@0003
And that Divine Dragon, Idoun, was to
become the Dark Dragon.@0003
However, she felt hesitation in letting
the Divine Dragons and us other Dragons@0003
going on to bad terms.@0003
Hesitation...such nonsense is for humans
only.@0003
We have no need for it.@0003@000CThen that hesitation worked
against you...@0003
@0009The Divine Dragon we captured was still
young, but we had no problem because@0003
it was good enough for our purpose.@0003
However, its heart was not with us.
It would not follow our commands.@0003
@000CSo...
You destroyed its heart...@0003
@0009Exactly.@0003
We destroyed its soul to make it
follow our every command.@0003
@000CThat's...terrible.@0003
@0009That is enough for now.@0003
If you want to know more, then
show me more of your power!@0003
[01F9]
@0009@0010@014C@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0013@0017You have taken another step forward.
But the way is still long.@0003
@000CWe shall still reach you!@0003
@0009You have a stout heart.
What do you wish to hear next?@0003
@000CYou succeeded in creating the Dark Dragon.
The Dark Dragon produced War Dragons.@0003
Then why did you lose to the humans?@0003
@0009Indeed, the Dark Dragon continued to produce
War Dragons to use in the battlefield.@0003
We were able to turn the tables on
the humans.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009However, the humans soon found out
about the Dark Dragon.@0003
They concluded that their numbers would
would not be enough to defeat us.@0003
Therefore, they put their efforts into
constructing powerful weapons that@0003
would pierce our scales.
They are what you would call the@0003
the Divine Weapons.@0003
@000CThat part is the same as
our legends...@0003
@0009The most powerful and potent were
chosen out of the humans to wield@0003
their newly crafted weapons.@0003
They came and charged this temple.@0003
However, when the immense power of the
weapons and our power clashed near@0003
Bern, something unexpected happened.@0003
@000CWhat happened?@0003
@0009The laws of Nature started to collapse.
Snow began to fall in mid summer.@0003
Stars shone in the middle of day...@0003
@000CIs that the Ending Winter?@0003
I heard that happened because you Dragons
unleashed too much power into the world...@0003
@0009Is that how your legends go?@0003
@000CThe power in the Divine Weapons
were used to restore order in nature.@0003
That's what our legends say.@0003
@0009All the bad things that happened are
all our fault.@0003
I would have expected you humans to
think like that.@0003
But the truth is what I said.@0003
@000CThen the Divine Weapons were sealed
away so as not to let such a@0003
disaster happen again?@0003
Then all those traps that protected
them were to warn us...@0003
@0009You sealed them away?
That was a good decision.@0003
But they seem to be in
your hands right now.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Do not worry.@0003
The weapons do not seem to have
as much power as they did in the past.@0003
They are unable to bring about
a disaster again.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009The great disaster hurt us
Dragons greatly.@0003
@000CHow?@0003
@0009The disaster was originally the reason
why we lost to the humans...@0003
I shall continue when you advance
a bit further...@0003
[01FA]
@0009@0010@014C@000C@0010@0102
@0009You have come here again.
You are doing better than I expected.@0003
@000C@0017...Please continue the story.@0003
@0009When the order of nature collapsed,
we Dragons took a fatal blow.@0003
The forces of nature weakened,
and it became difficult for us@0003
to retain our original Dragon form.@0003
Therefore, we decided to seal our
powers in gemstones and take the@0003
human form instead.@0003
@000CThose must be the
Dragon Stones...@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
Now we were utterly powerless against
the humans.@0003
In human form, we were just as weak,
no, even weaker than the humans.@0003
The humans took advantage of our
handicap and started attacking the@0003
Dragons that had taken human form.@0003
@000CWhy did you take human form?@0003
@0009In the new order of nature, the
human was the form that required the@0003
least energy to transform into.@0003
The Eight Heroes mercilessly crushed
us, helpless in our human form.@0003
I too suffered a deep wound.@0003
@000CDo you have hate for the
humans who wounded you?@0003
@0009Hate?
Only humans have such ridiculous emotions.@0003
We battled to maintain our species, and
we lost.@0003
That is all.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009However, you humans might
lose this time.@0003
@0009Some human named Zephiel brought
the Dark Dragon back to life again.@0003
@000C@0080@000D!!@0003
Then Zephiel did break the
Dark Dragon's seal!@0003
@0009@0017That is correct.@0003
@0014If you want to hear more, then show
me some more of your worthiness.@0003
[01FB]
@000C@0010@0102@0013@0017@000CYahn!
I know you're there.@0003
@0009@0010@014CHm...@0003
It seems that you did indeed
defeat Zephiel...@0003
You might make it far enough
to be able to fight me.@0003
@000CWhat relation did the
Dark Dragon have to Zephiel?@0003
@0009You know that the founder of Bern
is the Hartmut, the leader of the@0003
Eight Heroes, do you not?@0003
@000CI know that.@0003
@0009Then do you know that Hartmut
didn't kill the Dark Dragon@0003
but only sealed it away?@0003
@000CI know.@0003
But I still don't know
why he did that.@0003
@0009Hm...
I see.@0003
The Eight Heroes eventually defeated our
leader, and they made their way deep into@0003
the temple to find the Dark Dragon.@0003
However, when they arrived at the Dark
Dragon's chamber, all they saw was a@0003
human girl, looking off into space.@0003
It was Idoun.@0003
@000C@0013They didn't fight?@0003
@0009@0014The Dark Dragon had its soul destroyed
to follow our leader's commands.@0003
Since our leader had been killed,
there were no further commands to follow.@0003
@000CThen what happened
to the Dark Dragon?@0003
@0009The Eight Heroes naturally hesitated.@0003
They had expected to see the most
powerful Dragon, but all they saw@0003
was a girl who wouldn't respond
even if spoken to.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009But the Dark Dragon still must be defeated,
so the Eight Heroes prepared for battle.@0003
The girl must then have reacted to their
attack.@0003
She changed into the Dark Dragon and
fought back, just like the War Dragons@0003
who have no heart.@0003
Hartmut then used a blade stronger than
the Divine Weapons and slashed at the@0003
Dark Dragon's scales.@0003
@000CThe Sword of Seals!@0003
@0009I don't know what you humans call it,
but that must be it.@0003
Anyway, when the sword cut through the
Dark Dragon's flesh, it suddenly fell@0003
unconscious.@0003
[01FC]
@0009@0010@014C@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017You have come far.
I am in the chamber right in front of you.@0003
It has been long since I last met humans
in my true form.@0003
I have not left this place ever since
the war.@0003
@000CYou...
You were always here?@0003
@0009One thousand years...@0003
Having survived the Scouring, I waited,
healing my wounds in the process.@0003
I waited for the resurrection of the
Dark Dragon that would bring hope to@0003
us Dragons again.@0003
And that time came.@0003
The Dark Dragon's seal was broken,
and I felt power flowing through my@0003
veins again.@0003
@000CHow does the Dark Dragon's seal being
broken make your strength recover?@0003
@0009The Dragon Temple's power depends
on the Dark Dragon's, and thus the@0003
Divine Dragons' power.@0003
If the Dark Dragon were to be sealed,
then there is no way I could have@0003
recovered to full strength by using@0003
the temple's power.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
@0009After my strength fully recovered,
I set out to look for the person who@0003
had broken the seal.@0003
I used my illusion to search him out
and ask his intentions.@0003
I did not wish to go outside in my
true form, knowing that you humans@0003
now ran the world.@0003
@000CWait...@0003
I thought that Dragons in their
human form lost most of their powers.@0003
Then how are you creating this illusion?@0003
@0009This temple is for the Dragons.@0003
It is the only place that Dragons can use
a little of their power even in human form.@0003
I am a fairly powerful Dragon.@0003
Even in human form, as long as I stay in
the temple, creating illusions is easy.@0003
[01FD]
@0010@014COne thousand years...@0003
My strength has long
recovered.@0003
I can feel it...@0003
[01FE]
@0010@014C@0017So, I have lost...@0003
Humans are truly
unpredictable...@0003

[01FF]
@000C@0010@0102@0013@0017In the next chamber
lies the Dark Dragon...@0003
@0080@0004@0009@0010@0104...Roy...@0003
@000C?
What's wrong, Fa?@0003
You look you're about
to burst into tears.@0003
@0009Is..
Is Fa also an enemy...?@0003
@000CHuh?@0003
@0009When...@0003
When Fa gets big, will Fa
become a bad Dragon too?@0003
@000C!?@0003
@000CWait, Fa.@0003
Tell me what want to
say, slowly.@0003
@0009That man said so...
Dragons and people can't live together...@0003
@000CBut you were living in Nabata
with people, weren't you?@0003
@0009But the Dark Dragon is a
Divine Dragon like Fa is!@0003
And you're going to fight
Dark Dragon, right?@0003
What about Fa?@0003
@0009If Fa grows up...
And becomes like the@0003
Dark Dragon, then...@0003
@000C@0017You don't have to worry about
that.@0003
Even if you grow up, you'll
always be Fa.@0003
You'll always live together
with humans, and with us.@0003
@0009...Really?@0003
@000CSure!@0003
And also, I actually want to
help the Dark Dragon.@0003
@0009@0017Help?@0003
@000CThe Dark Dragon is not acting
on her own will.@0003
She had her soul destroyed.@0003
I...I don't want to kill
her, if I can avoid it...@0003
@0009...Fa doesn't get it.@0003
@000CYou'll understand when you
get a little older.@0003
@0009@0011@000CHartmut posed a question.
And I'll give an answer to it!@0003
[0200]
@000C@0010@0102@0017The Dark Dragon is in here...
Be careful, everyone.@0003
This is our last battle!@0003
[0201]
@0009@0010@014B@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0012@0016......@0003
@000C@0013@0016@0017You're the Dark Priestess..
No, the Dark Dragon.@0003
@0009@0014...Why do you hinder my path?@0003
@000C@0012What...?@0003
@0009@0014I have been commanded to lead this world.@0003
I shall make the world a better place.
Why are you barring my performance?@0003
@000C...You are wrong.@0003
You were only told the world
would become a better place.@0003
The person who ordered you is
already dead.@0003
So stop!@0003
You no longer have any reason
to fight!@0003
@0009@0012@0016......@0003
@000C@0016You...
No, we...@0003
We have no reason to fight.@0003
@0009@0014...A long time ago...@0003
I have a feeling I heard those
same words.@0003
Soft words, like a warm breeze..@0003
@0009@0016...@0016@0003
But that was long ago...
I have been asleep for too long.@0003
In the darkness, I was dreaming...
An empty dream, white, colorless...@0003
But now I am awake.
His Majesty willed me so.@0003
@000C@0014Majesty...Zephiel!@0003
@0009@0014I have woken.
I am no longer who I used to be.@0003
I now clearly understand what
I must do.@0003
@000C@0012@0016......@0003@0005
@0009@0011@0009@0010@014A@0014@0016I must lead this world...@0003
No matter how many days or
nights pass, I must.@0003
I must...@0003
@000C@0013You insist on fighting us?@0003
@0009@0014As long as you stand in
my path.@0003
@000C@0013Such strong...will...@0003
@0009@0014His Majesty wishes it to be.@0003
And I was woken to answer his
Majesty's calls.@0003
[0202]
@0010@0103@0012This is the end!@0005
We mustn't lose now!@0003@0011
[0203]
@0010@0104@0012@0017...Do we have to fight...@0005
...sniff...@0003@0011
[0204]
@0010@0105@0012@0017...We've finally come this far.@0003@0011
[0205]
@0010@0106@0012@0017Is this the end?
@0017Or is it the beginning...@0003@0011
[0206]
@0010@0107@0012@0017This is the Dark Dragon...@0003@0011
[0207]
@0010@0108@0012@0017We cannot afford to make a
mistake this time.@0003@0011
[0208]
@0010@0109@0012@0017I must fight a worthy battle
as an Ostian knight!@0003@0011
[0209]
@0010@01BD@0012@0017You'll be fine, Wendy...
Just trust in yourself.@0003@0011
[020A]
@0010@010A@0012@0017This won't be easy.@0003@0011
[020B]
@0010@010B@0012@0017No matter what happens,
I will protect Master Roy...@0003@0011
[020C]
@0012@0017Can we win...?@0005
No, we have to win!@0003@0011
[020D]
@0010@010D@0012@0017The long battle is about to end.@0003@0011
[020E]
@0010@010E@0012Well, well...
Let's go, I guess.@0003@0011
[020F]
@0010@010F@0012@0017Saint Elimine...
Give us strength!@0003@0011
[0210]
@0010@0110@0012@0017Finally, the battle between
Dragons and men will end at last...@0003@0011
[0211]
@0010@0111@0012@0017I have friends I can trust.
There's no way I could lose now!!@0003@0011
[0212]
@0010@0112@0012@0017So let's see the power of
the Dragon.@0003@0011
[0213]
@0010@0113@0012@0017I will win.
I will win!@0003@0011
[0214]
@0010@0114@0012@0017...It begins.@0003@0011
[0215]
@0010@0115@0012Whoo...@0003
Now there's something you don't
see everyday!@0003@0011
[0216]
@0010@0117@0012A truly powerful enemy!
Haven't met one in years!@0003@0011
[0217]
@0010@0118@0012I will protect Master Roy with
my life!@0003@0011
[0218]
@0010@0119@0012@0017Master Roy, Lord Eliwood...
I shall show you my gratitude now!@0003@0011
[0219]
@0010@011A@0012@0017If we take our time...
We can win.@0003@0011
[021A]
@0010@011B@0012@0017Now...
Peace shall come again...@0003@0011
[021B]
@0010@011C@0012@0017Master Roy,
please be careful.@0003@0011
[021C]
@0010@011D@0012@0017This could be dangerous...@0003
Well, I've been in enough
@0017dangerous situations already.@0003@0011
[021D]
@0010@011E@0012This is it!@0003
The great battle I've been
waiting for!@0003@0011
[021E]
@0010@011F@0012@0017We must be wary...@0003@0011
[021F]
@0010@0120@0012@0017Aaaaarrrr!!!
My blood boils!@0003@0011
[0220]
@0010@0121@0012@0017...I won't lose.
I can defend us all!@0003@0011
[0221]
@0010@0122@0012@0017Father...
Watch over us.@0003@0011
[0222]
@0010@0123@0012@0017Whoa!
We gotta fight that thing!?@0003@0011
[0223]
@0010@0124@0012This is it!
Yes!@0003
This is the power I've been
searching for!!@0003@0011
[0224]
@0010@0125@0012@0017This is the Dark Dragon...!
@0017Such immense power...!@0003
Yes...!@0003@0011
[0225]
@0010@0126@0012@0017It's...huge...@0003
@0011
[0226]
@0010@0127@0012@0017The time has come...@0003@0011
[0227]
@0010@0128@0012@0017I...will not lose!@0003@0011
[0228]
@0010@0129@0012@0017All right!
Chaaaaarge!@0003@0011
[0229]
@0010@012A@0012@0017I'll focus all my strength
into this one thrust!@0003@0011
[022A]
@0010@012B@0012@0017Let there be peace in
your dying heart...@0003@0011
[022B]
@0010@012C@0012Well, let's go then,
shall we?@0003@0011
[022C]
@0010@012D@0012@0017I can sense...
A sad heart...@0003@0011
[022D]
@0010@012E@0012@0017I will not lose...
For the troops back in Bern...@0003
...For Gale...@0003@0011
[022E]
@0010@012F@0012@0017I'm not afraid!
This time I'm not afraid!!@0003@0011
[022F]
@0012Yeah, we'll be fine.@0003@0011
[0230]
@0010@0131@0012@0017Sigh....
Give me a break...@0003@0011
[0231]
@0010@0132@0012@0017Now,
Ilia will know peace...@0003@0011
[0232]
@0010@0133@0012@0017This is the end...
Finally, It will end...@0003@0011
[0233]
@0010@0134@0012@0017Roy, concentrate.@0003@0011
[0234]
@0010@0135@0012@0017I hope this'll
be the last battle.@0003@0011
[0235]
@0010@0116@0012@0017I know I've become strong...
Now's the time to show it!!@0003@0011
[0236]
@000C@0010@0102@0017I will not give up!@0003
I have the sword of Hartmut,
who pitied you and did not kill you!@0003
Everyone...
Leave the final blow to me!!@0003
[0237]
@000C@0010@0102@0017I don't want to defeat you...
But I can't leave things as they are!@0003
Our history isn't all clean...
But it isn't all dirty, either!@0003
I will fight and prove that!@0003
[0238]
@0010@014A@0017I...I...
Gah... I...@0003
Alone...
Dark...@0003
Alone...in...darkness...@0003
[0239]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0102@0009@0012@0017Ah!@0003
@000C@0013What's happening...
The temple is starting to collapse!@0003
Everyone!
Hurry outside!@0003
@0009Roy...@0003
@000CI know.@0003
Leave the rest to me.
Now go!!@0003
[023A]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009Master Roy!
You are all right!@0003
@000CYes...
@0017But the temple is gone.@0003
@0009It is over a thousand years old,
and a lot of energy was released@0003
in the battles just fought.@0003
The building probably couldn't
withstand it.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
@0009So times are changing again.
And...@0003
Who is that you are carrying
on your back?@0003
@001C@000D@0010@014B@001C@000C@0017Her?
Oh, right.@0003
Merlinus,
I need to ask something of you...@0003
[023B]
And thus this conflict, called 
[023C]
"The Great Movement of Bern," ended. 
[023D]
Bern finally surrendered. 
[023E]
Etruria took watch over Bern for a while, 
[023F]
but never directly interfered 
[0240]
in their state affairs. 
[0241]
With the help of Roy, 
[0242]
who played the biggest role in the war, 
[0243]
Bern was rebuilt, 
[0244]
with Guinevere as its queen. 
[0245]
And on the day of her crowning... 
[0246]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0102
@0009Princess Guinevere is to
be crowned today.@0003
@000CI haven't see her in her
royal garments yet.@0003
She must look beautiful
beyond words.@0003
Even when I first met her,
I couldn't believe that such a@0003
beautiful person existed.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
@000C@0017But the princess' hardships
are still to come.@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000CEven if she becomes queen
of Bern with Etruria's help,@0003
I'm sure there will be a lot of
rebellion and unrest.@0003
@0009Do you think so?@0003
@000CI think that there might be
people who'll say that Princess@0003
Guinevere joined Etruria just to
seize the throne.@0003
She'll have to face them.@0003
@0009...But I think Princess
Guinevere will be fine.@0003
And then Bern will become
a much better nation than before..@0003
@0017She's just so smart...
And strong...@0003
@000CYeah...
I think so too.@0003
@0009@0017...What are you going
to do now?@0003
@000C@0017Me?
I'll return to Pherae.@0003
I'm worried about my father's
illness, and we'll have to@0003
start rebuilding the lands
that were trampled on by@0003
the war.@0003
@0009@0017Um...
I...@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009@0017Uh...Nothing.@0003
@0017So you're returning
to Pherae...@0003
@000C@0017What about you?@0003
You're going back to Ostia,
right?@0003
@0009...Yes.
I must take my father's place.@0003
@000CI'm glad to hear that
you'll be staying in Ostia.@0003
@0009@0017...Why?@0003
@000C@0017Because if you're in Ostia, then
I can go meet you any time I want.@0003
@0009@0017What...@0003
@000C@0017Lilina...@0003
I don't know when,
but some day...@0003
I'll go pick you up.@0003
@0009@0017...I...
I have to prepare, too..@0003@0002
But...Roy...
I always...@0003
@000COh!@0003
The ceremony's starting.
Come on, Lilina, we have to@0003
@0017go see Princess...
I mean, Queen Guinevere!@0003
And pay our respects!@0003
@0011
@0009@0017So...I always...
What!?@0003
R-Roy, wait for me!@0003@0011
[0247]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102@000CPrincess Guinevere,
congratulations on your crowning.@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
But my battle is only about
to begin.@0003@000C@0017I'm sorry...@0003
I had to rely on Etruria
to fulfill my task.@0003
@0009@0017No, I am grateful.@0003
However, I think that there will
@0017be people who will think that@0003
I joined Etruria just to seize
the throne.@0003
@000CPrincess...@0003
@0009But the most important thing now
is to rebuild Bern.@0003
I will try my best to gain the
people's trust by bringing@0003
Bern back to life.@0003
No matter how long it takes...@0003
@000CIf there is anything I can
do to help, please don't@0003
hesitate to ask.@0003
@0009@0017Thank you.@0003
Some day I might.
Roy, are you...@0003
@000C@0017Yes?@0003
@0009@0017What are you going to do?
Will you remain in the Etrurian Army?@0003
@000CNo,
I will return to Pherae.@0003
I'm worried about my father's
illness, and we have to start@0003
rebuilding the lands that were
trampled by the war.@0003
@0009You are returning to your homeland?
That is just like you.@0003
Still...@0003
Someone of your ability could easily
aim for high power in the Etrurian Court.@0003
@000C@0017M-Me!? No no no,
I have no such ability!@0003
@0009@0017Pherae's people are fortunate
to have such a gifted leader as you.@0003
[0248]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0152@0017Princess...@0005
I mean, Your Highness...@0003
@0009@0017Guinevere is fine.
What is the matter?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, Lady Guinevere.
The ceremony is about to begin!@0003
@0009@0017Thank you.@0005
I will be there shortly...@0003
[0249]
@0008@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102
@0008@0017Roy,
will you come with me?@0003
@000CMe?@0003
@0008Ever since I left Bern with the Fire
Emblem, you have helped me tremendously.@0003
I want you to see the path Bern will
take with my leadership.@0003
@000COf course.@0003
If it is all right with you, then
I will be glad to accompany you.@0003
@0008@0017Then...@0003
@000CLet us go see a new Bern...
And a new age.@0003

[024A]
Later, in Arcadia...
[024B]
@0009@0010@0161@000C@0010@0102
@0009Ah, Master Roy.
It has been a long time.@0003
@000CI had business in these areas,
so I decided to stop by on the way.@0003
@0009Fa will be glad to see you.@0003
@000CI saw her earlier.
She is as energetic as ever.@0003
@0009She is being allowed outside
more these days.@0003
Perhaps that is why.@0003
@000C@0017How is the girl
I sent here doing?@0003
@0009We succeeded in restoring
her soul, but...@0003
@000C...She still won't go
back to normal?@0003
@0009Fa sometimes takes her outside,
but she won't try to do anything@0003
on her own.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
@0009Master Roy...@0003
@0009We knew that the girl you sent here
was captured by the Dragons.@0003
Still, we did not try and rescue her.@0003
We feared that our kind would be
in danger if we showed ourselves@0003
in front of them again.@0003
But now, I wonder whether
my judgment was correct...@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Perhaps it is because we
have begun to live with humans.@0003
I will make my best efforts to
bring the girl's heart back fully.@0003
@000C...Thank you.@0003
@0009As a first, I would like to see some
sign that her emotions are working...@0003
Like laughing or crying, or something...@0003
[024C]
@000C@0010@014A@0009@0010@0104
And that@0006 is called@0006 a@0006
tree!@0007@0005
@000C@0017Tree...@0007@0005
@0009@0080@000B@0017Right!@0005@0006
And that @0006tree gives@0005
yummy fruit!@0007@0006
@000C@0017Fruit?@0007@0005
@0009@0017Yes. @0006Can you see?
It's up at the top.@0007@0006
And if you @0006shake the tree@0006
like this...@0080@000B@0080@0004
@0080@000B@0080@0004
@0009@0017Oww!@0080@000B@0080@0004
@0006@0005
@0009@0017It fell on@0006
Fa's head...@0007@0006
@000C@0017
@0009...? @0006Did you@0006
just@0006 laugh?@0007@0005@0003
@000C@0017Laugh...?@0006This is to laugh?@0007@0005
@0009@0017Where's @0006Roy? @0006Fa has to@0007@0005
@0009@0080@000B@0080@000Btell Roy@0006
that @0006Idoun laughed!@0003 
[024D]

[024E]

[024F]

[0250]
@000C@0010@014AA warm...breeze...@0005@0006@0006
[0251]
@000C@0010@0102@0017What's happening...
The temple is starting to collapse!@0003
Everyone!
Hurry outside!@0003
[0252]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009Master Roy!
You are all right!@0003
@000CYes...
@0017But the temple is gone.@0003
@0009It is over a thousand years old,
and a lot of energy was released@0003
in the battles that we just fought.@0003
Probably the building couldn't
withstand it.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
@0009Well, Master Roy,
this is the end.@0003
@000C@0017No, it's not over yet.
This is just the beginning.@0003
We have to help the land and
the people recover from the war.@0003
We have much work to do.
The real battle is just beginning!@0003
[0253]
And thus this conflict, called 
[0254]
"The Great Movement of Bern," ended. 
[0255]
Bern finally surrendered. 
[0256]
Etruria took watch over Bern for a while, 
[0257]
but never directly interfered 
[0258]
in their state affairs. 
[0259]
With the help of Roy, 
[025A]
who played the biggest role in the war, 
[025B]
Bern was rebuilt, 
[025C]
with Guinevere as its queen. 
[025D]
And on the day of her crowning... 
[025E]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0102
@0009Princess Guinevere is to
be crowned today.@0003
@000CI haven't see her in her
royal garments yet.@0003
She must look beautiful
beyond words.@0003
Even when I first met her,
I couldn't believe that such a@0003
beautiful person existed.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
@000C@0017But the princess' hardships
are still to come.@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000CEven if she becomes queen
of Bern with Etruria's help,@0003
I'm sure there will be a lot of
rebellion and unrest.@0003
@0009Do you think so?@0003
@000CI think that there might be
people who'll say that Princess@0003
Guinevere joined Etruria just to
seize the throne.@0003
She'll have to face them.@0003
@0009...But I think Princess
Guinevere will be fine.@0003
And then Bern will become
a much better nation than before..@0003
@0017She's just so smart...
And strong...@0003
@000CYeah...
I think so too.@0003
@0009@0017...What are you going
to do now?@0003
@000C@0017Me?
I'll return to Pherae.@0003
I'm worried about my father's
illness, and we'll have to@0003
start rebuilding the lands
that were trampled on by@0003
the war.@0003
@0009@0017Um...
I...@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009@0017Uh...Nothing.@0003
@0017So you're returning
to Pherae...@0003
@000C@0017What about you?@0003
You're going back to Ostia,
right?@0003
@0009...Yes.
I must take my father's place.@0003
@000CI'm glad to hear that
you'll be staying in Ostia.@0003
@0009@0017...Why?@0003
@000C@0017Because if you're in Ostia, then
I can go meet you any time I want.@0003
@0009@0017What...@0003
@000C@0017Lilina...@0003
I don't know when,
but some day...@0003
I'll go pick you up.@0003
@0009@0017...I...
I have to prepare, too..@0003@0002
But...Roy...
I always...@0003
@000COh!@0003
The ceremony's starting.
Come on, Lilina, we have to@0003
@0017go see Princess...
I mean, Queen Guinevere!@0003
And pay our respects!@0003
@0011
@0009@0017So...I always...
What!?@0003
R-Roy, wait for me!@0003@0011
[025F]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102@000CPrincess Guinevere,
congratulations on your crowning.@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
But my battle is only about
to begin.@0003@000C@0017I'm sorry...@0003
I had to rely on Etruria
to fulfill my task.@0003
@0009@0017No, I am grateful.@0003
However, I think that there will
@0017be people who will think that@0003
I joined Etruria just to seize
the throne.@0003
@000CPrincess...@0003
@0009But the most important thing now
is to rebuild Bern.@0003
I will try my best to gain the
people's trust by bringing@0003
Bern back to life.@0003
No matter how long it takes...@0003
@000CIf there is anything I can
do to help, please don't@0003
hesitate to ask.@0003
@0009@0017Thank you.@0003
Some day I might.
Roy, are you...@0003
@000C@0017Yes?@0003
@0009@0017What are you going to do?
Will you remain in the Etrurian Army?@0003
@000CNo,
I will return to Pherae.@0003
I'm worried about my father's
illness, and we have to start@0003
rebuilding the lands that were
trampled by the war.@0003
@0009You are returning to your homeland?
That is just like you.@0003
Still...@0003
Someone of your ability could easily
aim for high power in the Etrurian Court.@0003
@000C@0017M-Me!? No no no,
I have no such ability!@0003
@0009@0017Pherae's people are fortunate
to have such a gifted leader as you.@0003
[0260]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0152@0017Princess...@0005
I mean, Your Highness...@0003
@0009@0017Guinevere is fine.
What is the matter?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, Lady Guinevere.
The ceremony is about to begin!@0003
@0009@0017Thank you.@0005
I will be there shortly...@0003
[0261]
@0008@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102
@0008@0017Roy,
will you come with me?@0003
@000CMe?@0003
@0008Ever since I left Bern with the Fire
Emblem, you have helped me tremendously.@0003
I want you to see the path Bern will
take with my leadership.@0003
@000COf course.@0003
If it is all right with you, then
I will be glad to accompany you.@0003
@0008@0017Then...@0003
@000CLet us go see a new Bern...
And a new age.@0003

[0262]
Peace returned to the world, 
[0263]
and the people slowly began to recover. 
[0264]
As stability returned, 
[0265]
Elibe faced a new age of prosperity. 
[0266]
And thus, 
[0267]
the story of the many people 
[0268]
who mourned, wept, and laughed 
[0269]
during this great conflict 
[026A]
came to a close...
[026B]
@0010@0102@0017Everyone...I'm sorry...@0003
[026C]
@0010@0103@0017No! Please, help!@0005

meadow again...@0003

[02A2]
@0010@011C@0017Master Roy...

@0010@0154@0017Master Roy!
Forgive me...!@0003
[02A4]
@0010@0157@0017Roy...!
Don't die...@0003
[02A5]
@0010@0142@0017You...!
You're that girl that was...!@0003@0011
@0010@0103@0017? Excuse me?
Have we met before?@0003@0011
@0010@0142@0017What!@0003
You have forgotten me,
of all people?!@0003
That...must not be!@0003
[02A6]
@0010@0142@0017You're Princess Guinevere's...
Ha!@0003
@0017So you betray your nation
and turn to the enemy.@0003
Disgraceful!@0003@0011
@0010@012E@0017My loyalty is with
the princess.@0003
And so it shall
remain!@0003@0011
[02A7]
@0010@0142@0017You...@0003@0011
@0010@012AGeneral Narshen...@0005
No, Narshen!@0003
I heard everything
from Sir Gale!@0003
Do you not...have any
honor left in you at all!@0003@0011
@0010@0142Gale...! Dammit, is he
ever an eyesore!@0003
@0017Well, it shall be fine...
Once I get rid of you,@0003
everything will be
shrouded in mystery...@0003
[02A8]
@0010@0142@0017You're...@0003
@0017So being defeated
once wasn't enough?@0003@0011
@0010@0134@0017Zephiel was the one
who defeated me.@0003
Not you.@0003@0011
@0010@0142Then I shall show you
my strength now!@0003
[02A9]
@0010@0142Well, if it isn't
General Percival, the traitor!@0003@0011
@0010@011A@0017
Joining you...was the biggest
mistake of my life.@0003
And now I shall repent
for it...by defeating you!@0003
[02AA]
@0010@0147@0017You were one of Narshen's
troops.@0003
I heard the story from Gale.@0003
I do feel sorry for you,
but you are currently an enemy.
Come!@0003
We fight!@0003
[02AB]
@0010@0147@0017Miledy...
I don't want to fight you.@0003
But you are here.
It seems we have no choice.@0003
Come!@0003
[02AC]
@0010@0147So!
You are General Roy!@0003
I have been looking forward
to matching blades with you!@0003
[02AD]
@0010@0148@0017Miledy...
So you have chosen the@0003
@0017path with Princess
Guinevere.@0003
That is one way...
But I have chosen my path,@0003
@0017as you yours. I must
fight to defend it!@0003
[02AE]
@0010@0148@0017You are a knight of Bern?@0003
@0017So you have chosen
the path with Princess Guinevere.@0003
That is one way...
But I have chosen my own path,@0003
@0017as you yours. I must
fight to defend it!@0003
[02AF]
@0010@0142Well, if it isn't
General Percival, the traitor!@0003@0011
@0010@011A@0017
Joining you...was the biggest
mistake of my life.@0003
And now I shall repent
for it...by defeating you!@0003
[02B0]
@0010@01CD...A survivor of
the Kutolah Clan?@0003@0011
@0010@0105@0017Monke!
Feel the Kutolah wrath!@0003@0011
[02B1]
@0010@01CD@0017You are the
Silver Wolf's granddaughter...@0003@0011
@0010@0106@0016......@0003
[02B2]
@0010@0145Tate? What are you doing here?@0003
@0017Oh...
You've joined the Etrurian side.@0003@0011
@0010@0128Captain Sigune...@0003@0011
@0010@0145You know the Ilian Knightly
Code.@0003
I won't go easy on you.@0003
[02B3]
@0010@0145You...@0003
You're Yuno's youngest sister.@0003@0011
@0010@0129@0016......@0016@0003@0011
@0010@0145By the honor of an Ilian Knight...
I won't go easy on you.@0003
All right?@0003@0011
@0010@0129@0017Yes...@0003@0011
[02B4]
@0010@0144@0017Lady Lilina?@0003
Damn, you were supposed
to be dead by now...@0003@0011
@0010@0122Leygance...
Why?@0003@0011
@0010@0144Times are changing,
my Lady.@0003
I'm just making sure
I don't get left behind.@0003
I'm not like Lord Hector,@0003
who was too foolish to
realize the change.@0003@0011
@0010@0122Quiet!
You will not insult@0003@0005
my father any further!@0003
[02B5]
@0010@0108@0017Leygance, you fool!@0003
Are you not ashamed that
you betrayed Lord Hector?!@0003@0011
@0010@0144Barth... Shut up.@0003
@0017Lord Hector stupidly caused
his death.@0003
I do not plan on falling
with him.@0003
@0011
@0010@0108@0017Why, you...!@0003
[02B6]
@0010@0144Bors! So you were
still alive.@0003@0011
@0010@0109@0017Of course.@0003
Taking over Ostia while
we weren't around...@0003@0011
@0010@0144@0017Is that a problem?@0003
Then try and take it back
with your own strength and skill!@0003
[02B7]
@0010@01BD@0017General Leygance!
You shall rest here!@0003@0011
@0010@0144@0017Ah, Bors' sister, is it?@0003
It's nice to be brave and all,
but can you really defeat me?@0003
[02B8]
@0010@013C@0017Bors! You returned!@0003@0011
@0010@0109Causing a rebellion during
Lord Hector's absence?!@0003@0002
That is unforgivable!@0003
[02B9]
@0010@0146@0017Klein!
You would betray me?@0003@0011
@0010@010DYou are the one who
betrayed Etruria,@0003@0002
Lord Arcard!@0003
[02BA]
@0010@0146@0017D-Douglas!@0003
You had turned to the enemy...!?@0003

[02BB]
@0010@013DDouglas...hmph!
After all that you said,@0003
you too are following
those with power!@0003@0011
@0010@010A@0017Perhaps it may seem that way
from the outside. But there is@0003
@0017no hesitation in my
heart now.@0003@0011
@0010@013D@0017Silence!
I've had just about enough@0003
of you. Die here!@0003
[02BC]
@0010@010F@0017You are a priest...@0003
Are you not?@0003
@0011
@0010@0140@0017What of it?@0003
Anything can go unpunished...
If done in the name of God!@0003
@0011
@0010@010F@0017...That's unforgivable.@0003@0011
[02BD]
@0010@010E@0017We certainly have an evil
bishop here now, don't we?@0003@0011
@0010@0140@0017I am simply living
life the way I see fit.@0003
Anything can go unpunished
if it's in the name of God.@0003
Convenient,
is it not?@0003@0011
@0010@010E@0017You disgrace God...@0003
Then you shall be
punished for that!@0003@0011
[02BE]
@0010@0136@0017I have no regrets...@0003@0002

I see... You could buy it if
your inventory wasn't full.@0003
[02F0]
Hm, your transporter is full, too.
You should come back later.@0003
[02F1]
Hm, your transporter is full, too.
You should come back later.@0003

Too bad, your tranporter is full

@0009@0017Lilina, are you all right?
Do you need anything?@0003
@000CNo, I don't need anything
right now.@0003
@0009Are you hurt?@0003
@000CNo, I'm fine.@0003
@0009Oh, okay.@0003
Then is there anything I could
do for you...@0003
@000CRoy, it's all right.@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000C@0017Thanks for worrying about me,
but I'll be fine.@0003@0009Well, in that case...@0003
But if there's anything you need,
tell me.@0003
Okay?@0003
@000COkay.@0003
[030D]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0122
@0009@0017Lilina.@0003
Lilina!@0003
@000C@0017Roy?@0003
@0009What's the matter?
You were looking off into space again.@0003
We're in a battle.
You could get killed!@0003
@000CI'm sorry.@0003
@0009What's wrong?@0003
@000CIt's just that...
We've come a long way.@0003
@0009Long?@0003
@000CNot distance-wise...@0003
It's just that everything seems to
be changing so quickly.@0003
Do you remember the time when you
came to Ostia to study?@0003
@0009Of course.
2 years...@0003
Wait, was it 3 years ago?@0003
@000CAt that time, your father and my
father were still well.@0003
Lycia was so peaceful...
No one would have imagined a war.@0003
...It all seems as if it were 10
years ago.@0003
@0009Lilina...@0003
@000CI sound so foolish...@0003
There's no way we can go back
there anyway...@0003
[030E]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0122
Roy...
I'm sorry about the other day.@0003
@0009The other day?@0003
@000CI was on some
nostalgia trip, remember?@0003
We're in a war...
Of course things won't be the same...@0003
@0009Well, some things will.@0003
@000CLike what?@0003
@0009I'll be at your side,
and you'll be at mine.@0003
@000CHuh...@0003
@0009We can't go back to the past,
but we can shape the future.@0003
Then we should work to make
a future the same as, or even@0003

better than the past, right?@0003
@000CHehehe...@0003
@0009?@0003
@000CRoy, you're showing off...@0003
@0009D-Do you think so?@0003
Yeah, I was thinking that didn't
sound like me...@0003
@000CBut...@0003
@0009Huh?@0003
@000CThanks...@0003
@0009Lilina...@0003
@000CWe'll always be together...@0003
Right?@0003
@0009...Of course.@0003
[030F]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@011C
@000C@0017
@0009@0017What's the matter, Marcus?@0003
@000C@0017Not good.
Not good at all.@0003
@0009@0017What's not good?@0003
@000C@0017The youths these days, their fighting
has much to be desired.@0003
It isn't all of them, but most of them
seem pampered in my eyes!@0003
We must make stricter exercise plans...@0003
@0009@0017I don't think they're pampered...
They're all doing their best.@0003
@000C@0017No!@0003
Master Roy,
you are too soft on them.@0003
I shall go and show them
an example!@0003
@0009@0017Are you sure you have to
go on your own?@0003
You're not, you know,
young anymore.@0003
@000C@0017Nonsense!@0003
I may be old, but I shall not
lose to the young ones yet!@0003
@0009@0017Ah...okay.@0003
But you're still not young any more,
so watch out for your health.@0003
@000CYes, of course.
Thank you.@0003@0009@0011
@000CMaster Roy is so thoughtful...@0003
Now look at those other young ones
compared to him...disgraceful!@0003
I must help Master Roy in their
place.@0003
[0310]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@011C
@000CMaster Roy, I still think that
we should make our rules stricter.@0003
@0009Stricter?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
And we expel those who aren't
doing their job properly.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Although our army will be small,
we will have a team of elites.@0003
That way, we can fight more
efficiently.@0003
@0009No, Marcus.@0003
That's not a good idea.@0003
@000C@0017Eh...
Why?@0003
@0009@0017Who's going to choose whether
someone is not doing their job?@0003
@000COf course, that would
be you, Master Roy.@0003
@0009But some people might be
working when I'm not looking.@0003
@000C@0017Oh...
Well, in that case...@0003
@0009@0017There are also people supporting us
outside of the battlefield, and there@0003
also those whom we don't use because
of my decisions who haven't yet had@0003
a chance.@0003
You want to simply expel them all?@0003
We have many people who joined us
with strong beliefs.@0003
We can't just tell them to leave.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Marcus, we have to trust them more.
They're our comrades, right?@0003
@000C...You are right.@0003
I was mistaken, Master Roy.
Your thoughts are noble.@0003
@0009You know, it's kind of strange
hearing you praise me like that.@0003
You're usually scolding me most
of the time.@0003
@000COh?
Am I?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003@0011
@000CMaster Roy...
He has gotten so bold...@0003
He can now certainly live on
his own.@0003
My role is almost finished...@0003

[0311]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@011C
@0009Marcus, is something wrong?
You seem not well these days.@0003
@000CI'm sorry.@0003
When I think of a good time
that I should retire...@0003
Well, aging certainly
isn't a fun thing...@0003
@0009Retire?@0003
@000CThe young soldiers have grown strong.
Perhaps it is the right time.@0003
@0009@0017...Marcus.
What are you saying?@0003
@000C@0017I am old...@0003
It wouldn't be for your benefit
that an old man like me by your side.@0003
I should give way for the next
generation...@0003
@0009No...@0003
@000CI should be retiring soon.@0003
@0009@0017No!@0003
I order you to stay!@0003
@000C@0017Master Roy...@0003
@0009I'll apologize if you're angry
about what I said the other day.@0003
So don't say you'll retire.@0003
@000CBut an old man like me...
I shouldn't be in battles anymore.@0003
@0009I still have lots of things
that I need to learn from you.@0003
But if you leave...
Who can I turn to for advice?@0003
@000CMaster Roy...
You trust this old knight so much...@0003
@0009Don't say you'll retire...@0003
I still need your help from
now on.@0003
@000CYes...
I shall serve you till my death...@0003
[0312]
@0009@0010@010B@000C@0010@0102
@000CWolt!@0003
@0009Master Roy,@0005
is something wrong?@0003
@000C...Just call me Roy.
We grew up like brothers, you know.@0003
@0009@0017I appreciate your kindness,
but rules are rules.@0003
@000CDo you think so?@0003
You've suddenly become
a faraway person.@0003
@0009@0017What are you saying?@0005
I'm right here in front of you.@0003
@000C@0017That's not what I mean.@0003
@0009@0017Haha, I know.@0003
But I must not slack off in areas
like this.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Well then, let's go!@0003
We have a long ways yet,
Master Roy.@0003
[0313]
@0009@0010@010B@000C@0010@0102@000C@0017Wolt!
About the other day...@0003
@0009Master Roy, that conversation
was settled.@0003
More importantly, this
is a battlefield.@0003
You never know where
enemies are hiding.@0003
Please be sure to keep
on your guard.@0003
@000CWolt...@0003
You're starting to sound like
Merlinus and Marcus.@0003
@0009Am I?
Thank you!@0003
That is such praise.@0003
My goal is to become a loyal
servant like them.@0003
@000C...Are you serious?@0003
@0009Of course!@0003
@000CI see.@0003
@0009Master Roy?
Is something wrong?@0003
@000CNothing.@0003
Leave me alone for a while,
will you?@0003
@0009Master Roy...?@0003
[0314]
@0009@0010@010B@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017Master Roy!@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009You do not look well.
Is there something on your mind?@0003
@000C...Well, actually there is.
Would you mind if we talked about it?@0003
@0009@0017!
Of course!@0003
I'll do my best to help.@0003
@000C@0017You see, I'm kind of angry
at this person in the army.@0003
What he's saying is true
and makes sense, but...@0003
@0009I see.@0003
What you understand intellectually
and what you feel are two different@0003
things.@0003
@000CRight.@0003
My feelings don't agree
with what I understand.@0003
And then I start to get mad and
I feel like telling him about it.@0003
@0009Then do so!@0003
Keeping it inside of you is
bad for your health.@0003
And besides, you are at a
stressful position.@0003
No one would get angry if you
spill it out once in a while.@0003
@000CYou think so?@0003
@0009Of course!@0003
If you want, I can go talk to the
person.@0003
Even if the whole world turns against
you, I will always be at your side.@0003
@000C@0017Ah, okay.
Thanks Wolt.@0003
I feel better now.@0003
All right!
We have to get moving!@0003
@0009Exactly, Master Roy!@0003
@0017...By the way, I can tell the
person you're mad at and have a@0003
little discussion with him...@0003
@000C@0017No, it's all right now.@0003
@0009@0017Really?
...Who was it?@0003
@000C@0017He's closer than you think.@0003
@0009@0017What? Where?@0003
.......
...Is it...me?@0003
@000C@0017Yup!@0003
@0009@0017Master Roy!@0003
[0315]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@0102
@0009Roy,
how should I move next?@0003
@000COh, yes.@0003
You should...
...um...@0003
@0009What's the matter?@0003
@000CNo, it's just that...
It feels strange to give you orders...@0003
@0009Why?@0003
You are this army's leader.
You are supposed to give orders.@0003
@000CThat's true, but...@0003
@0009@0017Roy, you mustn't soften up.@0003
If the leader gets soft, so
do the troops.@0003
You are the general leading 
this army, and I am a squad@0003
leader in your army.@0003
So you must be strict, as a
general should be.@0003

@000CY-Yes!@0003
@0009@0017Good.@0003
Now, General Roy,
what is my next move?@0003
[0316]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@0102@000CPhew...@0003
@0009@0017Roy.@0003
@000C@0017Oh, General Cecilia.@0003
@0009@0017Are you tired?
Perhaps you should rest.@0003
@000C@0017No, I can't.
We must keep moving.@0003
@0009@0017Rushing will only
bring failure.@0003
@000CI'm not rushing.@0003
I won't try anything impossible.
But we must move as quickly as we can.@0003
@0009Why?@0003
@000CThe quicker we move,
we can reach more people in need.@0003
Right?@0003
@0009...Yes, that's true.@0003
@000CWe are fighting to win this war.@0003
However, if we focus only on winning,

and ignore those people need help,@0003
is that a true victory?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Oh, I'm sorry...
I shouldn't be so outspoken.@0003
Have I angered you?@0003
@0009@0017No, I'm glad.
I was too focused on winning the battle.@0003
You are already becoming a great leader.@0003
@000C@0017Please...@0003
@0017But...hearing that from
you is encouraging.@0003
@0009Really?
That's nice to hear.@0003
[0317]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@0102@000CWhat are you going to do
after this war is over?@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
@0017Do you already think
you've won?@0003
@000C@0017No...
That's not the case.@0003
@0009@0017Well...@0003
We must rebuild Etruria,
so I will return there first.@0003
Why do you ask?@0003
@000CI was just wondering if@0017 you could teach
me again once the war has ended.@0003
@0009Like the time in Ostia?@0003
@000CYes!@0003
@0009Well...@0003
There's no need for that anymore.
You have become a wonderful leader.@0003
There is nothing more I can teach
you.@0003
@000C@0017But...@0003
@0009@0017Roy, you must have confidence.@0003
Troops will not follow a leader who
does not even have confidence in himself.@0003
@000C@0017...Yes.@0003
@0009@0017That is the last thing
I can teach you.@0003
From now on, you are not
my student.@0003
You are my colleague and
friend.@0003
If there's anything I can
help you with after the war,@0003
I would be glad to assist you.@0003
@000CReally?@0003
@0009Of course.@0003
I will always be on your side.
Never forget that.@0003
[0318]
@0009@0010@012D@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Master Roy...@0003
@000C@0017Sophia?@0003
What's the matter?@0003
@0009@0017Today...
You shouldn't strain yourself...@0003
@000C@0017What do you mean?@0003
@0009@0017In battle...
There is a bad omen...@0003
Please stay out of the front lines...@0003
@000C!@0005
...All right.@0003
But I don't think I can follow
your warning.@0003
@0009... Why?@0003
@000CWhen I go up front...
It's because I trust the others.@0003
I can't be hiding in the back,
fearing injury.@0003
I have to fight alongside the
others.@0003
@0009Oh...I...@0003
@000C@0017Thanks for warning me,
but...I'm sorry.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
[0319]
@0009@0010@012D@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Master Roy...@0003
@000C@0017Sophia?
Did you feel something again?@0003
@0009@0017No...
I just wanted to apologize...@0003
@000CApologize?
To me?@0003
@0009About the other day...@0003
I told you that I could sense a bad
omen in the middle of a battle...@0003
@000COh, that...@0003
@0009I'm sorry...@0003
You have such a burden...
And I said something...@0003
that would worry you more...@0003
@000C@0017No, it's all right.@0003
I'm actually glad that you told
me.@0003
I was more careful that time.
Thank you.@0003
@0009@0017?...@0003
@000C@0017If you hadn't told me that,@0003
I probably wouldn't have been as
careful as I had.@0003
I could have been hurt badly.@0003
So thanks.@0003
@0009@0017But...I...@0003
@000C@0017So if you sense something from
now on, can you tell me?@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
[031A]
@0009@0010@012D@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Master Roy...
I must tell you something...@0003
@000C@0017What's the matter?@0003
@0009@0017My power...
It is not very strong...@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009I can see the future...
But it is only a vague image...@0003
Something truly powerful...
I cannot see...@0003
I just wanted to tell you...@0003
@000CSomething truly powerful?@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
If I could not sense something
very powerful...and if you were@0003
to be hurt because of it...
I...@0003
@000C@0017Thanks.
But I'll be fine.@0003
When the time comes, we'll
manage to do something about it.@0003
@0009@0017But...@0003
@000C@0017Sensing the future is an
amazing thing.@0003
We could prevent disasters
before they even occur.@0003
But I won't be too reliant on
your power, so don't worry.@0003
@0009@0017Yes...@0003
@000C@0017I want to see you smile more
than your power.@0003
I'm sure we'll face more hardships
as we go along...@0003
But the least we could do is keep
our spirits up, right?@0003
Let's go!@0003
@0009Yes...
Thank you...Master Roy...@0003
[031B]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Phew, I've finished outlining
the troops' positions...@0003
@0009Master Roy.@0003
@000C!?@0003
Oh, Sue.@0003
@0009What's the matter?
You have a strange look on your face.@0003
@000C@0017No, it's just that I was a little surprised
that you came up and spoke to me.@0003
@0009@0017Oh?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah...@0003
I never see you speaking
with other people.@0003
You don't like talking
that much?@0003
@0009@0017That's not the case.@0003
@000C@0017It isn't?@0003
@0009@0017It's just that I like talking with
other things more.@0003
@000COther things?@0003
@0009The breeze, the trees,
the sky, the brooks...@0003
They are all speaking
to us.@0003
@000CThey are?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
If you listen, you'll hear
them.@0003
You can't hear them because
you're not listening.@0003
See you.@0003
@000CHuh?@0003
I thought you had
something to tell me...@0003
@0009I just did.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009Be sure to listen to nature,
and you'll hear all sorts of voices.@0003
You'll feel better after that.
If you're stressed all the time,@0003
you won't be able to hear anything.@0003
@000CSue...@0009@0011@0003
@000CWas she trying to cheer me up
because I was tired...?@0003
[031C]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0102@000CSue.@0003
@0009@0017Master Roy?@0003
@000C@0017Thanks for cheering
me up the other day.@0003
@0009...You look better.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009Your feel...
It's become better.@0003
@000CMy feel?
What do you mean?@0003
@0009It has become softer.@0003
@000CDo you think so?
I can't really tell.@0003
@0009Perhaps things like these cannot be
recognized by those who work the@0003
land as compared to those who run
through it.@0003
@000C....@0003
@0009What is it?@0003
@000CIt's the first time
I've seen you smile.@0003
@0009@0017Really?@0003
@000C@0017Yes.@0003
Your smile has a good 'feel'
to it too.@0003
@0009...
Thank you.@0003
[031D]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0102
@000CWhat are you going to do
when this war is over?@0003
@0009I'll return to Sacae.@0003
@000CBut the Kutolah clan
was destroyed by Bern...@0003
@0009We'll gather everyone together again.@0003
Perhaps there is no more Kutolah clan,
but not everyone in the Kutolah is dead.@0003
@000CWell...
I guess that's right.@0003
@0009Why do you ask?@0003
@000CI was just thinking that if you
don't have any place to go, you@0003
can come to Pherae.@0003
@0009Pherae...
Your hometown.@0003
@000CRight...@0003
It's not a huge city, but it's
a nice and peaceful place.@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
But my heart is in the
plains of Sacae.@0003
@000COh, okay.@0003
But if you ever change your
mind, just tell me.@0003
@0009Master Roy.@0003
@000CYes?@0003
@0009Thanks for cheering me up.@0003
@000CYou're very welcome.@0003
[031E]
@0009@0010@0129@000C@0010@0102@0009What's the matter, Master Roy?
Do you need something?@0003
@000CNo.@0003
I was just thinking that you seem
so...free of worries.@0003
@0009@0017Hey!
...Are you making fun of me?@0003
@000C@0017No!
I'm envious.@0003
@0009@0017...I still think I'm being
made fun of.@0003
@000C@0017No, I'm not making fun of you.@0003
You see, I have to always show people
that I'm happy and confident because@0003
I'm the leader.@0003
But I often get depressed or become
worried.@0003
Oh, I wanted to ask you, is there
some kind of tip that you can give@0003
me to stay happy like that?@0003
@0009Tip?@0003
@000CYou know, something to do or a
certain mindset you should be in,@0003
or something.@0003
@0009Well...@0003
Eat well, sleep well,
and laugh well.@0003
@000C@0017...Is that all?@0003
@0009@0017Probably.@0003
That's all you need to enjoy
life, right?@0003
@000C@0017Well...
Maybe.@0003
@0009@0017I think you're thinking
too deeply.@0003
Well, probably, you have to because
you're in such a position...@0003
Anyway, I don't think it's as
complicated as you think.@0003
[031F]
@0009@0010@0129@000C@0010@0102@000CYou said you're a Pegasus Knight
in training, right?@0003
@0009Right.@0003
@000CHow come you're in an army
outside Ilia?@0003
@0009It's the rule.@0003
If you fight outside Ilia, you'll gain
things you wouldn't be able to inside.@0003
@000CLike what?@0003
@0009Foreign fighting styles,
foreign culture...@0003
And of course, money.@0003
@000C@0017I see...@0003
Then wouldn't it be a hindrance
if you stay in this army so long?@0003
@0009@0017Huh?
No, of course not!@0003
There's no other army that's traveling
all over the place like this.@0003
It's great training.@0003
@000C@0017Really?
Okay, then.@0003
@0009@0017...
Were you worried about me?@0003
@000CWell, I guess so.@0003
@0009Thanks!@0003
[0320]
@0009@0010@0129@000C@0010@0102
@000CThany, what are you going to do
when this war is over?@0003
@0009Me?@0003
Well... First off, I'll
probably go back to Ilia.@0003
@000C@0017Oh...
I see.@0003
@0009@0017Why?@0003
@000COh, I was just wondering if you
wanted to come to Pherae.@0003
@0009Your hometown?
I'd love to!@0003
I wanted to see it once.@0003
@000CWell, it's not a huge city like
Ostia, so you might be disappointed.@0003
@0009My hometown is probably more
countryside than yours.@0003
Plus it snows a lot.@0003
@000CThen everything's fine, then.@0003
@0009I'll look forward to going.@0003
@000CSure.@0003
If you like it, you can stay
as long as you want.@0003
@0009Thanks!@0003
@000C@0011
@0009Master Roy is so nice...@0003
Inviting a mercenary like me to his
hometown, and saying I can stay as@0003
long as I want..@0003
Wait...
Does that mean...?@0003
No no, don't get cocky...
But still...hmm...@0003
[0321]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0102@001C@0009@0080@000DRoy!@0003@001C
@000C@0017@0080@000FWha-!?@0003
@000DL-Lalum...!@0003
@000B@0017I'm glad I found you!
I want to show you something.@0003
@001C@000DW-Wait!
Calm down first...@0003@001C@000B@0080@000B
@000DSo...What was it you wanted?@0003
@001C@0009@0080@000DSooo!@0003@001C
@000DWait wait!
I can hear you from here!@0003@001C@000B@0080@000B@000D@0080@000E@001C
@0009I've come up with
a new dance,@0003
and I want you to see it.
It goes like this...@0003@0002
Well?
Well?@0003
What do you think?@0003
@000C@0017That's very nice.
I think you're a very good dancer.@0003
@0009...Is that it?@0003
@000CHuh?@0003
@0009@0017You know...
Isn't there more?@0003
Like, 'You look beautiful' or
'Your hair looks great today'@0003
or something...@0003
@000C@0017Uhm...
I better get going...@0003
@0009Already?@0003
@000CSorry...@0003@0011
@0009Hey!@0003
[0322]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0102
@001C@0009@0080@000DRoy!@0003@001C
@000C@0080@000FL-Lalum...!@0003
I don't think you should on to
people like that so much...@0003
People might have misunderstandings.@0003
@001C
@000B@0017But Roy...
...@0003@0002
!?@0003@001C
@000D?@0003@001C
@000B@0017Eeek!
There's an enemy!@0003@001C
@000D@0017Enemy!?
Where!@0003@001C
@000B@0017I don't know!
But I heard the bushes rustle..@0003@001C
@000D@0017L-Lalum!
Calm down...@0003
I can't move if you're grabbing
on to me like that...@0003@001C
@000B@0017I'm going to die!
But...it's okay.@0003
If I can die for Master Roy,
it would be my only wish now.@0003
You, hiding over there!
Come out!@0003
Our love is eternal,
and can never be broken!@0003
@001C
@000D@0017P-Please, can you get
off of me so I can fight..@0003
[0323]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0102
@0009Roy!@0003
@000C@0017Lalum...@0003
@0009@0017There you are!
I have another dance to show you.@0003
@000C@0017Y-Yeah...@0003
@0009Roy...?@0003
Are you...trying to avoid
me?@0003
@000CAh...@0003
N-No!
Not at all.@0003
@0009Yes you are.@0003
As soon as I came,
you stepped back.@0003
You're already prepared
to dodge.@0003
@000CY-You're imagining things.@0003
@0009Your eyes are wandering...@0003
@000CS-So...@0003
@0009...
You don't like me...@0003
You don't want to see my dancing
at all!@0003
That's it!@0003
@000CT-That's not true!!@0003
@001C@0009@0080@000D@0017Really!?
Thanks!@0003@001C
@000C@0080@000F@0017Whoa!@0003
[0324]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0118
@0009@0017Hmmm....@0003
@000CMaster Roy,
is something wrong?@0003
@0009@0016.....@0003
@000C@0016Master Roy!@0003
@0009Oh!
Alan.@0003
Sorry, I was lost in my thoughts.@0003
@000CYou seem to be thinking a lot
these days, Master Roy.@0003
@0009Maybe so...@0003
@000CWhat are you
worrying over?@0003
@0009I was just thinking how
to move our troops.@0003
@000CHow to move the troops?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
The enemy is growing stronger all the time,
so good methods quickly become obsolete.@0003
I was wondering how to effectively break
through their defense lines.@0003
@000CThat's easy, Master Roy!
Leave it to me.@0003
I shall have their defense
shattered in no time!@0003
@0009Thanks.@0003
But I don't want to put anyone
in danger either.@0003
There has to be a better way...
I'll think some more.@0003
[0325]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0118
@000C@0017Master Roy, I have an idea
to break the enemy's defense...@0003
@0009Idea?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
First, we save our best troops and use the
others to clash with the enemy's front lines.@0003
Then we shall find a weakness.@0003
Please, leave that role to me
and my squad!@0003
@0009But that group will be
in great danger...@0003
@000CWe might have some casualties,
but we can win the battle!@0003
Besides, I am not so easily
defeated.@0003
@0009...Alan,
I can't consider that idea.@0003
@000CW-Why?@0003
@0009I can't use a plan that we know
will have casualties.@0003
@000CBut Master Roy, casualties
cannot be avoided in a war...@0003
@0009...I think they can be.@0003
I might sound naive, but I don't
consider a victory with casualties@0003
to be a true victory.@0003
@000CA true victory...@0003
Can there be truth in a victory
of war?@0003
@0009I think there can be.@0003
That's why I want to come up
with a good plan.@0003

[0326]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0118
@0009@0017Hmm...@0003
@000CStill thinking,
Master Roy?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
I can't think of a good plan yet...
But not your plan, okay?@0003
@000CYes, I understand,
Master Roy.@0003
But if there's anything I can do,
please tell me.@0003
@0009Yes, I will.@0003
@000C...Master Roy.@0003
@0009Yes?@0003
@000C...I honestly still cannot decide whether
there is such a thing as true victory.@0003
But if you believe it, then I will
support you with all my strength.@0003
@0017@0009Thanks, Alan.@0003
I'm sure there will come a day when
you'll understand.@0003
@000CThen I shall look forward
to that day!@0003
[0327]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@0102@0009@0012@0017Master Roy!
Are you all right?@0003
@000C@0017Lance?
What's the matter?@0003
@0009@0017I...couldn't see you,
so...@0003
@000C@0017Oh.
Is that all.@0003
@0009No, that is not all,
Master Roy.@0003
You are this army's leader.
You must watch for your safety more.@0003
@000CYeah, you're right.
I'll be more careful.@0003
@0009Are you sure?@0003
@000CI promise.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
[0328]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017Master Roy, if I may
suggest something.@0003
@000C@0017What is it?@0003
@0009@0017How about if you stay out of the
front lines for a while?@0003
@000C@0017Well...@0003
@0009I know what you are thinking,
but please understand.@0003
An army's leader is crucial.@0003
If the leader is lost, so is
the battle.@0003
@000CThat's true...@0003
@0009Then...@0005@0003
@000CBut I don't think anyone would listen
to me if I only keep myself safe and@0003
start telling people what to do.@0003
@0009That's not true!@0003
@000CI'm not particularly smart, and I
don't have much charisma either.@0003
So I have to gain trust by experiencing
the pain that everyone else is...@0003
@0009Master Roy...@0003
@000CPerhaps I'm not meant to be a leader.@0003
Perhaps it's just how I am.@0003
[0329]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@0102@000CLance, I've been thinking about what
you said, but I still think that I@0003
should stay up front.@0003
I know you were suggesting it for
my sake, but...@0003
@0009No, perhaps I was too focused on my own
opinions.@0003
If you believe that your way is the best,
then it is best to pursue that path.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Thanks.@0003
It's encouraging to hear you
say that.@0003
@0009@0017However, you made one mistake
the other day.@0003
@000C@0012I did?@0003
@0009@0013You said, "I'm not particularly smart,
and I don't have much charisma either."@0003
@000C@0012Yes, I did say that.@0003
@0009@0013That's the part about you that people
like.@0003
No one would give his life to someone
who has no charisma at all.@0003
@000C...Do you think so?@0003
@0009@0014Of course.@0003
If I may also add a comment, be sure
to keep that pure heart.@0003
As long as you do, our troops will
follow you.@0003
@000C@0013@0017I'll try.
Thank you, Lance.@0003
@0009@0013I am glad to be of
assistance.@0003
[032A]
@0009@0010@010D@000C@0010@0103@000CAhh!
Klein!@0003
@0009@0017W-What!
What's wrong, Clarine?@0003
@000C@0017You look wonderful in that
outfit today!@0003
@0009@0017And I was wondering what in the world
happened when you screamed like that...@0003
Is that all?@0003
@000C@0017But Klein!@0003
In this army, everyone is just so
aesthetically handicapped!@0003
You truly shine when you are among
them, Klein!@0003
@0009@0017Clarine, you only think that
because I'm your family...@0003
@000C@0017No!@0003
There is no one else in the world who could
match you.@0003
Perhaps General Percival has more authority,
but you will always be most beautiful!@0003
@0009@0017...Clarine, a fine lady wouldn't
say things like that.@0003
@000CBut it is true.@0003
@0009...Clarine.@0003
@000C@0017But I will try harder
if you tell me to.@0003
@0009@0017Yes, do so.@0003
[032B]
@0009@0010@010D@000C@0010@0103
@0009@0017Clarine, come over here.@0003
@000C@0017Oh, Klein?
How do you fare today?@0003
@0009@0017Not too well, I'm afraid.@0003
@000C?
Is something wrong?@0003
@0009Is true that you said harsh things
to the cleric and made her cry?@0003
@000C@0017No, I did not make her cry.
She is the one who just stared crying.@0003
@0009@0017...So it's true that she
did cry.@0003
@000CIt is her fault!
She was sucking up to you.@0003
@0009What do you mean?@0003
@000CShe was healing your wounds
before I got the chance.@0003
@0009Clarine!@0003
@000CBut I wanted to heal your injuries
so that you would be proud of me@0003
and would say that I was being a
great help, and...@0003
@0009...But I was proud of you.@0003
I was thinking that my naive little
sister's so grown up now...@0003
But now that you've done this...@0003
@000CI-I'll never do it again!@0003
Please don't hate me, Klein!@0003
@0009What are you talking about.
I'll never hate you.@0003
@000C@0017Oh, thank you, Klein!@0003
[032C]
@0009@0010@010D@000C@0010@0103@0009@0017What's wrong, Clarine?
You look sad.@0003
@000CI... I don't want to go back to
the mansion after the war...@0003
@0009Why?@0003
Father and Mother are anxious
for us to return.@0003
@000CI want to meet Father and Mother...@0003
But if I return to the mansion,
I would just be a doll again.@0003
I would never see the outside world,
and I would only be concerned@0003
about decorating myself...@0003
@0009Well, that is how most Etrurian
ladies are.@0003
@000CYes, I know...@0003
But becoming the most elegant in
Etruria does not seem as appealing@0003
as it once did.@0003
@0009That's because you're growing up
and maturing, Clarine.@0003
If you stay at the mansion, you could just
live your life without doing anything.@0003
@000CBut it would be so horribly
boring!@0003
@0009@0017Yes, indeed...
All right, then here's what we will do.@0003
Once this war is over, we will first
go back home and show Father and Mother@0003
that we are safe and well.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
@0009Then we can discuss your future
and what you want to do.@0003
@000COh, I already know what I want
to do!@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
@000C@0017I will become a Sorcery General
like General Cecilia!@0003
@0009@0017Um...
Are you serious?@0003
@000C@0017Of course!@0003
As the Sorcery General, I will help your
work as the Archery General, and then we@0003
shall always be together!@0003
@0009@0017Clarine...let's try and be
a little more realistic...@0003
@000C@0017Oh, it would be so wonderful to see
us both in the elegant uniform@0003
of the Etrurian Generals...@0003
@0009@0017Clarine...@0003
Well, you're still a little
girl, I see.@0003
@000C@0017Did you say something?@0003
@0009@0017No, nothing.@0003
[032D]
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0103@000COh!
We certainly do meet a lot.@0003
@0009@0017...You again?@0003
@000CMy name is not 'you.'
I am Clarine.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016@0017I have always wanted to tell
you something.@0003
@0009@0016@0017?@0003
@000C@0016@0017It is about how you look.@0003
@0009@0016@0017??@0003
@000C@0016@0017You actually do have quite an attractive
face.@0003
Of course, it would come nowhere near
my beloved brother Klein, but you are@0003
quite impressive for a commoner.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Therefore, I can use my advanced
Etrurian esthetic sense and make you@0003
into a truly handsome noble...@0003
@0009@0011
@000C@0017Oh! Wait!
Where did he go?@0003
I was not finished speaking to him!
So he is just a tramp after all!@0003
[032E]
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0103@000C@0017There you are!
I won't let you go this time!@0003
@0009...Knock it off.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
That is no way to respond
to someone's kindness!@0003
@0009You're starting to get on
my nerves.@0003
@000C!!
Insulting a lady like that...@0003
That...is not how a proper
Gentleman...should act...@0003
@0009@0016.....@0003
@000C... ...@0003
@0009@0016...All right, I'm sorry.
...Don't cry.@0003
@000CI-I'm not...!@0003
@0009@0016.....@0003@0011
@000C@0016...I know he is not to blame...
But why am I acting this way...?@0003
[032F]
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0103@0009@0017... Hey.@0003
@000COh...@0003
@0009You dropped this.@0003
@000CWhat?
Oh, my ribbon...@0003
@0017You brought it to me.
Thank you.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Um...@0003
I just realized...
I don't know your name...@0003
Would you please tell me your name,
if it would not be any trouble?@0003
@0009@0017...Rutger.@0003
@000CRutger...@0003
I never even thanked you for
saving me...@0003
It is no wonder you don't
like me...@0003
@0009@0016.....@0016@0003
@000C@0017Thank you for rescuing me that
time...@0003
I know it is already too late,
but if you would accept my thanks..@0003
@0009@0017...Not like you.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009Don't try something you're
not used to.@0003
You're good at screaming,
so why don't you do it?@0003
@000CWh-What!?
What do you mean by that!?@0003
@0009@0017There you go...
That's more like you.@0003
Come like that and make me
laugh once in a while, Clarine.@0003
@000C@0017!!@0003
@0009@0011
@000CRutger...@0003
[0330]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@0103
@000CExcuse me,
would you mind sitting still?@0003
I'll heal your wounds for you...@0003
@0009@0017What's a kid like you doing
in the battlefield?@0003
@000C!!@0003
@0009Are you lost?
Where are your parents?@0003
@000C!!!!
You infidel!@0003
Do you have any idea who...@0003
@0009@0017Yeah yeah, you're some kid of
some high rank nobility, right?@0003
That still doesn't explain
why you're here, though.@0003
@000C@0017!!!
You filthy...!@0003
Listen in awe!@0003
I am Clarine of the Reglay family
of Etruria!@0003
@0009What?
Then you're Lord Pent's...@0003
@000C@0017Do you know my father?@0003
@0009@0017Klein's little sister...@0003
@000C!
You know Klein too!?@0003
Who...are you...?@0003
@0009No, it's nothing.
Forget it.@0003
@000CNo, it's not nothing!@0003
@0009Clarine, was it?
Be careful out there.@0003@0011
@000CWhat!?
Wait!@0003
...
Who is he...?@0003
[0331]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@0103
@000C@0017...So I'm telling you to speak!
Who are you?@0003
Keeping quiet won't benefit you
in any way!@0003
@0009Don't you ever shut up?
Gimme a break, kid...@0003
@000CMy name is Clarine!@0003
@0009@0017Fine.@0003
Well, Miss Clarine, I don't really
approve of girls going around chasing@0003
after guys' asses.@0003
@000C@0017What!?
You have such a foul mouth...!@0003
@0009@0017Exactly.@0003
You don't want to be around
someone like me, now, do you?@0003
@000C@0017...I will not be fooled.
You are just trying to drive me away.@0003
@0009Geez, she's not cute at all...
Are you really part of that family?@0003
@000C@0017That's it!
I want to ask about my brother!@0003
@0009@0017Dammit, I'm falling into her pace!
Cunning kid...@0003
@000CMy name is Clarine!@0003
@0009@0011
@000CWait!
Wait, I say!@0003
[0332]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@0103
@0009@0017...All right, you win.
I'll tell you.@0003
So just stop following me everywhere..@0003
@000C@0017Finally, we understand each other.
Please begin, I am listening.@0003
@0009@0017It's really not that big of a deal...@0003
It's just that I once worked for your
family as a pit fighter.@0003
@000C!?
Then...@0003
Are you Dieck?@0003
@0009Yeah?@0003
@000C@0017Really?
I always wanted to meet you, Dieck!@0003
@0009@0017What's that supposed to mean?@0003
@000C@0017You saved my brother's life!@0003
@0009@0017Who told you?@0003
@000C@0017Everyone!
My father, my mother, my brother...@0003
I grew up hearing all these good

things about you.@0003
@0009@0016.....@0003
@000C@0016When you left, I was still little...@0003
I remember that I always regretted
not being able to see you.@0003
But now, here we are!@0003
@0009@0017I see...
Well, now you've seen me.@0003
Satisfied?@0003
@000C@0017Yes.@0003
@0009Good.@0003
Then you'll stop hovering
around me wherever I go, right?@0003
@000COh, I'll follow you everywhere!@0003
@0009@0017What...@0003
@000C@0017If you saved my brother's life, then
that means you are an important person@0003
to me as well.@0003
And I want you to tell me what my
brother was like when he was young...@0003
@0009@0017...I don't think so.@0003@0011
@000C@0017Oh!
Wait, Dieck!@0003
I won't let you go!@0003
[0333]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@0103@000COh?
You are...@0003
@0009@0017Ah, you must be Lady Clarine,
princess of the Reglay family.@0003
I am Lance, knight of Pherae.@0003
We are honored to have one of
your stature with our army.@0003
Please forgive any impudence you
may have experienced so far.@0003
We are in a war, and people are
uptight.@0003
@000C@0017Oh...@0003
Yes, I shall forgive that for you.
Understood?@0003
@000CThis is for you, and it
makes you very special!@0003
All right?@0003
@0009@0017Yes, thank you, my lady.
Now, let me take your hand...@0003
@000C@0017My...@0003
You have much respect for a
countryside knight.@0003
@0009@0017I am honored.@0003
@000C@0017O-Of course, you are still nothing
compared to our knights.@0003
@0009@0017Forgive my lack of prowess,
my lady.@0003
[0334]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@0103
@000CLance!@0003
@0009@0017Lady Clarine, is there something
I can get for you?@0003
@000C@0017As the princess of the Reglay family
I order you to protect me from now on.@0003
@0009@0017That means...@0003
@000C@0017You are a little weak to be defending
me, to tell the truth...@0003
But since we are in these conditions,
I will settle with you.@0003
You must stay by my side and defend me
at all times.@0003
Understood?@0003
@0009@0017If Master Roy orders it.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
I am ordering you!@0003
@0009If I may object, my lady, I cannot
follow those orders even if they@0003
are from you.@0003
A knight must serve his master,
and only his master.@0003
One who forgets that can no longer
be called a knight.@0003
@000CI...I know that!@0003
I was just testing your loyalty
as a knight!@0003
@0009Yes, my lady.
Forgive my rudeness.@0003
@000CW-Well, anyway, you have passed
the test.@0003
Be proud of it!@0003
[0335]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@0103
@000C@0017Lance!@0003
@0009Yes, Lady Clarine?@0003
@000CEven if you are not my knight...@0003
It is true that we are a princess and
a knight, am I correct?@0003
@0009Yes, of course, my lady.@0003
@000CT-Then...@0003
I shall hereby permit you to kiss
my hand.@0003
@0009Yes, thank you, my lady.@0003
@000CLance, you do understand, do you not?@0003
This is to make clear the difference
in our status.@0003
There is no more meaning to it than
that!@0003
@0009Yes, of course, my lady.@0003
@000CYes...
Of course...@0003
You could be a little more...
disappointed...@0003
@0009Did you say something,
my lady?@0003
@000CN-No!
Nothing!@0003
[0336]
@0009@0010@0103@000C@0010@010C@0009@0017Oh?
You...@0003
@000CMe? Yes?@0003
@0009Why are you dressing yourself
in men's clothes?@0003
@000CIs it strange...?@0003
@0009Of course!
A lady must be wearing elegant dresses.@0003
A true lady must be dressed properly@0003
when they fight.@0003
@000CReally...?
No, I suppose you're right.@0003
I don't know anything about
such matters...
@0009Hm...I see.@0003
@0017Well then, I suppose I can
teach you everything I know.@0003
@000CWhat? N-No!@0003
I wouldn't do well in such things...@0003
@0009@0017Don't be ridiculous!
A lady must always be beautiful.@0003
No gentleman will ever at you
if you look like that!@0003
@000CD-Do you think so...@0003
Well...she is offering to help me...
All right!@0003
@0017Please teach me, Lady Clarine!

[0337]
@0009@0010@0103@000C@0010@010C@0009So...
Dorothy, what do you usually do?@0003
@000CWell, I'm pretty busy outside
the battlefield.@0003
I help cook meals and stuff...@0003
@0009@0017What?!@0003
You can leave dirty jobs like
that to that lowly Merlinus person!@0003
@000CL-Lowly?
Master Merlinus is lowly?@0003
@0009@0017How do you take care of
your hair?@0003
@000CI wash it with water.@0003
@0009@0017What!?
I can't believe it...!@0003
Here, use this.@0003
You must wash your hair with it
@0017three times a day!@0003
Understood?
@000C@0017T-Three times?@0003
Well...
It looks really expensive...@0003
I appreciate it, but it would
be wasteful if I used it.@0003
@0009What are you saying!
I am offering it to you.@0003
Go ahead, take it.@0003
@000COh...
Well, thank you, then.@0003
@0009Also...
You should change the way you speak.@0003
@0017Could you not speak more like me,
with a refined and elegant tone?@0003
@000C@0017Um...okay...@0003
@0017Oh, what a beautiful day it is!@0003
@0017Would you care for a cup of tea
and crumpets?@0003
@0009...This will take a lot of work...
Well, first, you must learn how@0003
to take care of your hair, how
to choose your dresses, dance@0003
steps, how to turn down offers
from men...@0003
@000CThat much!?@0003
@0009There is more.
You mustn't give up so easily!@0003
The way to a refined lady
is a tough one indeed!@0003
@000CWell...@0003
[0338]
@0009@0010@0103@000C@0010@010C
@000C@0017Um...Lady Clarine?@0003
@0009Yes?@0003
@000CI've been trying really hard to
be a lady, but...@0003
Nothing seems to have changed.@0003
No one seems to be noticing.
So maybe I should just give up...@0003
@0009Well...@0003
@000CI'm sorry!
I know you were just trying to help me...@0003
But it's not your fault!@0003
You know, with me, the base isn't very
good...@0003
@0009Dorothy!@0003
That is what's wrong with you!@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009Listen to me.@0003
A fine lady must have confidence in herself.@0003
No matter how much you dress up, if you do
not have faith in yourself, it will all be@0003
in vain.@0003
You must not degrade yourself like that.@0003
Understood?@0003
@000CY-Yes.@0003
@0009@0017Have confidence in yourself!
It is me who is teaching you.@0003
Of course you will
become a fine lady one day!@0003
@000C...Yes, thank you,
Lady Clarine...@0003
@0009@0017...And...@0003
We are friends now,
@0017are we not?@0003
@000C@0017Eh?@0003
@0009@0017Don't call me 'Lady' Clarine.
Just call me Clarine.@0003
@000C@0017Oh, right.
Okay then, thanks, Clarine!@0003
@0009...A-Ahem!
Today we shall go over how to drink tea!@0003
@000CAll right!@0003
[0339]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@012D
@0009@0017@0016......@0003
@000C...?@0003
@0009......@0003
@000C@0016Fa?
...What are you looking at...?@0003
@0009You grew up a little.@0003
@000CR-Really...?@0003
@0009Yeah.@0003
Why, why?
Fa always stay the same!@0003
You were the same as Fa before!@0003
@000CYes...@0003
I am half Dragon...
so I grow slowly...@0003
But you... grow even
more slowly than me...@0003
@0009Why does Fa stay little?
Why doesn't she grow up like you?@0003
@000CYou are a full-blooded Dragon...@0003
A Dragon's lifespan...is close to
eternity...@0003
I have human blood in me...so I
grow at a different speed than you...@0003
Do you understand...?@0003
@0009No...@0003
@000CYou'll understand...@0003
When you grow up...@0003
@0009@0017When will Fa grow up?
Soon?@0003
@000C@0017Yes...@0003
@0009@0017Yay!@0003
[033A]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@012D
@0009@0017Hmmmmm...@0003
@000C@0016...?@0016@0003
@0009Hmmmm...@0003
Sophia, when is Fa gonna
grow up?@0003
@000CWell...@0003
@0009Fa's not growing at all...
Fa wants to be a grown up!@0003
@000CBut...
You can live...for a very long time...@0003
Even when I become old and die...you
will still live on...@0003
@0009!?@0003
No! No no no!
You won't die!@0003
Nooooo!!@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Waaaaah...@0003
@000CFa...I'm sorry...
Don't cry...@0003
I feel the same way you do...@0003
But...@0003
That is what it means...
to live for eternity.@0003
[033B]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@012D
@0009Sophia?@0003
@000C@0017Yes...?@0003
@0009@0017Um...@0003
@000C@0017Yes...@0003
@0009Fa was scared that you would grow up and
not want to play with her anymore...@0003
Fa always wants to be with you!
Fa wants to play hide-and-seek and tag@0003
@0017and lots of other fun games.@0003
@000C@0017Fa...@0003
Don't worry...
I'll always...be your friend...@0003
I'll always be with you...
All right...?@0003
@0009@0017Really!? Yay!@0003
@000C@0017Yes...@0003
We'll always...
be together...@0003
[033C]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@011B
@000CFa.@0003
@0009Igrene!@0003
Look, look!
A butterfly!!@0003
@000C@0017Fa, shouldn't you be doing
something else?@0003
Didn't Master Roy give you
an order to do?@0003
@0009Roy's orders are no fun.@0003
@000CFa, you should be doing
what you're told.@0003
@0009Aww...@0003
But Fa doesn't want to.@0003
@000CFa.@0003
@0009...Er...@0003
@000CSay sorry.@0003
@0009...Fa's sorry.@0003
@000CLook, Fa.@0003
You promised Roy you would
do what he asked, right?@0003
If you make a promise,
you have to keep it.@0003
Okay?@0003
@0009Okay...@0003
@000C@0017Good girl.@0003
Well then, let's go.@0003
@0009Yeah.@0003
[033D]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@011B
@000CCome here, Fa.
I'll braid your hair for you.@0003
@0009Yay!@0003
@000CDo you like having
your hair touched, Fa?@0003
@0009Yes!@0003
...Igrene,
is Fa gonna get pretty?@0003
@000CYes.
You have such lovely hair...@0003
You'll become very, very beautiful
when you grow up.@0003
@0009Like you?@0003
@000CWell...I suppose.@0003
@0009Yay!@0003
Hey, Igrene?@0003
@000C@0017Fa, hold still.@0003
@0009Okay.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016What's wrong?@0003
Do your hands hurt?@0003
@000COh, I'm sorry...@0003
I was just remembering my daughter.@0003
She was a very attractive little girl,
much like you.@0003
@0009What happened to her?@0003
@000CShe's gone...
She went to a faraway place.@0003
[033E]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@011B
@0009Igrene!@0003
@000CYes, Fa?@0003
@0009You were talking about your
little girl the other day.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
@0009I know her.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009She came to play with Fa.@0003
When Fa was all alone in her room,
she came with Sophia to play and@0003
and tell Fa about the outside.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016She said you were the
'Guardian'.@0003
@000C@0017I see...@0003
@0009But...@0003
She stopped coming to play
with Fa.@0003
Fa asked Sophia about her,
but she wouldn't tell.@0003
Is it Fa's fault?@0003
Was Fa a bad girl to her?@0003
Did Fa make her angry and
go to the faraway place?@0003
@000CNo...that's not the case.
She was never mad at you, Fa.@0003
She just can't play with you
anymore, but...@0003
She'll always be very fond of
of you, Fa.@0003
@0009Really?@0003
@000CYes...of course.@0003
[033F]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0106
@0009La la laaa...
Oh! It's Sue!@0003
@000CYou look like you're having
lots of fun, Fa.@0003
@0009Yes,@0003
Fa's having lots
and lots of fun!@0003
@000CIs that what's fun?@0003
@0009Yeah.@0003
Fa was never allowed
to play outside before.@0003
@000C@0017Never...?
You always stayed indoors?@0003
@0009@0017Uh-huh.@0003
@000C@0017I...see.@0003
@0009@0017La la la laa...@0003@0011
@000C@0017Always inside...@0003
She never knew the blessing of the
sky or the warmth of the Earth...@0003
[0340]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0106@0009Sue!@0003
@000CWhat's wrong, Fa?@0003
@0009Can Fa ride on your horse
some time?@0003
@000CMy horse?
Of course, you can ride her now...@0003
@0009No, not now.
Roy told Fa not to bug the others!@0003
@000C@0017I see...@0003
@0009@0017Yeah.@0003
There's a place Fa wants to go
on the horse!@0003
@000C@0017Where?@0003
@0009@0017A place with lots of pretty flowers!@0003
Or a place where the sun's shining
and it's all nice and warm!@0003
@000C@0017...All right.
We'll go sometime.@0003
@0009@0017Yay!
Thank you, Sue!@0003
[0341]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0106
@0009Sue!@0003
@000CFa?@0003
@0009Fa wants to go to lots
of other places, too!@0003
Fa wants to learn more
about the big outside world.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Sue...@0003
@000C@0017Yes...@0003
@0017Once this war is over, we can
go to many different places.@0003
@0009Really?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
There are many things in this world
that have been nurtured by the Sky's@0003
blessings and the Earth's warmth.
We can go see all those things.@0003
@0009Hmmmm...@0003
Fa doesn't get it.
@000CYou'll understand when you get a
little older.@0003
I know you will.@0003
[0342]
@0009@0010@0104La la laaa la...@0003
Oh...@0003@0002
A flower!@0003@0011@0006
@000C@0010@0124@0017So that is a Dragon...
Mankind's archenemy...@0003
@0017But something's...
strange...@0003
The Dragons in the old scrolls
weren't like that at all.@0003
They were much more...
inhuman.@0003
@0009@0010@0104Hm?@0003
@000C@0016...!@0003
@0009@0016Who are you?@0003
@000CM-Me?
...I am Niime.@0003
@0009Niime?@0003
@000CThat's right...@0003
Oh, I must be off.
I had things to do.@0003
@0011
@0009?@0003
[0343]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0124
@000CFa.@0003
@0009Granny Niime!@0003
@000CGranny, eh...@0003
You're actually several hundred
years older than I am.@0003
@0009?@0003
@000CWell, no matter.@0003
Fa,
take a look at this gemstone.@0003
@0009What is it?@0003
@000C@0017Once upon a time, humans and...
demons lived on this land.@0003
The demons used their immense power
to destroy the humans.@0003
The weak humans could do nothing
but watch as the bodies piled up...@0003
And then one day...@0003
Eight bright columns of light were
born that would defeat the demons.@0003
@0009@0017Were they pretty lights?@0003
@000C@0016Yes.@0003
@0016@0017...The humans used the lights to
fight against the demons.@0003
After a long and devastating battle...
the demons were finally defeated.@0003
But that wasn't the end...@0003
@0009Mmm... ... ...@0003
Fa's all sleepy now...@0003
@0011@000C@0016So...@0003
@0016@0017This is the enemy of mankind, eh?@0003
She doesn't seem to have a worry
in the world...@0003
...How cute...@0003
[0344]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0124@0009Granny Niime!@0003
@000CAh, hello, Fa.@0003
@0009@0017What's wrong?@0003
@000CHm...@0003
I told you the story of men
and demons the other day, right?@0003
@0009Um...@0003
@0017Yeah!
The pretty lights!@0003
@000C@0017To tell you the truth...
I was afraid of those demons.@0003
After I studied dark magic and
mankind's history...only then@0003
did I discover just how powerful
and terrifying the demons were.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah.@0003
@000C@0017But...@0003
After meeting you, my fear seems to
have just gone right out the window.@0003
@0009?@0003
@000C@0017It's nothing.@0003
Well, my long stories must be
boring you.@0003
Here.@0003
Go play with this.@0003
@0009Yay!@0003@0011@0007
@000C@0017What a fool I was...@0003
I was willing to do terrible things
to an innocent little girl for the@0003
peace and safety of our race...@0003
What was I thinking...@0003
There's no point in peace obtained
@0017through such hideous measures.@0003
[0345]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@012B@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016?
...Do you need something?@0003
@0009!
Ummm...@0003
What's that thing there?
It's making pretty noises.@0003
@000CThis is a harp.
Do you like how it sounds?@0003
@0009Yeah!
Fa really likes it!@0003
And...What's your name?@0003
@000CMy name is Elphin,
my cute little lady.@0003
@0009@0017Elf...?@0003
@000C@0017Elphin.@0003
@0009Elphin!@0003
@000CThat's right.@0003
@0009Fa likes you too, Elphin!@0003
Your hair blows in the wind, and it's like
gold when the sun's all shining on it!@0003
Fa likes pretty things like that!@0003
@000CWell, it is an honor.
Thank you.@0003
@0009Can Fa come and see you again?@0003
@000COf course.
Any time.@0003
[0346]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@012B@0009Elphin!@0003
@000CAh, the cute little lady from the
other day.@0003
Hello.@0003
@0009...Fa's name's not 'cute little lady'!@0003
@000COh, pardon me.
Then...may I call you Miss Fa?@0003
@0009Fa's name's not 'Missfa'!
It's Fa!@0003
@000CAs you wish, Fa.
Fa...the name has a unique feel to it.@0003
Is it your real name?@0003
@0009No, Fa's real name is verrrrrry long.@0003
But they say it's a sound humans
can't hear.@0003
Fa's the only part that you can.@0003
@000CI see.@0003
@0009But maybe you could hear it, Elphin!@0003
You make so many pretty sounds,
maybe you could hear Fa's real name!@0003
@000CShall we try some time?@0003
@0009Yeah!@0003
[0347]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@012B@0009Elphin?@0003
@000CYes, what is it, Fa?@0003
@0009Fa always wanted
to ask you something.@0003
@000CWhat is it?
I hope I can give you an answer.@0003
@0009@0017Ummmm...
@0017Are you a girl or a boy?@0003
@000C...Which do you think?@0003
@0009Fa thought you were a girl
at first cause you're so pretty@0003
and you smell real nice!@0003
But then Roy said the other day
that you were a man...@0003
So that makes you a boy?@0003
@000CYes, I am a boy.
...Were you disappointed?@0003
@0009Nope!
...Sooo, you're a boy...@0003
Heehee...@0003
@000C@0017Hm?
What's the matter?@0003
@0009@0017Hey, Fa's gonna get as pretty
as you when she grows up.@0003
So wait till then, kay?
Promise!@0003@0011
@000CFa! Wait!@0003@0006
@0017...I seriously doubt that I will still
be alive by the time she grows up...@0003
@0017Well, I suppose I should let it go for now.@0003
[0348]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0105
@000C@0017Chief.@0003
@0009Shin...@0003
I'm sorry I put you through
such a difficult task.@0003
I must thank you for
finding my granddaughter.@0003
@000CIt was nothing, Chief.@0003
@0009It must not have been an easy journey.
Where did you go after you left us?@0003
@000CAfter we lost the battle,
I set out looking for Lady Sue.@0003
I traversed through Lycia and crossed
the ocean to the Western Isles.@0003
That is where I found her.
It was several months@0003
after you gave me the order.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
It has been a long time
since we lost that battle.@0003
@000CChief...@0003
@0009We lost many of our clansmen.
...Young ones, too.@0003
@000C@0017But you have survived, Chief.@0003
No matter how separated the clan is
you can bring us back together.@0003

[0349]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0105@000C@0017The nations in the west,
such as Lycia and Etruria,@0003
were very different from Sacae.@0003
There were soldiers clad in heavy armor
that would not allow arrows to pass.@0003
@0009So I would imagine.@0003
In the vast plains of Sacae,
horses are crucial.@0003
However, in more crowded areas,
key points are defended by soldiers@0003
such as the ones you speak of.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
@0009It is not surprising that our
tactics fail on foreign ground.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Betrayal and trickery are but
mere tactics to them.@0003
It is only us who think that
such methods are dirty.@0003
It is no surprise we lose.@0003
@000C...But...@0003
I cannot agree with such
...dirty fighting.@0003
@0009You must accept the fact that
people use it, though.@0003
We must be prepared for it when it
is used on us.@0003
[034A]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0105@0009@0017Shin.@0003
@000CYes?@0003
@0009Our Father the Sky has not only
brought us misfortune.@0003
Some good things happened
after we lost.@0003
Especially for you.@0003
@000CWhat do you mean?@0003
@0009The land isn't as it used to be.@0003
We of Sacae must think with broader
perspectives outside of the clans.@0003
@000CBut Chief...@0003
@0009You seem to have learned much
during your travels.@0003
I'm already too old to change my way
of thinking.@0003
But you are still young.@0003
It is your responsibility to lead
Sacae to a brighter future.@0003
This is an order from your Chief, Shin.@0003
It is up to you youths to decide Sacae's
fate.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
[034B]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0105@000C@0017Lady Sue, please step back.@0003
It's not wise to linger around the front.@0003
@0009Shin, this is a battlefield.
I have to go up front to fight.@0003
@000CI will do the fighting.@0003
You must think of your safety.@0003
@0009My archery skills have gotten much
better than before.@0003
I'm sure I can be of help to the army.@0003
@000CI have orders from the Silver Wolf
to keep you safe.@0003
I will not allow you to put yourself
in danger.@0003
@0009...Yes.
I will do as you say.@0003
@000CThank you.@0003
@0009You sound like Grandpa
when you argue with me.@0003
@000COf course.@0003
The Silver Wolf is whom I respect
the most.@0003
[034C]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0105@000C@0017Lady Sue, you're still staying up
front, aren't you?@0003
@0009I understand your concern, but I can't
be sitting around doing nothing, either.@0003
I can't stand simply watching the others
fight while I hide in safety.@0003
@000CI do understand how you feel.@0003
But Lady Sue, please don't
push yourself over the limit.@0003
You are the clan's last hope.@0003
@0009Then that is more the reason
I should go up front and fight.@0003
@000CThat depends on the place and time.@0003
Not everyone will follow somebody just
because he is fighting in the front lines.@0003
Lady Sue, we have a goal.@0003
We must gather our people and reconstruct
the Kutolah clan.@0003
Please do not forget that.@0003
@0009You, too.@0003
@000CHuh? Me?@0003
@0009I don't want you to push yourself
over the limit to protect me, either.@0003
I am not the only one working to
reconstruct the clan.@0003
@000CYes, you're right.
I shall remember that, my lady.@0003
@0009Thank you.
Do you promise not to stress yourself?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
[034D]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0105@0009@0017Shin, are you all right?@0003
@000CWhat is the matter, Lady Sue?
You don't look well...@0003
@0009I heard you were ambushed...@0003
@000CI'm not hurt, my Lady.@0003
@0009...Shin, I want you to retreat to the
back lines.@0003
I will take over for you.@0003
@000CWhat are you saying, Lady Sue?
It should be the other way around!@0003
@0009I've made up my mind.
You're going to step back.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
@0009Retreat to the back lines, Shin!
This is an order.@0003
@000CIs something wrong?
You're not acting like yourself.@0003
@0009...Everyone...
They were all killed by Bern...@0003
I couldn't even track down the traitor
in our ranks, and...they were all killed,@0003
right in front of my eyes...@0003
I was helpless, Shin.@0003
I don't want that feeling again.
I don't want to lose you!@0003
@000CLady Sue...@0003
@0009You must not die before I do.
Understood?@0003
@000CI was ordered to protect you, Lady Sue.
There is no way I would leave you and die.@0003
@0009Do you promise?@0003
@000CI shall swear to our Father the Sky
and our Mother the Earth.@0003
[034E]
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@0113@000C@0017Oh...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016You're...
Shin, right?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016You joined this army, too?
What a coincidence.@0003
@0009Yeah...
It is.@0003
@000C......
Um...oh.@0003
Did you find the woman you
were looking for?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I-I'm sorry...
Maybe I shouldn't have asked...@0003
@0009No...@0003
That's not it.
I was able to meet her.@0003
@000COh, you did?
That's nice to hear.@0003
@0009Yeah...
It is.@0003
[034F]
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@0113@000CShin!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0017@0016Is something wrong?@0003
@0009...I hadn't asked you yet.
Which clan are you from?@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009Are you from the Bulgar clan?@0003
Or are you part of the Djute
clan that betrayed us?@0003
@000C...I don't know.@0003
@0009......@0003
Was that...
a joke?@0003
@000CN-No, it wasn't.@0003
I lived with my parents so I don't
really know much about the clans...@0003
@0009...I see.@0003
@000CUm, you're from the Kutolah clan, right?
You said so before.@0003
@0009That's right.@0003
Our chief is the Silver Wolf,
the strongest warrior in Sacae.@0003
No one can match his mastery of
the sword and bow.@0003
@000C@0017You admire him greatly.@0003
@0009@0017...Can you tell?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I can tell by your eyes.
You're usually foreboding...@0003
I, I mean quiet...@0003
But you had a proud look on your
face just now.@0003
[0350]
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@0113@0009@0017You're...strange.@0003
@000CI...I am?@0003
@0009Sacaean women rarely pick up weapons.
Even if they do, they would choose a bow.@0003
You would rarely see a girl pick up a sword.@0003
@000COh...@0003
@0009And...@0003
Sacaean people worship the
Sky and Earth.@0003
You don't pray, and you don't
even belong to a clan...@0003
I have never seen a Sacaean like
you before.@0003
@000CI-I'm sorry...@0003
@0009No, I'm not accusing you.
I actually respect it.@0003
People can also live freely like you...
You've taught me a lesson.@0003
@000CI think you're exaggerating...@0003
But it feels nice to hear you
say that.@0003
@0009@0017You have beautiful eyes.@0003
@000CWh-What?@0003
@0009That must be because you're looking
straight ahead at your dream of@0003
mastering the sword.@0003
I will pray that your dream will
come true one day.@0003
@000C@0017Yes!
Thank you!@0003
[0351]
@0009@0010@0105@0017@0016......@0003@0002
......@0003@0002
......@0003@0011@0006
@000C@0010@010C@0016...Sigh...@0003
Why am I hiding here?
I want to talk to him, but...@0003
He's a little...forbidding.@0003
I'd like him to teach me how
to improve my bow skills.@0003
But how can I talk to him?
Well... maybe some other time...@0003
[0352]
@000C@0010@010CHello, Shin!
My name is Dorothy.@0003
@0017...A little too intrusive?@0003
Would you like to have an archery
duel?@0003
@0017...But I don't want to compete
with him.@0003
@0017What a nice bow!
Where did you buy it?@0003
@0017...No, that doesn't sound right
at all.@0003
Hmm... this is tough.@0003
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0016......@0003
@000C@0016@0017Oh, I know!@0003
I can bring him some food that he
likes...@0003
Wait, I don't know what kind of
food he likes...@0003
@0017I like fruit, but what about him?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0011
@000C@0016Hmm...well...
What can I do? ...@0003
[0353]
@000C@0010@010C@0017Hmm...@0003
...But why am I worrying so much
over him?@0003
...I can't figure that out, either.@0003
@0016Anyway.@0003
@0016I have to figure out a way to talk
to him.@0003
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0016...@0003
@000C@0016Oh...@0003@0002
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CUm, um...er...
@0017H-Hello!@0003
@0009@0017Yeah, hello...@0003
@000CUm, wh...what...@0003
@0009?@0003
@000CW-What...what...kind...@0003
@0009What kind...?@0003
@000CWhat food of kind you do like?
...... ...Shoot...@0003
@0009Fruit.@0003
@000CHuh?@0003
@0009What kind of food do I like, right?
I like fruit.@0003
@000CUm...
...Did you hear me talking to myself?@0003
@0009It was difficult not to listen with
such a loud voice.@0003
@000CUm...er...@0003
@0009If you want to talk to me,
then don't hesitate.@0003
@000C@0017It's all right!?@0003
@0009Of course...
We're in the same army.@0003
@000CYes!@0003
[0354]
@000C@0010@012A@0017Whoa!@0003@0011@0010@012A
@0009@0010@0105@0016......@0016@0003
@000CWhat are you doing, shooting at me!
I'm on your side!@0003
@0009...Oh, right.
You were.@0003
@000COh, right!?@0003
It's fatal for a Dragon Knight to get
shot with an arrow.@0003
Watch it, all right?@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009@0011@0006
@000C@0014So, he's looking at me like an enemy.@0003
Well, I suppose it can't be helped,
considering what Bern did to Sacae.@0003
But we can't be quarreling among allies...@0003
@0016Well...@0016
I guess I should do something about it.@0003
[0355]
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@012A@000CHey, Shin!
How are you doing?@0003
@0009@0017...Fine, as you can see.@0003
@000CYou're really great with your bow, huh?
You're hitting almost all of your targets.@0003
I'd like to as well, but I'm kinda...@0006
!!@0003
@0009Look out!@0080@000C!!@0003
@000C!@0003
@000A...Hm.
I missed his throat.@0080@000B@0003
@000CI thought I killed him...
Sorry...@0003
I made you clean up after
my mistake...@0003
@0009It was an automatic reaction.@0003
@000C@0017That doesn't matter.
You still saved my life.@0003
Hey, why don't you teach me some
tips on how to make my attacks@0003
more accurate?@0003
@0009@0017No.@0003@0011
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0017...Oh, well,
at least he helped me out...@0003
[0356]
@0009@0010@0105@0005@000C@0010@012A@0017Shin!
Behind you!@0003
@0009!@0003
@000CAre you all right?@0003
I guess even you have some trouble
when you're surrounded.@0003
@0009You didn't have to do that.@0003
@000CWell, I saw it.
It was an automatic reaction.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CWell, I'll be going now.@0003
Make sure you don't start
shooting at me again!@0003
@0009I won't make that mistake.@0003
@000C@0017You sure did the other day!@0003
...Well, we're in heated action, so it
can't be helped if you occasionally@0003
make a mistake.@0003
@0009@0017I'm not stupid enough to point my
bow at an ally.@0003
...There's no way I would shoot you.@0003
@000C...Yeah, you're right!@0003
@0009I'll be right behind you.
Leave the enemies you missed to me.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I will!@0003
[0357]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0106@000C@0017Grandpa.@0003
@0009Sue?
What's wrong?@0003
@000CI must apologize.@0003
@0009Because you couldn't get all
of our clansmen to escape?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016There was a traitor among us.
It couldn't be helped.@0003
@000CYes, it could.
I am the granddaughter of the Silver Wolf.@0003
I had to be able to lead our clansmen to
safety, no matter what the situation.@0003
But, I...@0003
@0009I'm the one who gave you those orders.
It is my responsibility.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
@0009Did you abandon your fellow
clansmen and flee all on your own?@0003
@000CNever!@0003
When the enemy appeared, I rushed at them
to make time for our people to escape.@0003
But that was a decoy...@0003
The enemies main forces were stationed
right where everyone fled to...@0003
@0009Good.
You did your best.@0003
I'm sure you can't forget it so easily,
but you must at least get over it.@0003
@000CYes...I'll try.@0003
[0358]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0106@0009@0017Sue,
are you feeling better now?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I see you're still suffering over it.@0003
Well, I suppose you can't get over it
that easily...@0003
@000CI...
I just let our people...@0003
@0009...Sue, let's go out for a
long ride after this battle.@0003
@000CA long ride?
In a time like this?@0003
@0009Especially in a time like this.@0003
You could get yourself killed fighting
with other things occupying your mind.@0003
Do you understand?@0003
@000CYes.
But...@0003
@0009You must listen more carefully to the
voice of the Sky and Earth.@0003
We humans are but tiny creatures compared
to the size of the great Sky and Earth.@0003
Haven't I always been telling you this?@0003
@000CBut I am listening...!@0003
@0009No, you are only listening to your
own voice.@0003
We're leaving for a while after this
battle.@0003
Understood?@0003
@000C...I'll do as you say.@0003
@0009Good girl.@0003
[0359]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0106@0009You look a lot better now,
Sue.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
@0017I still can't forget that I couldn't rescue
our fellow clansmen, but I've decided not to@0003
dwell on the past.@0003
@0017I'll look forward towards the future.@0003
@0009Ah, it seems that you've learned
something from our ride the other day.@0003
@000CI was able to listen to a lot of
nature's voices for a change.@0003
@0009Good!@0003
@0017I couldn't stand seeing you look
so distressed.@0003
@000CI never had such a look on my face.@0003
@0009The others wouldn't know,
but I would.@0003
I'm your grandfather.
I've known you ever since you were born.@0003
@000COh...
Grandpa.@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000C@0017Thank you.@0003
@0009@0017I was only doing my duty...
as your grandpa.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I know.@0003
[035A]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@010B@000C@0017All right,
where's the next enemy?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016?
@0017Do you need something, Sue?@0003
@0009@0017You use a bow, too.@0003
@000CYeah, I do.@0003
@0009Why don't you ride
on a horse?@0003
@000CWhy?
Well...@0003
I've always fought like this,
on my feet.@0003
@0009Isn't it hard to fight on the ground?@0003
@000CNo, not really.@0003
I mean, I think it would be harder
trying to shoot from horseback.@0003
@0009I see...@0003@0011
@000CUh, Sue?
@0017...What was that all about?@0003
[035B]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@010B
@0009Wolt.@0003
@000C@0017Oh hi, Sue.@0003
@0009I still think it's better
on horseback.@0003
@000CWhat?
...Do you mean about fighting with a bow?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
With a horse, it's easier to approach
and step back from your target.@0003
@000CWell, I'm sure it's up each his own...@0003
Wait, did you actually get off your
horse and try shooting from the ground?@0003
@0009I wouldn't know unless I actually try.@0003
@000CBut that's dangerous!@0003
If you do something you're not used to
during battle, you'll get yourself killed!@0003
@0009No, not in battle.@0003
I was just shooting at some trees
during our break.@0003
@000COh...@0003
@0009@0017Thank you.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009Thank you for being concerned
about me.@0003
@000C@0017Well...@0003
@0017We're allies in the same army,
right?@0003
[035C]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@010B
@0009@0017Wolt?@0003
What's the matter?
You're out of breath.@0003
@000C...Geez, it sure is tough trying to keep
up with a horse...@0003
I mean, remember how you said it was easier
to keep up with your target on horseback?@0003
So...@0003
@0009@0017You tried it?@0003
@000C@0017I wouldn't know unless I actually try.@0003
@0009@0017How did you do?@0003
@000C@0017Well, you can't beat a horse's speed.@0003
Still, I think it's more stable on foot, so...@0003
@0009@0017I thought it was dangerous to try something
you're not used to in battle?@0003
@000C...Oh.@0003
Well, I only tried it for a little bit.
So it's okay.@0003
@0009If you want to take advantage of a horse's
speed, you can ride behind me.@0003
@000C@0017That's all right with you?@0003
@0009@0017Although, I don't think you'll be able
to shoot very well...@0003
@000C@0017Shoot very well?@0003
I probably wouldn't even be able to stay on!
Yeah...@0003
I think I should stay on the ground.
It seems to be more fit for me.@0003
@0009@0017Hehehe.
Perhaps you're right.@0003
[035D]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0110
@000CAre you Dayan,
the Silver Wolf?@0003
@0009@0017You are not a Sacaean,
yet you know my name...@0003
Where did you hear about me?@0003
@000C@0017Once in the past,
I treated a wounded Sacaean.@0003
That is when I heard about the
unmatched warrior of Sacae.@0003
I was expecting someone with
white hair like mine.@0003
@0009@0017The name 'Silver Wolf'
comes from our ancestors.@0003
Our legends say that our
ancestors were wolves.@0003
@000CAh, I see.@0003
@0009Do you need something from me?@0003
If you wish to preach, I already
have a deity to worship.@0003
@000C@0017No,
I did not come to preach.@0003
@0009@0017...Are you sure?
Do you not have to serve your god?@0003
@000C@0017Of course, my mission is to guide
those in need of direction.@0003
But you Sacaeans already have the
sky and earth to worship.@0003
God would not approve of me
pushing my beliefs on you.@0003
@0009@0017...I see.@0003
[035E]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0110
@0009@0017We Sacaeans pray to the sky and the earth.@0003
The light of day and the darkness of night
that engulfs this land...@0003
They produce wind, lightning, fire, ice,
and many other affinities...@0003
Every person on this planet is protected
by one of the elements.@0003
According to my clan's beliefs, I am
protected by the Anima affinity.@0003
@000C@0017I see.
Interesting.@0003
@0009@0017What do you mean?@0003
@000C@0017The Elimine Church has similar beliefs.@0003
When the creator made man, he blessed
them all with one of the seven affinities@0003
However...those elements...@0003
@0009@0017...Those elements hold no power
on their own.@0003
@000C@0017Exactly.@0003
@0009Hm.
...Interesting, indeed.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
Perhaps...@0003
This is one of the truths of
the creation of our world.@0003
[035F]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0110@0009@0017The seven affinities...@0003
Their effects will only appear
through bonds with other people.@0003
When your heart is linked with
someone else's...@0003
That is when the elements reveal
their true power.@0003
@000C@0017Yes.@0003
Saint Elimine also said to cherish
your relationships.@0003
@0009@0017Hmm...@0003
I wonder if we have been able to
link our hearts with each other.@0003
@000C@0017I am sure we have.@0003
We have yet to find out
what effects it has...@0003
[0360]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@012F@000C@0017Hey...@0003
What's that?@0003
@0009Hm?@0003
Have you not seen eastern bows before?
This is a bow we use for training.@0003
@000CC-Can I see?@0003
@0009All right, here.
Try pulling the string.@0003
@000CLike this?@0003
@0009Hm, you're incredibly strong.@0003
A normal man wouldn't be able
to pull it at all.@0003
@000CI-I so strong.@0003
@0009Now,
try shooting the arrow here...@0003
@000CH-Huh?@0003
@0009First, you put an arrow here...@0003
@000CPut arrow here...@0003
@0009Now let go.@0003
@000CLet go...@0003@0002
@000CArgh.@0003@0011
@0009Gonzales!@0003
Are you all right?@0003
@000CArrow hit me...@0003
[0361]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@012F@0009@0017Let me see your head.@0003
Yes...
It looks fine now.@0003
@000CUh...@0003
No more bow for me.@0003
What's that horse?
Strange hair color.@0003
@0009Ah, it looks different from the horses
where you come from, doesn't it?@0003
We can survive in Sacae thanks to
these horses.@0003
We have no trouble keeping up with the
mounts that knights ride, either.@0003
@000CI-I want to ride...@0003
@0002Gah.@0080@0011@0003
@0009Gonzales!@0003
Are you all right?@0003
Horses are very sensitive to people
standing behind them.@0003
You have to be careful.@0003
@000C...Ow...@0003
[0362]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@012F@0009@0017I'm sorry, Gonzales.@0003
It seems that whenever you are with
me, you get injured.@0003
@000CIt's okay.@0003
@0009Here,
I'll give you this as an apology.@0003
@000CWhat's this?@0003
@0009That's a headdress that we of the
Kutolah clan wear.@0003
It would suit a fine warrior like
you nicely.@0003
@000C...Thank you.@0003
@0009Take this as well.@0003
It's a wine made from horse milk.
We drink it at festivities.@0003
@000CI happy.@0003
I drink.@0003
@0009Wait,
don't...drink so much...@0003
@000CUh?@0003
Uhhhhhhhh?@0003@0011
@0009Gonzales!
Can you get up?@0003
This wine is very strong.@0003
You shouldn't drink so much of
it at once.@0003
@000CUhhhhh...@0003
[0363]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0114@000C@0017You...@0003
You're the Silver Wolf...@0003
@0009So you are a warrior of Sacae, too.
What is your name?@0003@0002
@000CRutger.@0003
..I was at Bulgar.@0003@0002
@0009Bulgar...@0003
So you survived.@0003
I heard that most of the clans
there were decimated...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016That time...@0003
I learned that it is the law of
nature that the weak die out.@0003
That is the same anywhere,
whether it be Sacae, or Bern!@0003
@0009Then...
Is that the reason why you are here?@0003
To become strong and have your
you revenge on Bern...?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
[0364]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0114@0009@0017Rutger.@0003
You said that you fight
for revenge.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016What will you do after
you have your revenge?@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009I am asking you...@0003
After you avenge your clan,
what will you do?@0003
@000C...You have no right to know.@0003
@0009Will you dedicate your life...
to revenge?@0003
Is that all right with you?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016You want me to just keep quiet, even
after seeing my entire clan killed?@0003
...But you have suffered the same.@0003
@0009That is not what I am saying.@0003
We are men of Sacae.@0003
We must make those who desecrate
our land pay.@0003
However...even if we do win this
war and destroy Bern, those that@0003
we lost will still not return.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016You cannot regain what you have
lost through revenge.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016I know no other way to live.@0003
[0365]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0114@0009@0017Rutger.@0003
What will you do after this war is over?
Do you have a place to go?@0003
@000C...No.@0003
@0009So I thought.@0003
Then would you join the
Kutolah clan?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Our clan has lost,
but we haven't been destroyed.@0003
Once the war ends, we will gather
in the plains once again.@0003
It would be helpful if you were
there with us.@0003
@000C...I don't take offers.@0003
@0009It is not an offer.@0003
I am asking you because I have
faith in your strength as a warrior.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Hm...
Difficult person, I see.@0003
@0009Then I shall say no more.@0003
But always remember that if you
ever change your mind, we will@0003
welcome you with open arms.@0003
Keep that in mind...
wherever you go.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0002
@000C@0016...Yeah.@0003
[0366]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0122@000CBarth.
I haven't thanked you yet, have I?@0003
@0009@0017Thanked me?@0003
@000C@0017You came to rescue me,
remember?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, that.@0003
I was just fulfilling my duty
as a knight, my lady.@0003
In fact, I must apologize that we
couldn't get to you earlier.@0003
@000CBarth...
I'm sorry.@0003
I can never give you anything
in return...@0003
@0017Oh, I know.
Here, take this necklace.@0003
@0009@0017Lady Lilina, please.@0003
We do not fight for reward.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
@0009@0017You were safe.@0003
That in itself is reward enough,
my lady.@0003
@000CThank you, Barth...@0003
[0367]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0122@000CBarth.@0003
Do you remember Devias and
Leygance?@0003
@0009@0017All I know is that they were making
contact with Bern to start a rebellion.@0003
However, the rumors that I have heard
about them are all bad.@0003
I understand that they were using their
position as generals to illegally collect@0003
money.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
@0009The rebellion was being planned
even before Bern invaded.@0003
Ashtor has found proof of that.@0003
@000CYes...
I was foolish.@0003
They were both my fathers' knights, so...
I didn't want to suspect them.@0003
I wanted to trust them.@0003
@0009But the trust is what
put you in danger...@0003
@000CI know...
I'm truly sorry, Barth...@0003
@0009Lady Lilina,
please value your safety above all.@0003
You are our master, and we knights
depend on you to pledge our loyalty.@0003
[0368]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0122
@000C@0017Barth...@0003
What do you think will happen
to Ostia now, without my father?@0003
@0009Unless someone rebuilds Ostia after this
war is done, it will fall further and@0003
further into chaos.@0003
That someone is you, Lady Lilina.@0003
@000CBut...
I don't think I'm qualified.@0003
I'm just going to be a
nuisance to you all...@0003
You...think so too,
right?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016I know not how a person in power
should be, but...@0003@0002
When you said that you wanted to trust
your servants, I certainly did not@0003
feel that you were mistaken in
thinking so.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I have one thing to say to you,
my lady.@0003
No matter what kind of path that
you would follow from now on,@0003
we knights will swear our
loyalty to always support you.@0003
[0369]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0116
@0009Oujay.@0003
@000CSir Barth.@0003
@0009@0017Have you been keeping
up with your training?@0003
@000COf course.@0003
@0009...I've been wanting to asking you,
but why did you not try to become@0003
an Armor Knight?@0003
Why did you become a Mercenary?@0003
@000CI figured heavy armor wouldn't
suit me very well.@0003
@0009That is because you are not
training yourself hard enough.@0003
@000CWell, but I wasn't born with...@0003
@0009This is the perfect opportunity.
I shall train you every day from now on.@0003
Then you may be able to become an
Armor Knight.@0003
@000CAre you sure...?@0003
[036A]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0116
@000C@0017Sir Barth...
This training is just...crazy.@0003
@0009You'll get used to it soon enough.@0003
I do this everyday.@0003
@000CYes, but I don't have the
build that you do...@0003
@0009Did you say something?@0003
@000CNo...@0003
@0009Just keep quiet and
train yourself.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
[036B]
@0009@0010@0108@0009@0017?@0003
Is someone doing practice swings...?@0003
@0011@0006@000C@0010@0116
@000CPhew...@0003
I wonder if I've gotten any closer
to Sir Barth now.@0003
@0009@0010@0108Oujay.@0003
@000CWoah!?@0003
Oh, Sir Barth!
You scared me.@0003
@0009@0017Good,
very good.@0003
You see, your body has
gotten used to training itself.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I feel like I just have to keep
moving my body.@0003
And besides, I would hate to lose someone
because I wasn't strong enough.@0003
@0009@0017I see you have learned your lesson.@0003
If you keep a habit of training yourself,
you will never get tired in battle.@0003
It doesn't matter whether you are an
Armor Knight or Mercenary.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
But I thought you wanted to
make me an Armor Knight.@0003
@0009I just said that to make you train
as a habit.@0003
I know your build wouldn't be able
to handle heavy armor.@0003
@000CReally?@0003
@0009It encouraged you more,
didn't it?@0003
@000CIt did?
I wonder...@0003
@0009What did you say?@0003
@000CNo, nothing...@0003
[036C]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0109@000CAh, Barth.
It's been a long time.@0003
@0009Yes, it has.@0003
@0017It seems that you have become
stronger since you left.@0003
@000CThey were tough battles indeed.@0003
@0009Well, I wasn't just sitting around
in Ostia, either.@0003
I was training myself at the arena,
preparing myself for when a battle@0003
breaks out.@0003
@000C...That arena.@0003
Sorry for saying this, but...
I really don't approve of it.@0003
A knight, fighting to make money?
That's...@0003
@0009No one has a need for
a weak Armor Knight.@0003
I will keep training myself
to prevail in battle.@0003
@000C@0017Well...
You haven't changed at all, I see.@0003
@0009Neither have you.@0003
[036D]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0109@000C@0017Barth...
Was it all right with you?@0003
@0009About what?@0003
@000CDid you not want to go into battle
alongside Lord Hector?@0003
After all, you were always saying that
a knight's true purpose is to go out@0003
and fight.@0003
@0009...It would be a lie to say I didn't
feel that way.@0003
But I figured staying here and protecting
protecting this land and Lady Lilina@0003
would be a form of battle.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
@0009But I allowed Lady Lilina into the
hands of the enemy.@0003
I was naive...@0003
Somewhere at the bottom of my
heart, I believed Ostia was at peace.@0003
@000CDon't blame yourself...
You need to fix that part of you.@0003
@0009Yes, I do...@0003
@0017Well, whenever I talk to you, it seems
that I reveal my inner feelings.@0003
@000CWe've been friends ever since we
we were knighted.@0003
Even if we try to hide something,
we could easily see through it.@0003
@0009Haha...
Exactly.@0003
[036E]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0109@0009@0017Bors,
I always wanted to ask you...@0003
@000CAsk me what?@0003
@0009Why did you want to become an
Armor Knight?@0003
@000CBecause I wanted to protect those
I love with this armor.@0003
@0009I see.@0003
@000CWhat about you?@0003
@0009I became an Armor Knight because
they are strongest fighters.@0003
I believe that in a 1 on 1 battle, no
other unit can match the Armor Knight.@0003
...Which is probably why I couldn't protect
Lady Lilina against a large horde...@0003
@000CThat again?@0003
@0009That happened because I wasn't
strong enough.@0003
If I had enough power to stop the
rebellion all on my own,@0003
I would not have allowed the situation
to get out of hand.@0003
I must become stronger still.@0003
@000C...I see.@0003
@0017...Then you are to become a spear
stronger than any other.@0003
And I shall become a shield tougher
than any other.@0003
@0009@0017A spear and a shield...@0003
@000C@0017Let us together make the way for the
lives that we shall lead in the future.@0003
@0009Sounds good, friend!@0003
[036F]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@01BD@000CSir Barth!
Are you all right?@0003
@0009@0017Of course.@0003
I would never lose to such puny
enemies like these.@0003
@000CYes,
of course.@0003
@0009@0017I won't ask you if you're safe,
either.@0003
We Ostian knights will never lose.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
@0009I'm glad that you're looking out for me,
but you should be concerned about yourself@0003
before worrying about others.@0003
@000C@0017Yes.@0003
[0370]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@01BD@0009@0017What's the matter, Wendy?
You're panting.@0003
An Ostian knight wouldn't be heaving
after a light battle like that.@0003
@000CYes, I'm sorry.@0003
@0009Remember our training, Wendy!@0003
Don't you remember how we marched
full-speed over the that mountain?@0003
This nothing compared to that!@0003
@000CYes!@0003
@0009Show the enemy...
the wrath of the Ostian knights!@0003
@000C@0017Yes!
I will!@0003
[0371]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@01BD@000C@0017Sir Barth,
how can I improve my skills further?@0003
@0009@0017You're already a full-fledged
Ostian knight, Wendy.@0003
I don't have anything to
criticize you for.@0003
@000C@0017Thank you!@0003
But...
Sir Barth...@0003
Can you...
say something?@0003
@0009@0017Something?
What?@0003
@000CUm...@0003
I'm sure there is something
I need to work on, so...@0003
@0009No.@0003
From now on,
you must judge your own self.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
@0009What's the matter?
Why do you look so discouraged?@0003
@000CI...
I want you to teach me more...@0003
@0009?@0003
@000CDon't...
Don't leave me, Sir Barth...@0003
@0009Huh?
What are you talking about?@0003
We are now comrades
fighting together.@0003
I wouldn't just leave you.@0003
@000C@0017Really?@0003
@0009@0017Of course.@0003
...We have wasted enough time
talking like this.@0003
Let's get moving, Wendy!@0003
@000C@0017Yes!@0003
[0372]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@011D@0009@0017This is no surprise, but Bern
seems to have been doing something@0003
behind the scenes even before the
war started.@0003
@000CYeah.@0003
The traitors in the Alliance, the
rebellion at Ostia...@0003
It all happened according to their plans.
Well of course, I can't say much because@0003
I didn't realize when it mattered the
most...@0003
@0009The betrayals in the Alliance,
and Lord Hector's death...@0003
We are all to blame for that.@0003
@000CNah, it's my fault.@0003
The mistake I made, it was just...
It was just way too big.@0003
@0009...We must keep our eyes sharp so that such
a tragedy does not happen in the future.@0003
@000CYeah, I know.
Traitors and spies could be anywhere.@0003
Like in this army, for example.@0003
@0009What...!@0003
There is a traitor in our ranks!?@0003
@000CNo...
Not that I know of.@0003
But you can never be too careful.@0003
I carved that concept into my
heart when Lord Hector was killed.@0003
[0373]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@011D@0009@0017Asthor, about the other day...
About the traitor.@0003
@000CYeah?@0003
@0009Do you have any suspects?@0003
@000CNo, not yet.@0003
But I need all the information I can
get, so I'm doing some research in@0003
the shadows.@0003
@0009Traitors...
If you think of the possibilities...@0003
The list keeps getting longer.@0003
@000CYeah, we've got people
from just about everywhere.@0003
I'll have to go through them
individually one by one...@0003
This'll be a tough job.@0003
@0009The most obvious suspect
would be her...@0003
@000CRight.
Guinevere, Princess of Bern.@0003
You can't help but suspect her.@0003
@0009Master Roy trusts her.
I really don't to think that she...@0003
@000CYeah, I know...@0003
@0009We would lose any trust our comrades
had for us when they find out we are@0003
suspecting them..@0003
@000C......
It's tough, ain't it?@0003
But someone's got to do it.@0003
[0374]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@011D@0009@0017Ashtor.@0003
...How did it go?@0003
@000CYeah.@0003
It took some time, but
I'm much more confident.@0003
The princess is innocent.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
@000CPrincess Guinevere really
trusts General Roy.@0003
So does everyone else here.
Well, what do you know...@0003
This ragtag group's bond is
pretty strong.@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
I'm relieved.@0003
@000CUh-huh.
So that's taken care of.@0003
When we get someone new, I'll
be sure to keep an eye on him.@0003
@0009I'm sorry to have to give all
this dirty work to you...@0003
@000C@0017Hey, don't let it bother you.
It's what I do.@0003
[0375]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0109@000C@0017Lady Lilina...@0003
Has something been bothering you
lately?@0003
@0009Eh...
No, everything's fine.@0003
@000CAre you sure...?@0003
I have been given special orders by
Lord Hector to protect you at all costs.@0003
@0009And?@0003
@000CSo if something has happened, I should
know about it so I can protect you well..@0003
@0009@0017I said, nothing's wrong!@0003
@000CB-But you wouldn't be so...
touchy in your normal state...@0003
@0009Touchy!?
I'm not being touchy!@0003
@000CYes, but...@0003
@0009Just be quiet, Bors!
You're annoying me.@0003
@000CW-Where are you going, my lady?@0003
@0009Someplace where I won't
have to listen to you.@0003
@000CLady Lilina!@0003
[0376]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0109@0009@0017Bors, uh...
About the other day...@0003
@000CThe other day?@0003
@0009I wanted to apologize.@0003
@000C@0017To me?@0003
@0009@0017You were just being concerned for me,
and I just blew up at you like that...@0003
I'm sorry.@0003
@000CPlease...don't be.@0003
@0009...Will you hear why I'm so irritated?
I think I need someone to talk to...@0003
@000CIf I would suffice.@0003
@0009It's about Roy...
What do you think about him?@0003
@000CWell...@0003
I think he has grown splendidly well to
to be a wise and caring leader to us all.@0003
@0009But the Roy I know would have
mismatched buttons on his suit,@0003
and he wouldn't be able to do
one dance step properly...@0003
So I always thought I had to
take care of him.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016But Roy's suddenly changing.
He's gotten so...grown up, you know?@0003
He seems like such a faraway person
now...@0003
@000C...My lady, Master Roy has not changed
as much as you think.@0003
@0009Do you think so?@0003
@000CIt is true that he has grown and matured,
but that does not change the nature of@0003
the person.@0003
Master Roy's nature is still the same
as you know it to be, my lady.@0003
@0009Yeah, that's right...
Thank you for listening to me, Bors.@0003
@000COf course, my lady.@0003
[0377]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0109@000CYou look much better today,
my lady.@0003
@0009Yes, I feel much better now.@0003
@000CThat is good to hear.@0003
@0009@0017It's not like Roy was avoiding me or
anything...@0003
It's just that he seemed to be changing,
and I was getting left behind.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I was just jumping to conclusions
and fretting over nothing...@0003
Once I realized that, it suddenly
seemed so silly.@0003
@0017I'm still a kid, aren't I?@0003
@000C@0017Lady Lilina...@0003
@0009@0017Bors, will you always stay
by my side from now on?@0003
@000C...I am a knight,
and my loyalty is with you.@0003
I shall always be there for you.@0003
@0009Thank you, Bors...@0003
[0378]
@0009@0010@01BD@000C@0010@0109
@0009@0017Bors?@0003
@000C@0017O-Oh!
Hello, Wendy.@0003
What a, uh, coincidence!@0003
@0009@0017It is good to see that you are well.
Did you need something, brother?@0003
@000C@0017No...
I didn't.@0003
I was just walking around, and
I ran into you, yes.@0003
@0009@0017I see...@0003
@000C@0017Are you hurt?
Is your armor too heavy?@0003
@0009@0017No, I am fine, brother.
Well, I must be off...@0003
@000C@0017You're going already?
You could rest awhile longer...@0003
@0009@0017Thank you for your consideration,
but I really must be off.@0003
The battle is starting.@0003
@000CY-Yes, of course...
Of course you should.@0003
[0379]
@0009@0010@01BD@000C@0010@0109
@0009@0017...Bors?@0003
@000C@0017Oh, Wendy...
Just running in to you like this...@0003
Pure coincidence, yes...@0003
@0009@0017Is something...
wrong?@0003
@000C@0017Ah, no no, nothing.@0003
Well, since we've met again like this,
why don't we stop and talk a little?@0003
Well, are you hurt?@0003
Is your armor not too heavy?@0003
@0009@0017No, I'm fine.
Thanks for your consideration.@0003
@000C@0017Are you taking care of your
spear and your helmet well?@0003
@0009@0017Yes.@0003
@000C@0017Are you eating properly?@0003
Do you have any worries that you
want to talk about?@0003
@0009@0017I'm fine.@0003
@000CHave you made a lot of friends?
Any boyfriends...@0003
[037A]
@0009@0010@01BD@000C@0010@0109
@0009@0017Bors...@0003
@000C@0017Whoa, W-Wendy!
We certainly meet a lot...@0003
@0009@0017Yes, brother.
Did you need something?@0003
@000C@0017No, nothing.
Just...@0003
@0009@0017Bors...@0003
@000C@0017Hm?@0003
@0009@0017I am really grateful for your
consideration all the time.@0003
But I am a knight of Ostia.@0003
I'm training myself so I can
become like you.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009If I want to become strong, I can't
be depending on you all the time.@0003
I'm going to be fine, really, so
please don't worry...@0003
I must be off.@0003
...I'm really grateful for you,
brother.@0003@0011@0007
@000C@0017@0016......@0016@0003
...I see...@0003
She's grown so much.@0003
I suppose I was the one...
being childish...@0003@0002
Wendy, I wish you luck.@0003
[037B]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@0109@0009Yo, Bors.@0003
@000C@0017Ashtor...
What is the matter?@0003
@0009@0017Nah, nothing's the matter.
I just wanted to say hi.@0003
Hahaha...@0003
@000C@0017@0016.....@0016
This smell...@0003
Are you drinking?@0003
@0009@0017Ah, yeah. I was bored so I
decided to have a little one...@0003
@000C@0017Bored?
We are in the middle of a battle...@0003
@0009@0017Hey, all I can do is open chests and
doors...@0003
I can't fight at all.@0003
Well, I'll leave the fighting to you
and be on my way...@0003
Sorry to bother you.@0003
@0011@000C@0016.....@0003
[037C]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@0109@0009Oh, Bors.
Long time no see.@0003
@000C@0017Ashtor...@0003
I think you should...refrain
a little from your drinking.@0003
There are others watching, and
you are setting a bad example.@0003
@0009Hey, Bors...@0003
@000C...Yes?@0003
@0009I'm sorry...
about Lord Hector...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I heard there was a traitor in
the Lycia Alliance...@0003
If I'd gotten off my lazy ass and
had been doing my job properly,@0003
that wouldn't have happened...
Lord Hector would never have lost...@0003
As...long as he had the right
information...@0003
@000C@0016.....@0003
@0016It is not your
fault.@0003
@0009And, you know...
The rebellion.@0003
It was obvious that it was going
to break out...@0003
And still, I couldn't do anything...@0003
Heh, talk about being totally
worthless...@0003
You all must feel sorry for
Lord Hector...@0003
Having such a useless spy like me...@0003
Haha... ha...
@0003
@000C@0016.....@0003
@0009@0016Damn...
I'm out of booze...@0003
[037D]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@0109@000C@0017Ashtor.@0003
@0009@0017Eh...?
Oh, Bors.@0003
Come on,
have a drink with me...@0003
@000C@0017Stop blaming yourself.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016We lost Lord Hector.
The responsibility lies in all of us.@0003
But... Still...
We must not look back to the past.@0003
We must move forward.@0003
We have to make the dream that Lord
Hector couldn't fulfill come true.@0003
And we need you for that, Ashtor.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016You... why?@0003
@0009Why do you...defend a drunken,
useless wretch like me...?@0003
@000CThat is because you are
a knight of Ostia.@0003
@0009...A knight?
Who...me?@0003
@000CAlthough you have not
been officially knighted...@0003
You fought with your life to
defend Lord Hector.@0003
That is more than enough
to make you a loyal knight.@0003
At least, I would think so.@0003
@0009@0016.....@0003
@0016...Bo..rs... I...@0003
@000C@0017Ashtor, let us walk the path...
@0014and fulfill the dream of our master.@0003
[037E]
@0009@0010@0109@000C@0010@0116@000CSir Bors?
You are Sir Bors, right?@0003
@0009@0017Oh...
Who are you?@0003
@000C@0017I'm Oujay of Ostia's Armor Knights.
I have heard of you from Wendy.@0003
@0009@0017Ah, from her...
So you are our newest member?@0003
@000C@0017Yes.
I'm pleased to meet you.@0003
@0009But... you don't seem fit to be
an Armor Knight.@0003
@000CYes, I figured that would fill in the
parts that our squad is lacking in.@0003
@0009Ah, I see.
That's very noble of you.@0003
Not many can do the same.@0003
@000CThank you.@0003
[037F]
@0009@0010@0109@000C@0010@0116@000C@0017I heard from Sir Barth, that you
have even beaten him once, right?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
Just once, in a martial arts
tournament held in Ostia.@0003
@000CWhat was the battle like?@0003
@0009Well...@0003
To tell the truth, I actually don't
remember very well.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
Was the battle with Sir Barth so
boring that you don't even remember?@0003
@0009That's not it.@0003
It was because I don't fight for the
sake of fighting.@0003
That time I was forced to participate, and I
wasn't interested in the tournament itself.@0003
So I've already forgotten most of what
happened in it.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Oujay, there must always be
a cause in battle.@0003
You must never fight for the
sake of fighting.@0003
[0380]
@0009@0010@0109@000C@0010@0116@000CSir Bors, you said the other day that
there must always be a cause in battle.@0003
@0009@0017Yes.@0003
And for that cause, you must be willing
to go through any and all hardships.@0003
Do you have such a cause?@0003
@000CWell...
Unfortunately, I don't.@0003
I became a mercenary to feed
my family.@0003
So I don't really have a cause...@0003
@0009You've got one right there.@0003
@000CHuh?@0003
@0009Feeding your family is a great cause.@0003
And for that cause, you train yourself
and become stronger, stronger than@0003
anyone else.@0003
@000CY-Yes!@0003
@0009A cause is not just limited to
large scale things like defending@0003
your country or saving the world.@0003
All right?@0003
[0381]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@01BD
@0009Hello, Wendy.@0003
@000C@0017Lady Lilina...
Please stay close to me.@0003
I shall protect you with my life.@0003
@0009@0017Th-Thank you...@0003
That armor...
It's quite an accomplishment.@0003
Isn't it heavy for a girl?@0003
@000C@0017No, my lady.@0003
The weight of a knight's armor
is the symbol of his loyalty.@0003
@0009All right...
But just don't strain yourself.@0003
@000CThank you very much,
my lady.@0003
@0009@0017Why did you become an Armor Knight?
Did you want to become like Bors?@0003
@000C@0017Yes...
My brother is the goal that I pursue.@0003
I wish to protect you like my
brother does, Lady Lilina.@0003
[0382]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@01BD@0009Wendy.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, Lady Lilina?@0003
@0009@0017Let's chat a little.
Tell me about yourself.@0003
@000C@0017Yes.@0003
I am an Armor Knight of Ostia.@0003
@0009@0017No, not things like that...@0003
For example, do you have a
man whom you fancy?@0003
@000C@0017A...man?@0003
@0009@0017Yes.@0003
@000C@0017I... don't really know.@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
@000C@0017I always just focused on becoming
strong like my brother, so...@0003
I never really thought about
things like that...@0003
@0009I see...@0003
@0017Let's talk about something else then.@0003
We're both girls in the same army that
grew up in the same place.@0003
I want to know about you.@0003
[0383]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@01BD@000C@0017Lady Lilina,
you are an odd individual.@0003
@0009@0017Odd?
Why?@0003
@000C@0017You are in a much higher position
than we are...@0003
But you still come right down to talk
to us with a smile on you face.@0003
It seems...odd.@0003
@0009@0017Do you think so?
I just want to be friends with you.@0003
@000C@0017F-Friends?@0003
I don't think that would be
possible, my lady..@0003
You are my master!@0003
@0009@0017That doesn't make a difference.@0003
You're the only girl around my age
that grew up in the same area.@0003
Let's not worry about who's the
master or the servant...@0003
@000C@0017Lady Lilina!@0003
You are carrying Ostia's future
on your shoulders.@0003
You are different from us.@0003
You do understand, do you not?@0003
@0009...So we can't be friends?@0003
@000CI'm sorry.@0003
But I am very grateful for
your consideration.@0003
Perhaps we cannot be friends,@0003
but would you allow me to go over
and chat with you once in awhile?@0003
@0009@0017Of course!@0003
...Thank you, Wendy.@0003
[0384]
@0009@0010@01BD@000C@0010@0116@000CWhat are you doing,
Wendy?@0003
@0009@0017I'm practicing my walking.@0003
@000CWalking?
Why?@0003
@0009For an Armor Knight, it's tough
to get back up if you fall to@0003
the ground.@0003
You have to build strong legs to
make sure that you will never fall.@0003
@000CI see.@0003
@0009The basics are everything, Oujay.@0003
[0385]
@000C@0010@0116@000C@0017Ha! Ha!@0003
@0009@0010@01BDOujay, are you doing practice
swings with your sword?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
I can't be losing to you, so I thought
I'd retrain myself the basics also.@0003
@0009I see.@0003
But,
I won't lose to you either.@0003
@000CI suppose we've got a
little competition going, then.@0003
[0386]
@0009@0010@01BD@000C@0010@0116@000CHow are you doing, Wendy?@0003
@0009@0017I'm doing well, of course.@0003
I can't be complaining if I want
to be a strong Armor Knight.@0003
@000CYes, me too.
If I want to be a powerful mercenary...@0003
@0009...Oujay, thank you.@0003
@000CWh-What?@0003
@0009I've been able to keep trying
because I'm competing with you.@0003
If I didn't have you with me, I
probably would have given up, sayingア@0003
'It wouldn't have been possible
for a girl anyway.'@0003
@000C...I feel the same way.@0003
I've been able to come this far
thanks to you.@0003
We're even.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
But I still won't allow myself
to lose to you.@0003
@000CI'll throw those words right
back at you, Wendy!@0003
[0387]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@01BD@000C@0017Sir Asthor.@0003
@0009@0017Hm?
Oh...@0003
You're Sir Bors' younger sister.@0003
@000C@0017What are you doing back here?@0003
With your light gear,
you should be far ahead of us.@0003
@0009@0017Uh...
Sorry.@0003
Your legs and back don't really
work the way you want them to@0003
when you're my age...@0003
@000C@0017...Sir Asthor,
just how old are you?@0003
@0009@0017Whoo, scary...@0003
You're even more serious than
your brother.@0003
And you're even built like him.@0003
What a shame for a girl of your
age to be so f-@0003
@000C@0017I'm not fat!
This is my armor!@0003
@0009@0017O-Okay, okay.
Just calm down...@0003
@000C@0017A-Anyway...@0003
Try to learn from
my brother a little more.@0003
[0388]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@01BD@000C@0017Sir Asthor!@0003
@0009@0017Hey, Wendy.
How are you doing?@0003
@000C@0017...Sir Asthor...@0003
What are you doing relaxing
here like this...@0003
This is a battlefield!@0003
Please be more serious!@0003
@0009@0017Well, there is no point in
getting too fired up for nothing.@0003
Come on, let's take it easy.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017You won't get away today.@0003
I'll drag you away if I
have to!@0003
@0009Woah...@0003
Hey,
wait a minute...@0003
@0080@000B
@000CS-Sir Asthor...@0003
That wound...@0003
@0009@0017Oh...
Don't worry about it.@0003
It's just an old scar.@0003
I can't do much with this
leg because of it.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017When...did you get that wound?@0003
@0009@0017Uh...
A long time ago.@0003
I kinda messed up when I snuck
into Bern's castle on a mission.@0003
I managed to get away, so I guess it's
a scar of honor, so to speak.@0003
@000C@0017I...@0003
I'm sorry!
I didn't know...@0003
@0009Yeah, so I told
you not to worry about it...@0003
[0389]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@01BD@000C@0017Sir Asthor!@0003
@0009@0017Ah, Wendy.
Beautiful as always.@0003
@000C@0017You can't flatter me like that.
I understand about your leg.@0003
But!
I still have a lot to tell you!@0003
First,
about your drinking habits...@0003
@0009...Oh damn...@0003
@000CNo, you're not getting away.@0003
You shall behave like a proper
Ostian knight from now on!@0003
@0009Uh-huh...@0003
[038A]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@010A@000C@0017Prince Mildain...!
What is wrong!?@0003
Your eyes...@0003
@0009That voice...
Is it Douglas?@0003
@000CCan you not see, your Highness?
I thought your eyes had recovered...@0003
@0009I still temporarily go
blind sometimes...@0003
I will be fine once I rest
for a while.@0003
@000C...I heard that the side effects
of the poison had blinded you for@0003
several months...@0003
Forgive me, my prince...@0003
If only I had been on my guard,
you would never have suffered this@0003
horrible fate...@0003
@0009...I wonder how...
my father is doing.@0003
Is he still in the same state?@0003
@000CI regret to say that he
is, Your Highness.@0003
He does not know of your
safety yet.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CBut I am sure the life will return to
him when you return to the palace in@0003
one piece, Prince Mildain.@0003
He will recover...
and so will our nation.@0003
[038B]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@010A@000C@0017My prince,@0003
the balance of power on this continent
has been changing drastically due@0003
to General Roy's tactics.@0003
@0009@0017Yes...so it seems.@0003
@000C@0017It will not be long before this
army conquers the entire continent.@0003
I believe that would be the perfect time to
announce your succession to the throne...@0003
@0009Douglas...
about that.@0003
@000CYes, Prince Mildain?@0003
@0009I have hesitations about
returning to Etruria...@0003
@000CWhat are you saying!?@0003
Our people are all anxious
about your safety...@0003
@0009Douglas.@0003
After I went to the Western Isles and
joined the rebels, I learned much.@0003
Too much, in fact.@0003
I witnessed innocent civilians being treated
like animals under corrupt Etrurian landlords.@0003
If I hadn't been caught up in the
assassination, I probably never would@0003
have known.@0003
@000CThen that is all the more reason to use
that experience to fix those problems...@0003
@0009I promise I will return to
the palace.@0003
But...@0003
Right now, I want to be with
the people and watch over them.@0003
[038C]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@010A
@000CPrince Mildain...@0003
@0009@0017Don't call me that...
I am but a simple bard here.@0003
I am not your prince,
and you are not my general.@0003
You don't mind that just for
now, do you?@0003
@000C...Yes.@0003
Then I shall pledge my loyalty to you as
another human being, not as a general.@0003
@0009...It is ever so
hard to bend your ways.@0003
@000CMy unbending will is my strength.@0003
@0009...This war will end soon.@0003
General Roy is still young,
but he understands the people.@0003
He will lead not only Etruria, but the
whole continent to a Gilded Age of peace.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
@0009I should do something as well,
don't you think?@0003
@000CI shall accompany you
wherever you go.@0003
[038D]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@010A@000C@0017Geese.@0003
@0009Hey...
Long time no see.@0003
@000CI want to thank you for
what you've done.@0003
I understand that you safely
escorted Pr-@0003
...I mean, Elphin to the
Western Isles.@0003
@0009Yeah,
I did what I could.@0003
That bard was an interesting guy.@0003
The girl he was with was seasick
the whole time, though.@0003
@000CI see...
Geese, I must apologize.@0003
I've misjudged you.@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000CSince the assassins were after Elphin,
I couldn't put him on a large scale ship.@0003
That would be the first place they would
look.@0003
So I had to ask you.@0003
But I can't say that I fully trusted you,
a pirate.@0003
However, you kept your word.@0003
@0009Hey...
No problem.@0003
@000CYou could have turned him over to the Coup
d'etat forces and gotten a hefty reward.@0003
Why did you choose to help him?@0003
It didn't make you any money.@0003
@0009@0017...Well, saving people makes
you feel good afterwards.@0003
Piracy sure as hell doesn't.@0003
[038E]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@010A@0009@0017Hey.@0003
@000CGeese,
I must give you some kind of reward.@0003
@0009Reward?@0003
@000CYou have been a great help
to our country.@0003
I can give you anything
you ask.@0003
@0009What're you talking about...
I already got my payment you promised me.@0003
@000CNo...
That is not a sufficient reward.@0003
You are a hero to the Etrurian people.@0003
@0009Hero?
That guy's just a bard, right?@0003
Well, I was surprised when he turned out
to be the liberator of the Western Isles...@0003
@000CGeese...
I must tell you something...@0003
......
...Hmm...@0003
@0009Yeah?@0003
@000C...I'm sorry.
I cannot tell you yet.@0003
@0009Geez...
Make up your mind.@0003
@000CAnyway...@0003
I hear that you have helped
the Western people as well.@0003
Both our king and prince
had wished them to be freed.@0003
@0009Well...@0003
@0017Sorry, but I don't really give a damn about
politics or other nations' statures or@0003
anything like that.@0003
I just wanted to do something for
the village that helped me out.@0003
[038F]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@010A@0009@0017...You're not gonna
leave me alone, are you?@0003
@000COf course not.
You have done me a great favor.@0003
It would be dishonoring my
family's name if I didn't return it.@0003
@0009Oh man,
you knights are so hard-headed.@0003
I swear, if you found gold on the
street, you wouldn't dare pocket it.@0003
@000CGeese...@0003
@0009Sigh....
Fine, let me think...@0003
@0017...All right, here's what I want.@0003
I want you and your king to
make your country a good one.@0003
Make it a nation that won't go
around causing stupid wars.@0003
And make it a nation where people can
travel and do business safely.@0003
I'm gonna go bankrupt if you don't
do that for me.@0003
@000C@0017@0016...Geese...@0016@0003
You deserve much better
than being a pirate.@0003
I will promise to fulfill
your requests.@0003
I shall swear my life to them!@0003
[0390]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@011B@000C@0017Excuse me.@0003
Are you Lord Douglas
of Etruria?@0003
@0009Yes, that is me.@0003
@000CSo you are the
Great General?@0003
@0009I am but a simple soldier now.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
I am Igrene,
guardian of Arcadia, in Nabata.@0003
@0009Nabata...@0003
@000CYes.@0003
I fend off invaders in
the desert heat.@0003
@0009I see.@0003
And do you need something from me?@0003
@000CI wish for you to promise me never
to attack Nabata.@0003
@0009...I cannot promise you that.@0003
@000CWhy not?

@0009We are knights...@0003
If the king orders an attack,
we must obey.@0003
@000CEven if you know it to be wrong?@0003
@0009That is part of being a knight.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
[0391]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@011B@000C@0017Lord Douglas,
about the other day...@0003
Can you promise as a nation
never to attack Nabata?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016But you have so much wealth...
Why can you not promise?@0003
@0009...Things can happen even
without the king's orders.@0003
@000CWhat does that mean...?@0003
@0009Etruria is a huge country supported by
various families of nobility.@0003
Not all nobles are kind at heart.@0003
If such nobles take over the court,
there is nothing the king or I can do.@0003
@000CBut what is there to gain
in a desert like Nabata?@0003
@0009It is not about gain...
They simply want to show their power.@0003
They do not feel their worth unless
they have someone to step on.@0003
I hear that the people in the West
suffered from similar power abuse.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
[0392]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@011B@0009@0017Igrene.@0003
@000CWhat is it,
Lord Douglas?@0003
@0009@0016...@0003
@0016I said this before,
but as an Etrurian General,@0003
I cannot promise you what you ask.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016However, I will do my best to
fulfill your request.@0003
I shall spread the word that among the
heroes who rescued the king were warriors@0003
from Nabata.@0003
I shall persuade the nobles never
to disturb your peace in Arcadia.@0003
@000C...I shall remember those words.@0003
I suppose that is all I can ask of
you now.@0003
@0009Forgive me.@0003
[0393]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@010A@0009@0017Lord Douglas!@0003
@000CPercival.@0003
We fight together again.@0003
Though it looks like this time
I am fighting in shame.@0003
@0009Please, Lord Douglas.@0003
You only did your duty as an Etrurian
General.@0003
There is nothing to be ashamed about.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016We are honored to be able
fight by your side once again.@0003
I'm sure the other Etrurians among
us feel the same way.@0003
@000CThank you...@0003
Your words are encouraging.@0003
@0009Let us fight together
for the future of Etruria!@0003
[0394]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@010A@000C@0017Percival,
how do you fare?@0003
@0009I could be doing better.
How about you, Lord Douglas?@0003
@000CI am trying my best, but...@0003
It seems I am losing the strength
I used to have.@0003
I suppose I cannot beat my age.@0003
@0009Nonsense.@0003
You are living up to the title of
the Great General, Lord Douglas.@0003
You still have a long ways to go yet.@0003
@000CI hope so.@0003
@0009Is there something on your mind?@0003
@000CNo,
that's not the case...@0003
[0395]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@010A@000C@0017Percival.@0003
It might be a bit early to say
this, but..@0003
@0009Yes?@0003
@000CI am thinking of retiring as the
Great General after this war.@0003
@0009What!?@0003
Then the highest position in the
Etrurian military would be empty!@0003
@000CI want you...
to take my place.@0003
@0009I am still young, Lord Douglas.
I cannot assume such a position...@0003
@000CYou are young?
Then what about our commander, Roy?@0003
He is much younger than you,
and he is leading all of us.@0003
@0009Yes, but...@0003
@000CThe youths will not grow if old
veterans keep hogging their positions.@0003
Percival, you are intelligent, strong
and a fine leader.@0003
Besides, once the prince returns, the
king will step down from the throne.@0003
@0009Lord Douglas!@0003
Those in service must not talk about
the inheritance of the throne...@0003
@000CIt is all right.@0003
I have been serving the king
for decades now.@0003
I know him better than anybody.@0003
I am sure once he learns of the prince's
survival, he will give the throne to him@0003
without hesitation.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016We must rebuild Etruria
alongside our new king.@0003
Etruria will be reborn again with
the help from you young ones.@0003
I will be counting on you, Percival.@0003
@0009...I shall swear my life to it.@0003
[0396]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0134@000C@0017Lord Douglas!@0003
@0009Cecilia.@0003
@000CWhy didn't you tell me?@0003
I knew you were alive, but I never
thought you were here with us.@0003
@0009Yes...
Here I am, living in shame.@0003
@000CNonsense!
You are a great asset to us all.@0003
It is an honor to fight alongside
you once again.@0003
Let us show the continent the
power of the Etrurian Generals!@0003
@0009Hm...@0003
It's not like you to be so confident,
Cecilia.@0003
@000C@0017My courage is coming from you.@0003
You've always been my goal,
and you still are.@0003
[0397]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0134@0009@0017The former Sorcery General wanted
you as his successor...@0003
But it looked like you had many
enemies at first.@0003
@000CYes, I won't deny that.@0003
Being a female general was enough
to turn people against me.@0003
I spent most of my earlier days
fighting against prejudice.@0003
@0009To be honest, I was unsure
of your abilities at first, too.@0003
@000CYes, I know.
Every time you saidア@0003
'You're weak, you don't know
how to fight.'@0003
I would bury my nose in spell
books all night.@0003
@0009That's just like you.@0003
Well, it's no wonder you were
holding a grudge against me.@0003
@000COh?@0003
I never held a grudge against you,
Lord Douglas.@0003
Do you remember that time?@0003
@0009What time?@0003
@000CThe day I enlisted, the other young
generals were teasing me about my gender.@0003
But you defended me, sayingア
'She's stronger than you all.'@0003
@0009...I'm afraid I don't remember.@0003
@000CThat's all right.
I remember perfectly.@0003
[0398]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0134@0009@0017Cecilia.@0003
@000CYes, Lord Douglas?@0003
@0009I must thank you.@0003
You've helped out an old,
worthless soldier like me.@0003
@000C...
What are you...@0003
@0009Whenever I fight,
I can feel my age.@0003
Aged soldiers are of no use.
My time has ended.@0003
It is now up to you to lead
Etruria to a bright future.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016I've never heard you say something
so stupid, Lord Douglas.@0003
@0009......@0003
@000CA bright future for Etruria?
You can talk about that after we win.@0003
Even if we do win this war, we have
much to worry about.@0003
We must rebuild our land and regain
other nations' trust.@0003
Etruria's future comes...
after all that.@0003
@0009Hm...@0003
@000CAnd you're going to put all that responsibility
on us, while you take it easy?@0003
I don't think so, Lord Douglas.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016...You really have grown
more confident.@0003
@000CIt is thanks to you.@0003
Now, if you feel defeated,
why don't you be of some use?@0003
@0009Hm...very well.@0003
I suppose I can't be outdone by
you amateurs yet.@0003
Sigh...@0003
@000C@0017Of course, Lord Douglas.@0003
[0399]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0126@0009@0017There you are, Lalum.@0003
@000CFather!
@0017Oh...@0003
@0017I mean, Lord Douglas!@0003
@0009@0017Don't worry, it is all right for people
here to know our relationship.@0003
We don't have many chances to speak in
private like this.@0003
Just call me your father, as you
always do.@0003
@000CFather...
You don't look well.@0003
Are you okay?
Do you feel sick?@0003
@0009No, I'm not sick.
I'm just a little tired.@0003
@000CCan I help?@0003
I'll do anything for you, Father!@0003
@0009Lalum...
It's all right.@0003
I feel better now after
seeing your face.@0003
You can go now...
there's no need to worry.@0003
@000CFather...@0003
[039A]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0126@000CFather!@0003
@0009@0017Lalum?
What's the matter?@0003
@000C@0017I brought you my Special Stamina Lunch
to help you keep up your energy!@0003
@0009Ah, I see.
Thank you very much, Lalum.@0003
@000CTeehee...
Well, eat up!@0003
@0009What, right here?@0003
I don't think a military general should be
sitting down eating his lunch in the@0003
middle of a battle...@0003
@000C@0017Oh...
I'm sorry!@0003
O-Of course...
You can't just start eating lunch here..@0003
I'll just be embarrassing you...
I'm...so stupid...@0003
@0009@0017...Well, it is my cute little
daughter's homemade lunch.@0003
I suppose I shouldn't be putting
it off until it gets cold.@0003
I changed my mind, I'll eat it now.
...Mmm!@0003
This looks good.@0003
@000C@0017I-It's okay, Father!
Don't force yourself!@0003
@0009@0017No, it's really delicious!
Mmm...yes.@0003
@000C@0017Father...@0003
@0009@0017Well, I can send you out to be married
any time without worries, eh?@0003
@000COh, Father!@0003
[039B]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0126@000CFather!
Father!@0003
@0009What is it, Lalum?@0003
@000CI've finally found a way to
really cheer you up!@0003
@0009@0017Lalum...
It's the feeling that counts.@0003
Your consideration is enough
encouragement.@0003
You don't have to stress yourself
out so much, Lalum.@0003
@000CI'm not stressing myself!@0003
If you look sad,
then I feel down, too.@0003
But if you're laughing,
then I feel happy as well!@0003
@0009@0017Lalum...
You're a really good girl.@0003
Thank you.@0003
@000CNo, thank you.@0003
Thank you for picking me up off the street
and treating me like your own daughter.@0003
I...@0003
I actually like myself now,
after you adopted me.@0003
@0009Lalum...@0003
@000COh!@0003
Father, you're looking all
teary again!@0003
@0009Whoops...
I must watch myself.@0003
@000COkay, now let me cheer you up
with my latest dance!@0003
[039C]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@010B@000C@0017Sir Marcus!@0003
@0009Ah, Wolt.
What is it?@0003
@000CI have something I must
ask of you.@0003
@0009Something to ask of me?@0003
@000CYes, could you...@0003
Please, could you teach me
how to use a sword?@0003
@0009...@0003
May I ask why?@0003
@000CI can only use bows.@0003
An archer is done for if he gets
ambushed in close range.@0003
I wouldn't be able to protect
Master Roy if that happens...@0003
@0009That's not true.@0003
There are certain things that
can be done only with a bow.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
@0009Besides, is there much point in learning
swordplay now, at your late age?@0003
Mediocre skill would do nothing
but hinder Master Roy.@0003
@000CWell...@0003
@0009Do not worry.@0003
You are being a great help
to Master Roy already.@0003
@000C...I wonder...@0003
[039D]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@010B@000C@0017Sir Marcus.@0003
@0009Wolt...@0003
I can tell by your face that you
still want me to teach you swordplay.@0003
@000CI just don't get it.@0003
Am I really being of that much
help to Master Roy?@0003
@0009Wolt...@0003
What do you think of us as
Lord Eliwood's knights?@0003
@000CEh...?
Well...@0003
You're all really strong,
and I look up to you.@0003
@0009Well, that's nice to hear.@0003
Still, there is one problem
with us being Eliwood's knights.@0003
@000CProblem?@0003
@0009None of us are even
close to his age.@0003
@000C!@0003
@0009Lord Eliwood's vassals...@0003
They were all old like me or far
younger than him.@0003
He had no one to joke around with, no
one to talk about his concerns with.@0003
He was always fighting on his own.@0003
@000CAlways on his own...@0003
@0009I don't want Master Roy to suffer
the same fate.@0003
You and Master Roy are the same age,
and what's more, you are milk brothers.@0003
So I want you to stay by Master Roy's
side and give him moral support.@0003
@000CMoral support?@0003
@0009That's right.@0003
Fighting well in battle is important,
but that is not all that is necessary@0003
to show your loyalty.@0003
Think about it.@0003
[039E]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@010B@0009@0017Ah, Wolt.@0003
You don't look so troubled for
a change.@0003
Well, do you still want me to
teach you how to wield a sword?@0003
@000CNo, after hearing your words, I cast
away my hesitation.@0003
I will perfect my skills with my bow,
and I will train myself so that Roy@0003
can count on me without doubt!@0003
@0009Very good.@0003
With that attitude, it looks like
I can let you take over for me.@0003
@000CWhat?
B-But if you leave now...@0003
@0009Calm down, I didn't say right at
this minute.@0003
Still, it won't be that far away.@0003
Once I am gone, you must take care
of Master Roy?@0003
@000CMe...?@0003
@0009Perhaps taking after an old man
like me would be embarrassing?@0003
@000CNo, that's not it...@0003
It's just that...
can I really do it...?@0003
@0009There now, see?
You have to fix your lack of confidence.@0003
You will worry Master Roy with an
attitude like that.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009You can do it.
Have confidence in yourself!@0003

@000CSir Alan?@0003
@0009Phew...
Ah, Wolt.@0003
@000CYou're sweating so much...
Are you all right?@0003
@0009Don't worry, I'm fine.@0003
I was just doing some practice
swings with my sword.@0003
I'm still weak.@0003
I must train myself further.@0003
@000CBut...
We're in the middle of a battle.@0003
Shouldn't you be saving your
energy for an emergency, Sir Alan?@0003
@0009Shh!
...An enemy!@0003
Let's go, Wolt!
Don't lag behind!@0003@0011
@000CWha-?
Y-Yes, Sir Alan!@0003
[03A0]
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@010B@0009@0017998!@0003
...999!@0003
...1000!...@0003
@000CSir Alan!@0003
@0009Ah...Wolt...@0003
Good to see you...again...@0003
@000CD-Do you really have
to go so far?@0003
You'll be done if you
go into battle like that!@0003
@0009I know it's crazy...
But I have to do it.@0003
Don't you feel the size of this
continent as fight through it?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
@0009We must become stronger,
even if we go over our limits.@0003
We are the ones who must become
stronger to protect Master Roy.@0003
@000CYes!@0003
@0009All right...
I've caught my breath.@0003
Let's go!@0003@0011
@000CHe's amazing...@0003
I can't be losing, either!@0003
[03A1]

@0009Wolt?@0003
@000CSir Alan!@0003
@0009Are you training as well?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
After watching, I couldn't just
sit around waiting.@0003
I have to become strong
to protect Master Roy as well.@0003
@0009I see.
That's the spirit!@0003
Become strong,
and surprise Master Roy!@0003
@000CYes!@0003
[03A2]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@010B@0009@0017@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Sir Lance?@0003
@0009@0016...I get it now.@0003
@000C@0016Uh...Sir Lance?@0003
@0009Ah, Wolt.@0003
Sorry,
I was thinking some things over.@0003
@000CHave I disturbed you?@0003
@0009No, I have reached my conclusion.
It is all right now.@0003
@000CI...see.@0003
@0009Did you need something,
Wolt?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
I want to learn by your side.@0003
Teach me to fight like you, so I can
become stronger and protect Master Roy!@0003
[03A3]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@010B@000C@0017Sir Lance?
What are you doing?@0003
@0009Ah, Wolt.@0003
I was keeping a record of
this battle.@0003
@000CA record?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
In one of my favorite books, there
is a quote from a famous general.@0003
It saysア@0003
'The most important thing in battle
is information.'@0003
Therefore, I've been keeping track
of who does what in which location,@0003
for both our allies and enemies.
It might be of use someday.@0003
@000CI see.@0003
@0009In the battles ahead of us, one
mistake could lead us to our deaths.@0003
We must pay careful attention to every
aspect of battle under Master Roy.@0003
@000CY-Yes!@0003
@0009...It's time.@0003
I must be off.@0003@0011
@000CHe's amazing...
I can't be losing, either!@0003
[03A4]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@010B@000C@0017Oh, Sir Lance.@0003
@0009Wolt.
...Are you all right?@0003
Your eyes seem to be
rather red...@0003
@000CYes!
I'm fine.@0003
I was just reading the book on
war tactics that you lent me.@0003
@0009Well, good job.
Were you reading it all night?@0003
@000CYes!@0003
@0009All right,
you might be interested in this next.@0003
It's by the same author, and he describes
his ideas in detail over the course of@0003
24 volumes.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016If you read this, then you should be
able to master the basics fairly easily.@0003
After that, we can go into more advanced
details...Wolt?@0003
Are you listening?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016Y...Yes!
Of course!@0003
I'll do my best...@0003
[03A5]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@010C@000C@0017Oh!
There you are!@0003
@0009@0017Oh, hello, Dorothy.@0003
@000C@0017Where were you, Father Saul?@0003
You just go wandering off
without saying anything...@0003
@0009I do not call it 'wandering off',
Dorothy.@0003
I was diligently doing my missionary
work at the villages on the way here.@0003
@000C...Were you really doing your job?@0003
@0009@0017Of course.@0003
However, while I was doing my job,
a young maiden was being harassed@0003
by a very rude man.@0003
@000C@0017You mean yourself?@0003
@0009@0017Do I not have any trust at all?@0003
Anyway, I drove off the man and
rescued the maiden.@0003
I must admit, I acted exactly
like a holy man ought to behave.@0003
@000C@0017Really?
You're not exactly very strong.@0003
How did you do it?@0003
@0009@0017I went to the man and clung to
him, crying,@0003
'I thought we loved each other,
and now you are rejecting me?'@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016The man fled with haste.@0003
However, the maiden was also
gone when I looked back.@0003
[03A6]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@010C@000C@0017Father Saul!
I've heard the rumors!@0003
@0009What is it, Dorothy?@0003
Can I not have at least some
peace and quiet?@0003
@000CYou can't fool me with that calm
attitude.@0003
I've heard what they say about you.@0003
You're trying to ask out every girl
in this army.@0003
@0009@0017There is a misunderstanding.@0003
I was just trying to
tell them of God's love...@0003
@000C@0017No, not this time!@0003
@0009@0017What do you mean?@0003
@000C@0017I've heard that excuse before.
Can't you think of something better?@0003
@0009@0017Hm...@0003
Then please wait a minute
while I think of one.@0003
@000C@0017What's the point
if you think of one now!?@0003
@0009...Dorothy,
why are you so upset?@0003
This happens all the time.@0003
@000CThat's the problem!@0003
People would misjudge the Elimine
Church if they see you all the time.@0003
@0009@0017I am so insulted!
I am doing my job properly, Dorothy.@0003
Have you not noticed the sharp increase
in our female followers recently?@0003
@000C@0017Don't you understand?
If you're just asking every girl out...@0003
@0009?@0003
@000CI've had it!@0003
You'll have a lot to listen to when
you come back to the church tonight.@0003@0011
@0009...Sigh...@0003
[03A7]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@010C@0009Dorothy...@0003
@000C@0017What is it?@0003
I haven't heard a valid excuse
about the other day yet.@0003
@0009Dorothy, I am sorry...@0003
I am sorry that I...could not
understand your feelings...@0003
@000C...Huh?@0003
@0009I see what you were trying
to say the other day.@0003
You wanted to sayア@0003
'If you're asking every girl out...
why don't you do the same to me?'@0003
@000CWha...!?@0003
@0009Dorothy, I never knew that you
had such strong feelings for me...@0003
@000CAh, er, um...
Th-That was just...@0003
@0009But I am a servant of God...@0003
I must be equally caring to all women.
Please forgive me, Dorothy...@0003
@000CUm...Um,
er... I...@0003
@0009How did that sound, Dorothy?@0003
@000C@0017...Wh-What?@0003
@0009@0017I pondered a lot, but that was the
best excuse I could come up with.@0003
@000C@0017......@0003
@0009@0016V-Violence is not appropriate,
Dorothy.@0016
Our loving God surely would not
approve of someone pointing their@0003
bow at an ally...@0003
@000CI don't care!@0003
You better get out of my sight
before I shoot you!@0003
@0009Sigh...@0003
What are you so upset about?@0003
@000CIt's your fault!@0003@0009@0011@000C@0011
[03A8]
@0009@0010@011A@0005@000F@0017Look out!@0003
@0009!@0003
@000F@0010@010C@0080@000EI-I-I'm terribly sorry!@0003
I was aiming for an enemy,
but the arrow flew over here...@0003
Oh, what am I going to do?
Are you hurt?@0003
@0009I'm fine.
It didn't even touch me.@0003
@000CI, I...
I'm so sorry!@0003
@0009There is no need to apologize.@0003
Things like this often happen
on the battlefield.@0003
@000CBut...!@0003
@0009Even if I did get hit by your arrow,
it would partly my responsibility@0003
for not paying attention to
my surroundings.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
@0009Never let your mind wander in battle.
That is a rule.@0003
So don't be too upset about it.@0003
All right?@0003
@000C...Yes, I understand.@0003
I'm probably being more of a
nuisance sitting here mulling over it.@0003
I'll try harder next time!@0003
[03A9]
@000C@0010@010CSigh...@0003
@000C@0017That last shot was just luck...@0003
I have to practice more.@0003
Perhaps I should aim@0005
more like this...@0003@0002
Oh!
General Percival!@0003
@0009@0010@011A
Training?
Very good.@0003
@000CY-Yes, thank you!@0003
I sometimes make mistakes like I did
last time, so I thought I should@0003
train myself more so I wouldn't
be a hindrance to everyone else...@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
Dorothy, I've been thinking.@0003
You should relax more
when you shoot.@0003
@000CHuh...?@0003
You were watching how I fight!?@0003
@0009I always try to watch and
understand how my comrades fight.@0003
I was looking for the chance to
tell you this, but I can see that@0003
you tend to panic when you fight.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
Yes, that's true.@0003
I tend to get scared in an actual
battle, and I get nervous and can't@0003
move like I would like to...@0003
@0009...Archers don't have to come out
front, they stay back and cover for us.@0003
You must tell yourself that there
is nothing to be afraid of.@0003
We will defend the front lines.@0003
@000C! ...Yes! I will!@0003
[03AA]
@000C@0010@010C...Yes!@0003
Yes, that was great!@0003
@0009@0010@011A@0017You seem to have improved,
Dorothy.@0003
@000C@0017General Percival!@0003
I'm trying to relax when I shoot,
as you said.@0003
I think...
I think I'm getting better at it!@0005@0003
@0009@0017You originally seemed to have talent
with the bow.@0003
It was just a matter of getting your
confidence together, and now that you@0003
have, you'll be improving more and more.@0003
@000CI can relax if I think that the others
are defending the front lines...@0003
It seems that you can sometimes
feel safe even on the battlefield.@0003
@0009Ah, but that is the same for
us up front as well.@0003
We would not be able to charge in like we
do, if we didn't have adequate support@0003
from the back lines.@0003
@000C...Am I being of use to
you too, General Percival?@0003
@0009Yes, you're helping me out a
great deal.@0003
I shall be looking forward to
your support in future battles.@0003
@000CYes!@0003
[03AB]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010C@000C@0017Bishop Yodel?@0003
@0009Ah, Dorothy.@0003
You do not look so well.
What is the matter?@0003
@000CDo you know why I can't
use the sacred healing staves?@0003
@0009Hm...@0003
@000CI want to help injured people by using
the staves like Father Saul and you.@0003
I've been praying every day, and I don't
think I've done anything bad, either.@0003
@0009Yes.
Your faith is an example to us all.@0003
@000CBut I still can't help the injured...
I want to heal them, but I can't.@0003
Will I never have the power?
Am I not worthy to be God's servant?@0003
@0009No, that is not the case.@0003
Do you know the story of the owl,
and the eagle?@0003
@000CNo, I don't.@0003
Please tell it to me,
Bishop Yodel.@0003
@0009It is a story of a time when Saint
Elimine still walked the Earth.@0003
One day during Saint Elimine's
journeys, an owl approached@0003
her from the forest.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009The owl asked herア@0003
'I wish to go to the land of God.
Would you show me the way?'@0003
Saint Elimine thought for a
moment, and repliedア@0003
'God's domain lies high above
the clouds.@0003
Your wings would not be strong
enough to take you there.'@0003
The owl was very disappointed,
and returned to the forest.@0003
@000CPoor thing...@0003
@0009Yes, indeed.@0003
We shall continue the
story some other time.@0003
@000CSome other time?
Why?@0003
@0009Do you not remember the
teachings of Saint Elimine?@0003
You must not try to
understand things in a hurry.@0003
You must think over what you are
told and develop your own opinions.@0003
@000COh...right.@0003
Then please continue the story
another day, Bishop Yodel.@0003
@0009Of course, Dorothy.
I promise you that.@0003
[03AC]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010C@0009@0017...After parting with the owl, Saint
Elimine continued on her journey.@0003
The next day, an eagle swooped
down from the mountain.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009The eagle asked herア@0003
'I wish to go to the land of God.
'Would you show me the way?'@0003
Saint Elimine thought for
a moment, and repliedア@0003
'God's domain lies in a
distant land beyond the night.@0003
Your eyes would not be able
to guide you through the dark.@0003
The eagle was very disappointed,
and returned to the mountain.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016However, the sympathetic and kind
Saint Elimine could not ignore@0003
the two birds.@0003
She backtracked, and brought the
owl and eagle together.@0003
She then told themア
'Journey to the land of God together.'@0003
@000CTogether...@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
The two birds traveled to God's
land together.@0003
The eagle used his powerful wings to
carry the owl, and the owl used his@0003
great eyes to guide the eagle
through the night.@0003
Together, they were able to reach
God's domain.@0003
That is the end of the story.
Do you understand, Dorothy?@0003
@000CWell...@0003
Sort of.@0003
[03AD]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010C@000CBishop Yodel!@0003
@0009@0017Yes, Dorothy?@0003
@000C@0017About that story...@0003
@0009@0017Yes?@0003
@000C@0017I thought about it, but...
I'm not very smart...@0003
@0017So I still don't get its point...@0003
I sort of have an idea of what it
might be about, but...@0003
@0009@0017Then you have an answer, Dorothy.@0003
A story is just a story.
It has no definite meaning.@0003
Each person interprets the story
and comes up with his own answers.@0003
@000COh, good.@0003
Bishop Yodel,
I think I feel better now.@0003
@0009Do you?
Very good, Dorothy.@0003
@000COh, what did Saint Elimine do
after that?@0003
Does the story continue?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
The journey of Saint Elimine is
a long one.@0003
The next day when Saint Elimine
was continuing on her travels...@0003
[03AE]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@010DGeneral Percival!
It is good to see you again.@0003
@0009@0017Klein.
It is good to see you are well.@0003
It seems that you've gotten
quite used to your position now.@0003
@000C@0017Yes.@0003
Although, I'm still one of the least
experienced and weakest generals...@0003
@0009@0017Well, from the way I see it, those
working under you are the luckier ones.@0003
@000CI hope so too,
General Percival.@0003
@0009...How have you been doing?@0003
@000C@0017What?@0003
@0009@0017What do you think
about this army?@0003
@000C@0017Well...@0003
Frankly, I fee more at home
here than in the Etrurian army.@0003
Perhaps it is because of General Roy..@0003
@0009@0017...I see.@0003
@000C@0017How do you feel,
General Percival?@0003
@0009@0017I can't say that I feel
completely comfortable here.@0003
@000CYou can't?@0003
@0009It is probably because what I seek
from an army doesn't exist here.@0003
@000CSo...
You can't get used to this army?@0003
@0009...No, it's a little different
from that.@0003
It is just that I am and will
always be an Etrurian knight.@0003
I am unable to bend my
standards so easily.@0003
[03AF]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@010D@0009@0017...How do you feel about the
coup d'etat in Etruria?@0003
@000C...I still understand that Bern was
doing some things behind the scenes,@0003
but still...@0003
I never would have imagined that the
Etrurian Court would divide into two@0003
hostile sides.@0003
To tell the truth,
I'm still not over it.@0003
I...I never thought that there would
be so many people who give in to@0003
greed so easily...@0003
@0009Etruria had not known war for
a very long time.@0003
Thus, blinded by peace, we didn't
notice the men scheming.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
A conflict would have broken
out even without Bern's help.@0003
@0009Once this war is over, I will return
and devote my life to rebuild Etruria.@0003
@000C@0017Of course, General Percival.@0003
I am prepared to give my life for
that cause as well.@0003
@0009@0017Klein.@0003
I want you to seek a different path.@0003
@000CWhat!?@0003
@0009Once I return to Etruria, I
plan to dismiss all but those few whom@0003
I can put absolute trust in to
be loyal to the king and country.@0003
I will do anything to maintain
mutual trust among the king's servants.@0003
@000CGeneral Percival...
Don't be ridiculous!@0003
@0009! Klein...@0003
@000C@0017...Please, relax a little.@0003
With your ability, you won't have
@0017to go to such extreme measures.@0003
I was holding this in because
we are at war, but...@0003
I'll say it now.@0003
I miss the days when I could look
up to you as an older brother.@0003
The days when we were more relaxed,@0003
and sometimes even laughed it up
together...@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000C@0017Once this war ends,
let us return and celebrate the@0003
prosperity of the new Kingdom of
Etruria together...in laughter.@0003
[03B0]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@010D@000CGeneral Percival?@0003
@0009@0017Klein.@0003
Is something wrong?@0003
@000C@0017No.
I just saw you, so...@0003
@0009@0017I see.@0003
@000C@0017You know, I was thinking...@0003
Before the coup d'etat, we never
were working together in the same@0003
mission.@0003
But now, here we are, fighting
alongside each other, after we have@0003
both left the Etrurian military and
are under General Roy's command.@0003
@0009@0017Hm, yes...
Fate can work in strange ways.@0003
@000C@0017Yes.
Oh, on a different topic...@0003
Have your favorite foods
changed over the recent years?@0003
@0009@0017?@0003
...No.
Why?@0003
@000C@0017It's just that the cook was a@0003
little worried.@0003
He says that since you are
expressionless no matter what@0003
you eat, he never knows what
to give you.@0003
@0009@0017Expressionless?
...Do you think so?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, very much so,
General Percival.@0003
Even when you have wine, your
expression stays the same no@0003
matter what you drink.@0003
If you stop making expressions,
you'll forget how to make them.@0003
@0009@0017Expressions are not things
that can be forgotten.@0003
@000C@0017I wouldn't be so sure about
that with you, General Percival.@0003
@0009...Well, well.
Getting fresh, are we?@0003
@000CHaha...I guess it looks
like I need not worry.@0003
[03B1]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@010D
@000CExcuse me.@0003
@0009@0017Do you need something,
General Klein?@0003
@000CDieck...
You don't recognize me?@0003
@0009...Well well.@0003
I never would've thought that
you still remember me.@0003
@000C!
I recognized you at once!@0003
You didn't seem to notice me,
so I decided to talk to you...@0003
@0009@001713 years...@0003
Little Master Klein is all grown
up, I see.@0003
@000CYou can stop calling me
Little Master.@0003
I'm already 19 now.@0003
I've been working as a general
under the king himself.@0003
@0009Yeah, I know.
You've become quite an individual.@0003
How are Lord Pent and his wife?@0003
@000CThey're laid-back as usual.@0003
Regardless of the coup d'etat,
they still don't seem to@0003
be that concerned at all.@0003
I really envy them sometimes.@0003
@0009Well...
You've become pretty impressive yourself.@0003
@000CWhat?
What do you mean?@0003
@0009Well,
we can talk another time.@0003@0011
@000C@0017Dieck!
But we just met...@0003
[03B2]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@010D@0009@0017Klein!
Don't come out front that much.@0003
@000C@0017This is still a safe position.@0003
@0009@0017You bowmen should stay
in the back and cover for us.@0003
There's no need for you to come
out and put yourself in danger.@0003
@000CDieck, I told you, I'm not a child
any more.@0003
Until now I've been leading a squad
and fighting in the front all the time.@0003
@0009Sorry, but you're still
'Little Master Klein' in my eyes.@0003
If I let you get hurt,
I wouldn't know what@0003
to say to Lord Pent.@0003
@000C...If you're being so considerate, then
you should come back to our mansion.@0003
@0017Dieck, when this war ends, do you
want to return home with me?@0003
Father and Mother would certainly
appreciate it.@0003
@0009Klein,
I appreciate your consideration.@0003
@0017But if you really care about
your household, then you'll stop chatting@0003
with a lowly mercenary like me.
It won't be good for your future.@0003
@000C!? What...@0003
@0009You're only talking to me
like this because we're in a war.@0003
Got it?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
[03B3]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@010D@000C@0017Dieck.@0003
@0009...Klein, I told you not to
come talk to me this often.@0003
@000C...I wanted to tell you a story.@0003
I want you to listen because we're
in such turbulent times.@0003
...It was 15 years ago, at Aquleia's
best arena.@0003
A noble's child was attacked by one
of the lions that were used in the@0003
opening show.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016A young pitfighter was the one who
saved the child.@0003
Ordinarily, he was a skilled swordfighter
who could defeat men twice his size@0003
with ease.@0003
But this time he was up against a
lion, so he didn't come out unscathed.@0003
He was wounded all over his body, and
his face suffered four deep scars.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016The noble hired the swordsman who
saved his child into his service.@0003
For several years, the young man
served as the family's pitfighter@0003
and spread his name at the arena.@0003
But one day, he suddenly bought
his freedom and left.
The child, who looked up to the
pitfighter as if he were his@0003
real brother thought that he
 was betrayed, and was saddened.@0003
...But now I understand.@0003
You were thinking the best for
our family..@0003
@0009You...You were much too kind to
me, a simple servant.@0003
Lord Pent and his wife raised me
as if I were their real child,@0003
regardless of the complaints and
finger-pointing going on around them.@0003
...That's why I left.@0003
@000CI understand how you feel.
But I don't agree with you.@0003
@0009!?@0003
@000CYou were always thinking
the best for us...@0003
But did you ever consider the fact
that we were concerned for you also?@0003
I don't want us to be in a relation
in which we ignore each other...@0003
@0009@0017...Looks like I was being selfish.@0003
@000C!@0003
Then you'll be with us like a
family again?@0003
@0009Yeah, you win Little Master Klein.@0003
I'll be sure to show my face to@0003
Lord Pent whenever I get the chance.@0003
[03B4]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@010D@0009That was a rough battle, master.@0003
Would you care to soothe your
tired heart?@0003
@000COh, you're...@0003
You're the bard that is always
with General Roy.@0003
@0009Yes.
My name is Elphin.@0003
@000C...Elphin, might you be...
No...that's impossible.@0003
@0017Forgive me,
Please forget it.@0003
@0009...I look very much like@0003
someone you know...
Am I right?@0003
@000C! It...can't be.@0003
@0009@0017Here I am standing right in front
of you, telling you myself, yet you@0003
do not believe me.@0003
Did my servants lack trust in me,
Klein?@0003
@000C@0017Prince Mildain!@0003
It is you!
Oh...!@0003
@0017I'm so glad you're in
one piece, your Highness!@0003
@0009You seem to have
grown while I was gone.@0003
@000C@0017Etruria has changed greatly
during the year you were gone,@0003
your Highness.@0003
@0009Yes, I know.
I am sorry to put you through it.@0003
@000CWell, I was stationed in the Western
Isles, so it didn't affect me too much.@0003
@0017But...you're really alive...@0003
I'm sure all of the Etrurian people
will welcome your return!@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
[03B5]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@010D@000CPr-...
I mean, Master Elphin!@0003
There you are.@0003
@0009@0017@0017...General Klein,
might you spare a moment?@0003
@000C@0017@0017Yes?
What is it?@0003
@0009@0017...Master.@0003
@000CMaster?
What do you mean?@0003
@0009@0017...You don't understand?@0003
@000C@0017@0016......@0016
Have I...done something wrong?@0003
@0009@0017...Someone is coming.@0003
We shall continue this some
other day.@0003
@000C@0016...?@0016@0003
[03B6]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@010D@0009@0017...We can have some
privacy here.@0003
@000CPr-...Master Elphin,
you wanted to speak with me?@0003
Is it about Etruria?@0003
@0009No.
It is about the other day.@0003
@000COh...@0003
Are you talking about the
'Master' thing?@0003
@0009Do you not think it is strange
for an Etrurian noble to call a@0003
simple bard a 'Master'?@0003
@000COh...!
Yes, you're right!@0003
Forgive me.@0003
I shall call you Sir
Elphin instead...@0003
@0009No.
Just 'Elphin' will do.@0003
@000CThat will not do!@0003
Even if you are in disguise,
I cannot address my prince@0003
simply by name.@0003
@0009@0017Hm...
...You haven't changed at all.@0003
@000C@0017???@0003
@0009@0017Huh?@0003
Do you remember how you used to often
come to the palace with your father?@0003
@000C@0017Yes...@0003
I've been going to the palace as
long as I remember.@0003
Since I had no siblings, I couldn't
help but think of how cute you were@0003
as a toddler.
And I was still young and foolish,@0003
so I told your fatherア 'Your son
hall now be my younger brother!@0003
'He must live in the palace from
now on.'@0003
@000C@0017You, the prince,
said that?@0003
@0009@0017Yes.
I was a fool.@0003
Of course, your father didn't know
what to say.@0003
And then you spoke up.@0003
@000C@0017I did...?@0003
@0009@0017Yes.@0003
And you said the same words.
'That will not do.'@0003
@000C@0017...I don't remember.@0003
@0009@0017'I'm going to be your knight,
so that will not do.'@0003
Those were your exact words.
You also saidア@0003
'Chose someone else for your
brother!'@0003
@000C@0017...I-I was so rude...
I, uh...Forgive me, your Highness..@0003
@0009@0017Do not worry about it.
I'm glad you haven't changed.@0003
...When I came back from the@0002
@0017brink of death, the world@0003
looked so different.@0003
I'm glad some things are still
the same.@0003
@000CPrince Mildain...@0003
[03B7]
@0009@0010@010D@000C@0010@0128@0009@0017Tate.@0003
@000C@0017General Klein!
Is something wrong?@0003
@0009@0017No, I'm fine.
I just wanted to tell you something.@0003
@000C@0017Tell me something?@0003
@0009@0017Yes.
When I hired you and your squad...@0003
I was hiring you as an Etrurian
General.@0003
@000C???@0003
Yes, of course.@0003
@0009So if I weren't an
Etrurian General,@0003
you would be free to do
as you wish.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I know.@0003
That's what I told my squad
when we joined this army.@0003
@0009@0017Well, you don't seem to be taking
advantage of that freedom.@0003
@000C?
That's not the case.@0003
@0009Well...
If you say so.@0003
@000C...What are you trying to say?@0003
@0009No, it's nothing.
Don't worry about it.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
[03B8]
@0009@0010@010D@000C@0010@0128@000C@0017General Klein.@0003
@0009Tate?
What's wrong?@0003
@000CIt's about what you
said the other day...@0003
@0009The other day?@0003
@000CYou said that I wasn't
taking advantage of my freedom...@0003
@0009Oh, that.@0003
@000CI wasn't quite sure what you
meant, so I wanted to ask you.@0003
@0009@0017Well, since you're free to do what
you want, there's no need for you@0003
to stay here.@0003
That's all.@0003
@000C!!@0003
@0017...Does that mean that
you don't need my help?@0003
@0009@0017No, that's not what I meant.
Tate, you're a mercenary.@0003
Staying with this army isn't
going to get you much money.@0003
So if you're just fighting
alongside us out of guilt@0003
or a feeling of responsibility,
I just wanted you to know that@0003
you shouldn't feel that way.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, you're right.@0003
Perhaps it is inconvenient to
stay with this low paying army.@0003
But I'm staying with you out of
my own will.@0003
Please don't worry about it.@0003
@0009Oh, all right, then.
I'm sorry if I have been a bother.@0003
@000CNo, not at all.@0003
[03B9]
@0009@0010@010D@000C@0010@0128@0009Tate, when this war ends, I
could help you find an army@0003
that pays well.@0003
@000C@0017...Why?@0003
@0009@0017Well, even though you said that
you're fighting with us on your@0003
own will, my being here is still
one of the reasons you stayed.@0003
I just thought that I should
compensate by helping out with@0003
your future plans...@0003
@000C@0017...I can do that on my own.@0003
I appreciate your consideration,
but please do not worry about it.@0003
@0009@0017But...@0003
@000C@0017Or is my being here a
hindrance to you?@0003
@0009N-No!
Not at all!@0003
@000CThen why are you telling
me things like that!@0003
@0009...What's the matter, Tate?
How come you're so upset..?@0003
@000CEver since this other day,
all you've been talking about is@0003
getting me out of this army...
Away from you!@0003
@0009What?
Well, I...@0003
@000CI chose to stay by your side
because I love you!@0003
But you...
You're so inconsiderate!@0003
@0009Um, well...
I'm sorry.@0003
It's just that...I didn't..
know you felt that way about me..@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016So...@0003
You know, Tate, you're to
blame as well!@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009You keep calling me
'General Klein, General Kleinア'@0003
like you want to keep your
distance with me!@0003
That's why you make me think
that you're simply tagging@0003
along out of responsibility.@0003
@000CB-But...@0003
@0009@0017No 'General' from now on.
Just call me Klein, okay?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, General Klein.@0003
@0009@0017No.
Klein.@0003
@000C@0017Huh?
@0017Oh...Yes...Klein.@0003
[03BA]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010E@0009Saul...@0003
@000CBishop Yodel...@0003
Do you need something from me?@0003
@0009No...
I thought we might talk a bit.@0003
Are you properly performing your
missionary duties?@0003
@000COf course, Bishop Yodel.@0003
Due to my hard work, we are getting
more followers every day.@0003
Please, take a look at this list...@0003
@0009...Hm.@0003
It seems that there are an
overwhelmingly large number of@0003
ladies' names on this list.@0003
@000CWell, this,
you see...is that.@0003
@0009That?@0003
@000CSo...@0003
They must have understood my
pure intentions more than@0003
the gentlemen did.@0003
@0009Oh, I see.
Very good.@0003
@000CYes, thank you.@0003
@0009But Saul, please do not forget
that your main purpose is your@0003
missionary work.@0003@0011
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016Can't beat him,
can I...@0003
[03BB]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010E@0009Saul, how is your mission
coming along?@0003
@000CAh yes,
as I notified you in my letter,@0003
Master Roy is in possession
of the Fire Emblem now.@0003
@0009Has anything else happened
worth noting?@0003
@000CNo, not really.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
I am sorry to put you through
all this, Saul.@0003
@000CNo, please don't be.@0003
I did it all for our loving
Saint Elimine.@0003
@0009Yes, of course.
That is very noble of you.@0003
...Oh, Saul.@0003
We have been getting complaints
from Master Merlinus that you are@0003
following Princess Guinevere
everywhere she goes...@0003
@000CWell, Bishop Yodel,
that is my mission.@0003
@0009Saul, your mission was to keep
an eye on the Fire Emblem.@0003
And you mentioned it is now in
the hands of Master Roy, not@0003
Princess Guinevere.@0003
@000CWell, yes,
you are right.@0003
But Bishop Yodel,
please consider this.@0003
I do not think that should be
following Master Roy everywhere just@0003
because he has the Emblem.@0003
That would surely go against
my ethics.@0003
@0009@0017...Saul?@0003
[03BC]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010E@0009Saul, perhaps it is time to
relieve you from your mission.@0003
@000CWhat do you mean,
Bishop Yodel?@0003
@0009I believe I know Master Roy
well enough to trust him.@0003
The Fire Emblem will be safe
in his hands.@0003
What we were fearing surely
not happen now.@0003
Do you not agree?@0003
@000CPerhaps you are right.@0003
..However, I wish to continue
my mission a little longer.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
@000COf course I understand what
you are saying, Bishop Yodel.@0003
Master Roy is certainly a
noble person.@0003
Still...@0003
I think this world is a bit too
ugly yet for Master Roy to handle.@0003
I think that I know that more than
the other priests...@0003
@0009Saul...@0003
@000CWell, I am still a youngster.
You may forget what I said.@0003
@0009I see...
All right then.@0003
...Oh, Saul.@0003
I recently found this...@0003
@000COh?
This is...@0003
@0009'All wounds treated freely.
Special discounts for new members now.@0003
Sign up today!'@0003
This...treating God like some sort of
vulnerary.@0003
I certainly do not want to think
that someone serving God would@0003
write something like this...@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009...Saul, would you like to listen
to my lecturing for a little while?@0003
@000COh, Bishop Yodel, I am certainly
not worthy of having the privilege@0003
of listening to your...@0003
@0009@0017...Would you like to listen?@0003
@000C...Yes, yes I would,
Bishop Yodel...@0003
[03BD]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@010E@000COh, dear God...
To have met such a beautiful lady...@0003
Dear God, do you understand my
happiness at this moment?@0003
I am a witness to your work of
beauty standing in front of me...@0003
@0009@0017Oh, you are Saul,
are you not?@0003
Good day.@0003
@000C......
Oh...Uh, yes, good day.@0003
@0009I'm sorry, I was thinking some things
over, and didn't hear what you were@0003
saying.@0003
Would you please repeat what you
said to me?@0003
@000C@0017...Well...@0003
Anyway, General Cecilia, seeing that
we are both servants of God, might@0003
you be interested in having dinner
with me some time?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, I'm sorry.@0003
I am not a servant of God.@0003
@000C@0017Of course you are, my lady.
Everyone in this world is serving God.@0003
@0009@0017Do you think so?@0003
@000C@0017Yes.
So can we make arrangements for dinner?@0003
@0009@0017I suppose I'll think about it.@0003
[03BE]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@010E@000CAh,
General Cecilia!@0003
@0009@0017Oh, Saul.@0003
@000C@0017I have had the privilege
of meeting you again...@0003
It must be your overwhelming
beauty, do you not agree?@0003
@0009@0017Are you always like that?@0003
@000C@0017Well, yes I am.@0003
However, I am only trying to make
you feel comfortable around me...@0003@0002
Ah, yes!@0003
We must decide on a date for our
dinner meeting.@0003
Have you thought about it?@0003
@0009@0017Dinner?@0003
@000CT-This cannot be!
Have you forgotten?@0003
The other day, we met and we agreed
that there is no person in this@0003
world that does not serve God.@0003@0009@0017Ah, yes..
I think I can recall vaguely...@0003
@000C@0017Vaguely?@0003
@0009I'm sorry.
I'm busy with the battle.@0003
@000COh...I see.@0003
@0017Well then, I suppose it shall
have to be another day.@0003
But please do not forget
next time.@0003
@0009@0017Yes.
I'll try not to.@0003
[03BF]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@010E@000CAh!
General Cecilia!@0003
@0009Saul.@0003
@000CI trust that you have thought
about our dinner meeting?@0003
@0009@0017Ah, yes.@0003
@0017Very well, I shall invite you
to my manor when the war ends.@0003
@000CI shall be looking forward to that!@0003
It is not ever day that one invited
to a high-class Etrurian noble@0003
mansion.@0003
@0009@0017But you might want to bear in
mind that my father can be a@0003
little...difficult.@0003
@000CDifficult?
What do you mean?@0003
@0009Well, ordinarily my father is
a very kind and caring man.@0003
However, once when I was still
a child, I invited a male friend of@0003
mine to our house.@0003
When he saw that, he just drew his
sword on my friend.@0003
@000CUm...@0003
Is that really a matter of
being difficult?@0003
@0009My father lost his temper,
and so we tried to calm him down.@0003
However, it was not easy.@0003
The tea spilled everywhere,
the table was sliced in two,@0003
and what was supposed to be a
dinner party became more like@0003
an arena.@0003
My friend somehow escaped with
his life.@0003
That will always be a day to
remember.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
But my father is still on the
good end.@0003
@0009@0016You see, my grandfather can be even
more difficult than my father...@0003
@000C@0017Oh, I just remembered!@0003
I had some work left at the church
that I must attend to.@0003
I'm terribly sorry, but since it seems
that arranging a dinner meeting would@0003
be difficult, I shall be off now...@0003
Good day, General Cecilia!@0003@0011
@0009Oh?
Well I'm sorry to hear that.@0003
[03C0]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@011B@0009Oh, dear God...@0003
@000C?@0003
@0009That I am able to meet such a
beautiful woman...@0003
This day must surely be blessed.@0003
@000C@0017...Do you need something?@0003
@0009@0017Yes, indeed!
..Ah, before that...@0003
I am Saul.
It would be an honor to know your name.@0003
@000C@0017I am Igrene.
So...what do you need?@0003
@0009@0017Ah, such a beautiful name,
as I imagined.@0003
@0009Igrene...@0003
If I were to describe the pleasure
of hearing such an elegant name...@0003
@000C@0017No, there is no need
to describe it.@0003
Do you need something?@0003
Do you know of the Elimine Church,
Igrene?@0003
It is very popular among the nobility,
because when you pray deeply all of@0003
your dreams will come true immediately!@0003
@000C@0017Oh...is that what
you want..@0003
I'm sorry, but I don't
believe in God...@0003
@0009@0017Oh, but you must.@0003
If you don't follow the Elimine
Church, you will be cursed!@0003
@000C@0017...Is that the kind of God
that you follow?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, no, I was just kidding around.@0003
How about if have dinner together
some evening, and I can teach you@0003
about God's love...@0003@000C@0011
@0009Um, Igrene?
Where are you going?@0003
[03C1]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@011B@0009Ah, Igrene!@0003
@000C@0017...You again.@0003
@0009@0017It is truly a miracle that we
can meet again like this.@0003
God must have guided you
towards me.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, that's nice.
Well then, I must be going...@0003
@0009Oh, please wait!@0003
It is a wonderful thing to believe,
Igrene!@0003
@000CYes, I know.
I used to believe in God as well.@0003
Although it is a different God
than yours.@0003
I think I was fairly serious about it.@0003
@0009Really?@0003
Why did you stop believing?@0003
@000CSeveral years ago...
I stopped praying.@0003
It was after I lost a loved one
in battle.@0003
@0009...I see.@0003
@000CThose who pray to God expect something
in return.@0003
But they will never receive anything,
and that causes people to hate God.@0003
I think that it would be a lot less
trouble to think that no being exists@0003
in the first place.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016Yes...
You are right.@0003
@000C...Is it all right for a priest
like you to be saying that?@0003
@0009@0017It is all right,
I am an open-minded person.@0003
@0017However,
Saint Elimine did say this:@0003
'God does not help us
because He believes in us.'@0003
@000CBelieves...in us?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
[03C2]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@011B@000C@0017Father Saul.@0003
@0009@0017Oh, Igrene!
What is the matter?@0003
Ah, so you finally decided give
in to the urge, and see me...@0003
@000C@0017It is about what you said the
other day...@0003
You said that God does not help
us because He believes in us.@0003
@0009@0016This is what Saint Elimine said.@0003
God who created this world is all-
powerful.@0003
He can change people and the world.@0003
He can alter us humans so that we
so that we would not be fighting@0003
like this.@0003
However, is that really the right
way?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Humans that act according to God's
@0002will alone would be mindless puppets.@0003
God believes that we humans can change,
that we can learn from our mistakes.@0003
God knows that we can overcome our
hardships to achieve harmony.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
I don't believe in God, but I respect
people who think as you do, Father Saul.@0003
I must be off now...@0003@0011
@0009@0017Please, it is my pleasure to be
able to help you.@0003
Now, we can go on to discuss our
dinner meeting.@0003
@0017...Igrene?
Where are you going?@0003
[03C3]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@010F@000CAre you Father Saul?@0003
I am Ellen, a sister of the
Elimine Church in Bern.@0003
I am pleased to make your
acquaintance.@0003
@0009Dear God...@0003
@000CUh...Father Saul?@0003
@0009I must be blessed to be able to
meet such a beautiful lady.@0003
And you are a follower of the
Elimine Church!@0003
This must surely be fate.@0003
Please, let us meet this evening
and we shall discuss the love of@0003
God in great depth.@0003
@000CYes, I would love to.
Shall we set up a time now?@0003
Any time would work for me...@0003
@0009@0017@0016......@0016
Are you serious?@0003
@000C@0017You are going to talk about
God's love, right?@0003
Why would I even think of
refusing?@0003
@0009@0017But...If you accept so easily,
there's no...satisfaction.@0003
@000CSatisfaction?@0003
@0009@0017Oh!@0003
@0017Please, never mind.
But Ellen, are you sure?@0003
I am actually rather loose around
women and I may do something@0003
undesirable to you...@0003
@000C@0017No, that will not happen.
You are a priest.@0003
You will surely not do
something like that.@0003
@0009@0016...Er...@0016
I'm sorry.@0003
Perhaps some other day.@0003
@000COh...
I was looking forward to it..@0003
[03C4]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@010F@0009Why, hello, Ellen.@0003
@000CGood day, Father Saul.
It is good to see you safe.@0003
@0009@0017...You are so tense,
so uptight!@0003
No, that will not do.
You must relax your muscles.@0003
@000C...Do you think so?@0003
@0009@0017Yes.@0003NL
[03C5]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@010F@000C@0017Father Saul...
Why did you not come that night?@0003
Everyone was looking forward very
much to your preaching..@0003
@0009@0017Oh, um...
My throat wasn't doing well that day.@0003
We can do that some other time...@0003
@000C@0017Yes.@0003
Father Saul, you really are a
noble person.@0003
@0009@0017...Excuse me?
Noble?@0003
@000C@0017Yes.@0003
Usually you appear to be a impious,
improper womanizer.@0003
Hardly someone I would call a priest.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016But I finally realized that there
was a complicated reason to that.@0003
You were putting on a show to show
how free the Elimine Church is.@0003
@0009@0017Ah...@0003
I, uh...see.@0003
@000C@0017Acting like that would naturally
cause misunderstandings..@0003
Everyone thinks you're just a lazy
man chasing after women...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016But you purposely walk that path for
the benefit of the Church.@0003
I surely could not do the same.
I sincerely respect you, Father Saul.@0003
@0009@0017Er...@0003
Well anyways, remember to relax
once in awhile, okay?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, Father Saul.@0003
[03C6]
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@010F@000CLady Miledy,
are you not hurt?@0003
@0009No, Ellen, I'm fine.@0003
@000COh, if you're going up front, then
please take these vulneraries...@0003
@0009Ellen, what's the matter?@0003
@000C@0017What?@0003
@0009@0017You seem to be more...
helpful than usual.@0003
@000C@0017N-No!
By no means!@0003
@0009If you have something to say,
then I'm willing to listen.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016@0017Well, I guess I can't force you...@0003
But since we are both serving
Princess Guinevere, I would@0003
appreciate it if you told me.@0003
@000C@0017I-I'm sorry...@0003
@0009Ah well, I suppose I'll
wait until you're ready.@0003@0011
@000CI'm sorry...
Lady Miledy...@0003
[03C7]
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@010F@000C@0017Lady Miledy!
About the other day...@0003
@0009The other day?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
You said that I was being more
helpful than usual...@0003
@0009Oh, that.@0003
Are you ready to tell me
@0017what's on your mind?@0003
@000C@0017Yes.
Uh...@0003
It's just that...
I wanted to apologize.@0003
@0009@0017Apologize?
For what?@0003
@000C@0017When Princess Guinevere and I
decided to go meet the Lycian@0003
Alliance army, I didn't consult
you at all.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I just wanted to apologize
about that...@0003
I knew you had the deepest
loyalty for Princess Guinevere,@0003
and still...@0003
@0009@0017You just followed Princess Guinevere's
orders, like we are supposed to.@0003
You have nothing to feel bad about.@0003
@000C@0017But...@0003
@0009@0017Ellen, you mustn't always mull over
the past like that if you want to@0003
move forward.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
[03C8]
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@010F@0009Ellen, you look a lot
better now.@0003
@000CYes, I feel like I relieved myself
of a huge load after you were kind@0003
enough to listen to me.@0003
@0009Good.@0003
@000C@0017But I'm no good, am I...@0003
I am the cleric, I'm the one who
is supposed to listen to you and@0003
relieve your stress..@0003
@0009Ellen, didn't I tell you before
that you mustn't mull over@0003
things like that?@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009I'm actually grateful that you
didn't tell me when you went@0003
off with the Princess.@0003
@000CThankful...?@0003
@0009@0017Of course.@0003
You protected Princess Guinevere
while I was gone.@0003
@000C@0017Lady Miledy...@0003
@0009@0017Let's continue to work together to
help Princess Guinevere in the future.@0003
So no more feeling down over trivial
matters, all right?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
[03C9]
@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@012A@000C@0017Ellen!@0003
@0009Sir Zeiss!?@0003
@000C@0017I knew I saw you in
this army.@0003
@0009Yes, I will always be at
Princess Guinevere's side...@0003
Sir Zeiss, did you join to
help Lady Miledy?@0003
@000COf course that's part of it, but
the main reason I joined is to@0003
see the heart that Princess
Guinevere has for Bern.@0003
@0009?@0003
So you will be helping us
as well?@0003
@000C@0017Well, not entirely, but...
@0017Yeah, I guess you're right.@0003
@0009Thank you!
You will be of great assistance.@0003
@000CYeah, well,
I suppose.@0003
@0009I'm sorry,
I must be off...@0003
@000CAll right, see you.@0003
[03CA]
@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@012A@0009@0017Sir Zeiss!@0003
@000CEllen, what's the matter?@0003
@0009There was a man over there with
an extremely menacing face...@0003
@000CWhat!?@0003
Where!?
Oh, him?@0003
@0017...Ellen, that person is in
our army.@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
Oh... I...
I was so rude!@0003
@000C@0017Did you scream or something?@0003
@0009@0016Yes.@0016@0003
@000CYou're still scared of men?
Well, I guess I can't blame you.@0003
It was years before you would
speak to me normally like this!@0003
@0009@0017I'm sorry...@0003
@000C@0017No, it's all right.
It's more like you.@0003
But could you stop
calling me sir?@0003
@0009@0017Ah...I...@0003
@000C@0017Okay, okay,
don't stress over it...Well then, see you.@0003
Just tell me if
something happens.@0003@0011
@0009@0016......@0003
[03CB]
@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@012A@000CEllen!@0003
@0009@0017Sir...Zeiss.@0003
@000C@0017Here.@0003
@0009@0017These flowers...@0003
@000C@0017They're the same as the ones you
were growing back in Bern, right?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Ellen?
What's wrong?@0003
Wait, are these the wrong flowers?@0003
@0009@0016...Why...?@0003
@000C@0016@0017Huh?@0003
@0009Why are you always...
so good to me...?@0003
@000C@0017Eh?
Ah, er, well...@0003
Well, we come from the same town,
and uh...I don't know, it's just@0003
that I can't...leave you alone,@0003
@0017you know?@0003
I want to stay by your side and@0005
protect you...@0003
Is that not good?@0003
@0009@0017No, I'm very glad...@0003
@0017But I must stay at
Princess Guinevere's side...@0003
@000CI know.@0003
I'm also a knight of Bern, so
I'll protect the princess with@0003
@0017with all my strength.@0003
So let's defend the Princess,
and someday we can return to@0003
Bern together!@0009Yes@0003
Thank you Zeiss...
Thank you...@0003
[03CC]
@000C@0010@010F@0009@0010@0121@0009Sister!@0003
I got the medicine and sheets
that you asked for.@0003
@000CThank you, could you leave
them there please?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
Well then, I have to get going.@0003
@000CWait!@0003
@0009?@0003
Yes?@0003
@000CAre you an assistant to the
transporter?@0003
@0009No, I'm fighting as well.@0003
@000C@0017What?@0003
A child like you...
in battle?@0003
@0009@0017I may be still a kid, but
I'm pretty handy with my magic,@0003
you know!@0003
@000C@0017No, I wasn't doubting your ability...@0003
It's just that... children shouldn't
be on the battlefield.@0003
@0009@0017I'm only two years younger than
Master Roy, though.@0003
@000C@0017Master Roy... well, he has no choice.@0003
But that's not the case for you.@0003
@0009@0017No, I'm no different.
I have a reason to fight, too.@0003
@000C@0017But...!@0003
@0009@0017Thanks for being concerned about me.
But I'll be fine.@0003
Oh, I have to go!
I'm in the middle of an errand.@0003
See you later, sister!@0003@0011
@000C@0017......@0003
[03CD]
@000C@0010@010F@0009@0010@0121@000C@0017Do you have a moment?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, the sister from the other
day!@0003
@000C@0017I am Ellen.@0003
@0009@0017I am Lou.@0003
@000C@0017You're really fighting in the
battlefield...@0003
Are you all right?
Are you injured?@0003
@0009@0017I'm fine.@0003
I'm small, but I'm pretty fast.@0003
@000C@0017Lou...@0003
I'm still worried about sending such
a small child into battle...@0003
@0009Do I look so small?@0003
Well, if I look at it, it's just
as dangerous to send a lady like@0003
you into the battlefield.@0003
@000CThat... may be true, but...@0003
@0009@0017That's right!@0003
So if you're ever in danger,
I'll protect you.@0003
You can count on me!@0003
@000CAll right, Lou.@0003
@0017Please don't do anything rash.@0003
[03CE]
@000C@0010@010F@000E@0010@0121@0080@000B@0017Miss Ellen!@0003
@000C@0017Lou?
What's wrong?@0003
@0009@0017I-I thought I saw an enemy near
you, so...@0003
Phew...@0003@0006
@0017But I guess I was wrong.
Thank goodness.@0003
@000CYou were looking out for me?
Thank you.@0003
@0009Of course!@0003
I said I would protect you.@0003
@000CYou have such a kind heart...@0003
I am sure God would look favorably
on you.@0003
@0009... When you smile like that,
you look like a saint!@0003
@000C@0017A saint?
Me?@0003
@0009@0017Yes.@0003
I was always worried because you
always seem to look a little sad.@0003
Well, I suppose it can't be helped
in a time like this...@0003
But I feel so much better when
you smile like that!@0003
@000CLou, I feel better when I see you
smile as well.@0003
[03CF]
emlpb@0010@E482srWhat?@0003
@0009That must be because you're looking
straight ahead at your dream of@0003
mastering the sword.@0003
I will pray that your dream will
come true one day.@0003
@000C@0017Yes!
Thank you!@0003
[03D0]
y it?@0003
@0017...No, that doesn't sound right
at all.@0003
Hmm... this is tough.@0003
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0016......@0003
@000C@0016@0017Oh, I know!@0003
I can bring him some food that he
likes...@0003
Wait, I don't know what kind of
food he likes...@0003
@0017I like fruit, but what about him?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0011
@000C@0016Hmm...well...
What can I do? ...@0003
[03D1]

 tlr me talking to myself?@0003
@0009It was difficult not to listen with
such a loud voice.@0003
@000CUm...er...@0003
@0009If you want to talk to me,
then don't hesitate.@0003
@000C@0017It's all right!?@0003
@0009Of course...
We're in the same army.@0003
@000CYes!@0003
[03D2]

lbertrouble
when you're surrounded.@0003
@0009You didn't have to do that.@0003
@000CWell, I saw it.
It was an automatic reaction.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CWell, I'll be going now.@0003
Make sure you don't start
shooting at me again!@0003
@0009I won't make that mistake.@0003
@000C@0017You sure did the other day!@0003
...Well, we're in heated action, so it
can't be helped if you occasionally@0003
make a mistake.@0003
@0009@0017I'm not stupid enough to point my
bow at an ally.@0003
...There's no way I would shoot you.@0003
@000C...Yeah, you're right!@0003
@0009I'll be right behind you.
Leave the enemies you missed to me.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I will!@0003
[03D3]
you missed to me.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I will!@0003
[03D4]
pe.@0003
But that was a decoy...@0003
The enemies main forces were stationed
right where everyone fled to...@0003
@0009Good.
You did your best.@0003
I'm sure you can't forget it so easily,
but you must at least get over it.@0003
@000CYes...I'll try.@0003
[03D5]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@012E@0009Hm...
So this is a wyvern.@0003
@000C@0017You are...@0003
Bishop Yodel of the
Elimine Church.@0003
@0009@0017Yes, pleased to meet you,
Miss Miledy.@0003
She is so passive...@0003
I would have imagined wyverns
to be more ferocious creatures.@0003
@000C@0017Trifinne will spread her wings and
bare her fangs at my commands.@0003
However, that is due to the
training by the Bern Army.@0003
...Perhaps she wishes not to
be fighting at all.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
@000CTrifinne and I trained together ever
since we were still little.@0003
We trained hard to become a proud
Dragon knight in the service of@0003
our country.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I...@0003
I don't regret leaving Bern
with Princess Guinevere.@0003
of Bern...@0003
It is painful to fight against
my former allies.@0003
@0009...Indeed.@0003
@000C@0017But I'm trying hard to
get used to it.@0003
For Princess Guinevere...
and for my country.@0003
[03D6]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@012E@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Is something wrong,
Miss Miledy?@0003
@000C@0017No...@0003
It's just that my house is
in this area.@0003
@0009Ah...@0003
So you have family there?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, my grandfather and my parents.@0003
Both my father and his father would
tell us stories of how they defeated@0003
legions of enemies in their time.@0003
They were so elated when my brother
and I were knighted as Dragon@0003
Knights as well...@0003
I wonder what they're doing now...?@0003
@0009...Miss Miledy...@0003
Your path has been a difficult
one indeed.@0003
Forgive me, I can't do anything
for you.@0003
@000C@0017No...@0003
I appreciate you listening to
me like this.@0003
Perhaps...@0003
I was looking for someone
to talk to.@0003
If I will suffice, I shall be more
than happy to hear your concerns.@0003
Don't forget, Miss Miledy...
You are not alone.@0003
@000CThank you,
Bishop Yodel...@0003
[03D7]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@012E@000CBishop Yodel, I must thank you
For helping me so I wouldn't@0003
feel so alienated in the army...@0003
@0009No...
It is my pleasure.@0003
Trifinne...your master is a very
kind-hearted person.@0003
@000C@0017I've put her through a lot of
stress, too.@0003
I'm sure she never wanted to
turn her back on Bern...@0003
I've dragged her along with my
selfish motives...@0003
@0009@0017Do you really think so?@0003
@000C...?@0003
@0009I understand that Bern's training
implements absolute loyalty in its@0003
troops.@0003
Both in their knights, and their
mounts.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
@0009If that is the case, then why is
Trifinne following your orders@0003
and fighting against Bern?@0003
@000CWell...@0003
@0009I am sure that there were other
Dragon Knights and even Bern's@0003
in the enemy ranks.@0003
If this wyvern is simply a
creature that would follow the@0003
army's commands, she would not
be here with you now.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009@0017Do you understand?@0003
This wyvern thought on her own
and made up her own mind.@0003
She chose to be with you.@0003
Just as you chose to be with
Princess Guinevere.@0003
@000C@0017...She made up her own mind...@0003
@0009@0017You are a blessed person,
Miss Miledy.@0003
You always have close friends
at your side.@0003
You don't need me to do
anything special.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
Thank you...@0003
[03D8]
@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@0121@000CChad!
There you are.@0003
@0009?
Something smells good...@0003
@000CHere you go.
That's your share.@0003
@0009Hey,
baked tarts!@0003
Where'd you get these?@0003
@000CThe meal delivery man
gave me some extra ones.@0003
@0009...Man, they look good...
I can really have them?@0003
@000COf course.@0003
@0009Yes!
...Man, these are good.@0003
@000CHaha!@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
@000C@0017Oh, sorry.@0003
It's just that you always look
really happy when you're eating.@0003
@0009I do?@0003
@000CYeah.@0003
I think that's one of the
best things about you.@0003
@0009@0017W-What the...@0003
I'm not gonna give you anything
even if you praise me.@0003
I-I'll be going now.
Thanks for the food!@0003@0011
@000C@0017Haha, that's nothing to be
embarrassed about.@0003
[03D9]
@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@0121@0009@0017Lugh!
Here.@0003
@000C@0017What?@0003
Oh, a new pair of shoes?
Where did you get this?@0003
@0009@0017I didn't steal it, all right?@0003
The other day I came across an
old lady who lost her key, so@0003
I helped her out.@0003
She gave me the shoes.@0003
@000C@0017Then why don't you wear them?
She gave them to you, not me.@0003
@0009@0017No, it's all right.@0003
My shoes aren't as beat up as
yours, and besides, they're a@0003
little small for me, anyway.@0003
@000C@0017But we're about the same height.@0003
If they're small for you, they
would be small on me, too.@0003
@0009@0017J-Just take them!@0003
I'm older, so my feet are a
little bigger than yours!@0003
@000C@0017What?
That's not right!@0003
@0009@0017Of course it is!
End of story, okay?@0003
@0017You better wear those shoes,
got it?@0003
See you.@0003@0011
@000CChad!
...Thanks.@0003
[03DA]
@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@0121@000C@0017Chad!@0003
What's wrong?
Is something on your mind?@0003
@0009Lugh...@0003
No, I was just thinking that it's
been a long time since we joined@0003
this army.@0003
I wonder how the little ones are
doing...@0003
@000CYeah, I wonder.
@0017I hope they're being good
listening to the Elimine@0003
priests...@0003
@0009@0017I wonder if they're waiting for
us to return...@0003
@000C...Sure they are.
We're family, right?@0003
@0009You know...
I'm glad that you came with me.@0003
@000COh?@0003
Then does that mean you think
I'm strong enough?@0003
@0009Well...@0003
I already knew that you were
strong...@0003
@000C@0017Then what?@0003
@0009@0017How can I say this...@0003
You have a twin brother,
Ray, right?@0003
So I kinda felt that even
if we three were together,@0003
I would be sort of left out.@0003
@000CWhat's that supposed to mean!@0003
I always thought of you as
family, just as much as Ray!@0003
@0009Yeah, I know!
Now I know better.@0003
I was just creating a wall around
myself and was trapped inside.@0003
But now I think of you as my
real family.@0003
@000C@0017...Okay, I'll forgive you.@0003
You're my older brother,
even if you're a...@0003
little...childish.@0003
@0009@0017What!
Lugh, you!@0003
@000C@0017Hahahaha...@0003
[03DB]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0111@000C@0017Hey!
Ray!@0003
@0009...Chad.@0003
Who said you could come talk
to me?@0003
@000CDammit, I wouldn't if
I didn't need to.@0003
@0009What do you want?@0003
@000CRoy...@0003
I mean Master Roy wants to
see us.@0003
@0009Like I care.@0003
@000CY-You idiot!@0003
Don't say such things in a
loud voice!@0003
That Merlinus guy'll be
after us again!@0003
@0009@0017What, are you afraid
of that old geezer?@0003
@000C@0017I sure am.@0003
He and Master Roy are both
nobles.@0003
@0009@0017Haha, so little Chad'll
go bowing down to power?@0003
@000C@0017...Laugh while you can.
But let me say this.@0003
If we go against nobility,
we can't complain no matter@0003
what happens to us.@0003
Master Roy doesn't seem like
that kind of person, but I@0003
don't know about the others.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I don't want to watch someone I know
get beat up right in front of me.@0003
You've got quite a mouth, but
if you don't want to get killed,@0003
use it somewhere else.@0003
...I'm going.
You better come, too.@0003@0011
@0009@0016......@0003
[03DC]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0111@0009@0017...Hey.@0003
@000C...What?@0003
@0009You're still stealing
and stuff, huh.@0003
@000C!@0003
I've got no choice, all right?
I can't use magic like you.@0003
All I can do for this army is pick
locks and go gather information...@0003
@0009Well, it's pretty good
if you can do that.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009You know the other day when we
had to go see that Roy person...@0003
He said that he appreciated the
work of us, who are close to his age.@0003
But you were constantly bowing down
and saying that you never did@0003
anything important.@0003
@000CYeah?@0003
@0009You're doing something only you
can do.@0003
Then why don't you be proud of
it?@0003
You look like an idiot, always
putting yourself down like that.@0003
@000C...Uh, are you trying
to cheer me up?@0003
@0009D-Don't be ridiculous!@0003
There would be no reason in hell that
I would be trying to cheer you up!@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I thought so.@0003
Good, you had me scared for
a sec there.@0003
@0009@0017...Dammit!
I'm going!@0003
@000CHey!
What's your problem?@0003
[03DD]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0111@000C@0017Hey!@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000C@0017Don't ignore me.
I have to talk to you.@0003
@0009@0017About what?@0003
@000CWhen this war is over,
what are you going to do?@0003
@0009...What about you?@0003
@000CI'll go pick up the little
ones first.@0003
Then I'll try and get some money
to rebuild the orphanage.@0003
@0009Then I'll go with you.@0003
@0017I can help out until the
little kids settle down.@0003
@000C...I thought so.@0003
@0009?@0003
@000CYou're actually a good guy
deep down inside.@0003
@0009@0017!!@0003
@000C@0017Lugh always used to say that you
were kind.@0003
I used to think that he was trying
to defend you as his brother, but@0003
I guess not.@0003
He's your brother all right, and he
knows how you really are.@0003
@0009@0017...You're just as naive
as Lugh!@0003
Say what you want!
I'm going!@0003@0011
@000C@0017Ha, there's no need to
get embarrassed...@0003
Hey! Wait!
Don't walk off for real!@0003
[03DE]
@000E@0010@012C@000C@0010@0111@000E@0080@000BHey.@0003
@000C@0017Whoa!
Who are you?@0003
@0009@0017You've got talent.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, so who are you?@0003
@0009@0017...You don't know me?
I'm Cath, a master thief!@0003
@000C@0017...Who?@0003
@0009...Ignorant...
I'm your elder.@0003
@0017You should respect me,
you know.@0003
@000C@0017No.@0003
I brushed my stealing skills on my
own, and I will continue to do so@0003
from now on.@0003
@0009@0017No, no, you're not going to
get any further on your own.@0003
Oh well, I guess you can learn
under my training.@0003
@000C@0017Wait,
why would I...@0003
@0009@0017So, you're now my Servant You'll work for me from now on.@0003
@000C@0017Why would I!?@0003
@0009@0017You'd better watch
your mouth.@0003
Isn't this your bag?@0003
@000C@0017H-Hey!@0003
When did you...@0003
Give it back!@0003
[03DF]
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0111@000C@0017Hey!@0003
@0009@0017Oh, it's you.@0003
@000C@0017Give me back my bag!
Now!@0003
@0009Whoa...@0003
Calm down.
Here.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016@0017What are those scribbles?
Who is that?@0003
@000C@0017Father...@0003
@0009@0017Father...?@0003
...You're an orphan.@0003
@000C@0017...I wasn't good in my studies,
but when I drew pictures, Father@0003
praised me.@0003
He said I had clever fingers, and
that I could be an artist someday...@0003
@0009@0016......@0016
I see...@0003@0002
@0016......
......@0003
@0016Ah!@0003
I don't like situations like this.
I want to live more optimistically.@0003
You should do the same, @000CWhat do you mean, 
@0009@0017You.
You're my Servant @000C@0017I never agreed to that!@0003

[03E0]
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0111@0009Hey, Servant How have you been doing?@0003
@000C@0017...Fine.@0003
@0009@0017I've been watching you.
You seem to have been improving.@0003
Well of course, you're not as
good as I am, though.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, whatever.@0003
I never became your servant,
all right.@0003
@0009Hey, wait.@0003
If not my servant, how about
@0017my partner?@0003
@000C@0017...Partner?@0003
@0009@0017Right.
We can be partners.@0003
The famous pair of thieves,
out to save the poor!@0003@0002
What do you say?@0003
@000C@0017Pair...@0003
...That in itself doesn't sound
too appealing.@0003@0011
@0009What?
Wait a minute!@0003
It's the master thief giving you
this offer!@0003
I said wait!@0003
[03E1]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0111@000C@0017Hey, you!
Are you Hugh?@0003
@0009Eh?
What do you want, kid?@0003
@000C...Is it true that you're
a moneylender?@0003
@0009And if it were?@0003
@000CI want to borrow 3000G
right now.@0003
@0009@0017Well, I'm sorry, kid.@0003
I only lend money to grown-ups
or the hottest chicks.@0003
@000C@0017...Oh.@0003
All right then, I'll ask
someone else.@0003
@0009@0017Hey, hey, hey,
wait just a minute.@0003
You're an impatient kid,
aren't you?@0003
You can't just give up so
easily like that.@0003
@000C@0017But you only lend money to
adults or cute girls, right?@0003
@0009@0017Well, if you really insist,
I can make an exception.@0003
But the interest will be
twice the normal rate.@0003
@000C@0017I thought it would be something
like that.@0003
...But fine.
Let me borrow the money.
I'll give it back to you on the@0003
next payday.@0003
@0009@0017One, two, three.
Here you go, 3000G.@0003
@000C@0017Thanks.
See you later.@0003@0011
@0009@0017Remember, it's 4000 including the
interest!@0003
@0017...How could I turn him down
after he looks at me like that?@0003
This is why I don't like kids...@0003
[03E2]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0111@000C@0017Yo!
Here's the money I owe you.@0003
@0009@0017One, two, three, four.
Yup, that's 4000.@0003
I haven't seen you around lately
so I thought you ran off with it.@0003
@000C@0017I keep my promises.
That's natural as a human being.@0003
@0009@0017Well you know, it's not so natural
for some people.@0003
Kids sure are honest.
You sure you chose the right job?@0003
@000C@0017Stop calling me kid.
My name is Chad.@0003
@0009@0017All right.@0003
Well then, Chad, why'd you
become a thief?@0003
@000C@0017...I have to steal to live.
I'm an orphan.@0003
@0009You always lived your life alone?@0003
@000CNo, I lived in a small orphanage near
the border between Lycia and Bern.@0003
I grew up with other orphans.@0003
We were doing pretty well, Father
and the other kids and me...@0003
...If this war didn't break out,
I'd still be there.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Father was a nice person, but he was
only able to maintain the orphanage@0003
through the help of the villagers.@0003
And then the war broke out, we
started running out of food and@0003
clothing.@0003
I was the oldest of the orphans,
but I couldn't find any work.@0003
So the only way to get food was to
steal.@0003
@0009@0017So you sent the 3000G to the
orphanage...@0003
@000C@0017No.@0003
...The orphanage isn't there anymore.@0003
@0009!?@0003
@000CFather was killed by Bern's troops
and the place was burned down...@0003
@0009W-What about the children?
Were they killed?@0003
@000CThanks to Father, we all survived.@0003
The little kids are waiting for me
under the protection of the Elimine@0003
Church.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I used the 3000G to buy a strong
sword.@0003
I'm going to use it to help end
this war quickly and go pick up@0003
the little ones!@0003
@0009So the kids are the family that
you want to protect.@0003
@000CRight.
I have nothing else.@0003
You got a problem with that?@0003
@0009@0017No...
Sorry I made fun of you.@0003
You're already grown up, Chad.@0003
You're certainly more of an
adult than I am.@0003
[03E3]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0111@0009Hey!
Chad!@0003
Have you been doing well?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I suppose.
But not as well as you.@0003
@0009@0017Man, are you always like that?@0003
Can't you say something like,@0003
@0017'Hey, Hugh!
What's up?'@0003
or something with a bright
smile on your face?@0003
@000C...Sick.@0003
@0009Sick?
Aw, come on!@0003
You know, you got me all worked
up after you told me that story.@0003
I really want to help out!@0003
@000C...Mister, are you really a mage?@0003
You sure you're not some kind of
jester or something?@0003
@0009M-Mister!?@0003
Wait a minute, you're calling this
superbly handsome young man, a mister!?@0003
@000CYou're a mister from my view.@0003
@0009Ugh!@0003
You stabbed me in my sensitive
spot just now!@0003
...Not Mister, Mister won't do!@0003
You can call me anything, but
not Mister!@0003
I have a really sensitive soul,
soul, you know!@0003
@000C@0017... Hahahahahahahahaha!@0003
Haha...hee...my...my stomach...!
Hahaha...!@0003
@0009!!@0003
@000COh man, that was funny.
You're pretty weird, aren't you?@0003
Fine, I'll call you Hugh.
That's okay, right?@0003
Since you say you're not a Mister.@0003
@0009So you can laugh!@0003
@000C@0017Huh?@0003
@0009You know, you've always got that
glare in your eye.@0003
Your eyebrows are always bunched
up like this, you know?@0003
And you've got a foul mouth,
you've got an attitude, and you@0003
don't even smile.@0003
@000CWhat are you saying all of
a sudden?@0003
@0009I've seen so many kids who've lost
the ability to smile in this war.@0003
Grown-ups have a lot of issues, but
come on, kids have to be laughing.@0003
Although it seems like the idiots
starting wars don't realize that.@0003
@000C@0016...@0003
@0009@0016@0017Well anyway, if there are kids
who can still laugh, I suppose@0003
there's still hope for this world.@0003
I know it's been tough for you,
but make sure to laugh once in a@0003
while, okay?@0003
@000C@0017H-Hey!
Don't mess up my hair!@0003
@0009@0017Hahahaha, sorry!
Well then, see you later.@0003
Don't mess up, you got that?@0003
@0011
@000C...Maybe there is still hope for
this world with adults like you...@0003
[03E4]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0113@000CUncle!@0003
@0009@0017Ah, Fir.@0003
Please let me stay with you and
learn from the mastery of your@0003
sword!@0003
@0009@0017Suit yourself.@0003
@000C@0017Thank you!
...But...@0003
@0017It doesn't feel right that you
are staying here partnering@0003
with me.@0003
I'm still a novice, and you're
the strongest member of our army!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016They don't know how
powerful you are!@0003
Once they see the true strength
of the Sword Saint, then they'll...@0003
@0009Fir.@0003
@000CY-Yes?@0003
@0009Your heart is wandering.@0003
@000CI...
I respect you so much, so...@0003
@0009It is pointless to marvel
over one's power.@0003
That is not the kind of
strength I seek.@0003
@000C...Yes, Uncle.@0003
[03E5]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0113@000C@0017Uncle...@0003
@0009@0017What is it,
Fir?@0003
@000C@0017Please, teach me
the way of the sword!@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CI want to know how
you gained your power.@0003
I want to master the sword
like you did.@0003
@0009@0017The way of the sword...@0003
@000CYes!@0003
@0009Is not something that can
be taught, Fir.@0003
@000C@0017What...?@0003
@0009@0017A sword is simply a sword.
It is a weapon used to kill people.@0003
@000C@0017That...@0003
That's not true!@0003
@0009@0017There's no strength in this
piece of metal.@0003
I have lived by the sword ever
since I was born, but my blade@0003
never gained any power.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016True strength is not the
power of a weapon.@0003
It is something that cannot
cannot be seen.@0003
We all have it within us.
Even you, Fir.@0003
@000C@0017M-Me...?@0003
[03E6]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0113
@000C@0017Please tell me,
Uncle!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016What is true strength...?
What is the way...?@0003
What...@0003
What must I do?@0003
@0009@0017...Fir.@0003
You were always looking at your
Mother's back and following after her.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016And you've come to me for advice
because you lost sight of your mother.@0003
@000C@0017...Yes.@0003
@0009@0017But, Fir.@0003
You are not your mother,
nor are you me.@0003
The path which you seek
does not lie behind us.@0003
It lies in front of you.@0003
It is you who must cut open
that path for yourself.@0003
@000C@0017In front...of me?@0003
@0009@0017That isn't something that can
be taught.
It is something which you must
discover on your own.@0003
@000C@0017...Yes.@0003
Thank you, Uncle!@0003
[03E7]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0120@000C@0017I...
I'm terribly sorry about my wife.@0003
If I could take her place, I
would do so in an instant.@0003
@0009@0017Well, I can't exactly say that
my sister's health was in good@0003
condition.@0003
I'm glad she lived as long as
she did.@0003
@000C@0017I'm sorry...@0003
@0009@0017One thing I am worried about
is Fir.@0003
She lost her mother at such
a young age...@0003
@000C@0017Yes...
Maybe...@0003
Maybe the reason she left home
to train herself was that she@0003
wanted to get her mind off of
her mother's death.@0003
@0009Training?@0003
So Fir was traveling around
the continent?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
She said she wanted to become
a great swordmaster like her@0003
mother.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
[03E8]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0120@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Bartre...
What's the matter?@0003
@000C@0017Ah, Karel.@0003
...I was just thinking about
my wife.@0003
@0009About my sister?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
I first met her when I was
traveling around the world,@0003
training myself.@0003
And then...
I met her at the arena.@0003
Her sword...it was almost
invisible.@0003
...I suffered defeat for
the first time in my life.@0003
@0009...I understand.@0003
In our family, the sword is everything.@0003
We are brought up by the sword, and it
is all we know.@0003
The sword was so central to our lives...
even to the point that it blinded us@0003
from our own human nature.@0003
@000CEach time I lost, I would challenge
her to a rematch.@0003
And then, the third time we fought,
I was able to evade her first strike.@0003
I was immediately knocked out by her
second strike, though...@0003
When I woke up...there she was.@0003
It was the first time I saw her
smile.@0003
After that, we traveled together,
training ourselves alongside@0003@0002
each other.@0003
Although...
I was never able to defeat her.@0003
@0009@0017You wouldn't see my sister
smile very often...@0003
She must have been that
fond of you.@0003
@000C@0017Do you think so...?@0003
[03E9]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0120@000C@0017...After she fell sick, my wife
started telling me about her family@0003
for the first time.@0003
She talked about her heritage, about
you, and...about herself.@0003
@0009@0017I'm sure my sister was happy to be
with you when she left this world.@0003
@000C@0017Around that time was when we
first met each other as well...@0003
You resembled my wife when we
first met.@0003
You were inhumanly strong...
yet dangerous, and forbidding.@0003
@0009...Yes.@0003
That time, I left you two without
saying a word.@0003
You must have thought what a
@0017terrible brother I was.@0003
@000C@0017No, not at all.NL
[03EA]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0114@000C@0016
!@0003
@0009@0016You noticed me at this distance?
Impressive.@0003
@000C@0017...Karel, the Sword Saint.@0003
@0009Well, what an honor.
You know me?@0003
@000C...Everyone who uses the sword
knows your name.@0003
@0009@0017Yes, well, I traveled all around
when I was young.@0003
@000C@0017...Why are you in this army?@0003
@0009@0017My family is here, so I joined
as well.@0003I'm hoping that even my rusty
skills can be of use.@0003
@000C@0017Rusty?
Even you joke around sometimes?@0003
@0009@0017No, I am serious.@0003
I would probably lose out to
you young ones.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0011@0007
@0009...Interesting.@0003
[03EB]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0114@0009You, please wait a moment.@0003
@000C@0017...What do you want?@0003
@0009@0017I am looking for someone to
spar with.@0003
Would you care to?@0003
@000C@0017...No.@0003
@0009@0017Why?@0003
Am I not a worthy opponent
for you?@0003
@000C@0017Your sword isn't used to kill...@0003
It doesn't agree with the path
I pursue.@0003
@0009@0017Perhaps you think so now, but we
follow the way of the sword...@0003
All paths of the sword lead to
the same place.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
[03EC]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0114@0009...Do you need something,
Rutger?@0003
@000C@0017I want to ask you something.@0003
@0009@0017Yes?@0003
@000C@0017I sense no hate in your sword...@0003
You seem to blend with the air
when you attack.@0003
Even the heaviest, strongest
blades can't cut through air...@0003
Your sword would beat them all.
I want to become stronger.@0003
If all paths of the sword lead
to one place, then would I be@0003
able to blend with the air
as you do?@0003
@0009@0017...You're from Sacae,
aren't you?@0003
@000C@0017...Yes.@0003
@0009@0017I was born in Sacae as well.@0003
I grew up under the protection of
of our Father the Sky, and our@0003
Mother the Earth.@0003
They are all that are in my
sword.@0003
@000C@0017I'm not a pure Sacaean...@0003
I wouldn't be able to sense
them like you can...@0003
@0009@0017Was that true when you
were young?@0003
@000C!!@0003
@0009You were able to hear the sky
and earth once.@0003
Although it seems that your
hate is covering your ears.@0003
@000C@0017...Do you think I will be able to
hear them when this war ends?@0003
@0009@0017Of course you will.@0003
The breeze that runs through
the plains...@0003
It never forgets those that
it loves.@0003
[03ED]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@012A@000C@0017You're the Sword Saint...?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016@0017...They gave me that name against
my will.@0003
Just call me Karel.@0003
@000C@0017Master Karel, I am a Dragon
Knight of Bern.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016...You're not going to say
anything?@0003
My father said you fought against
Bern in the past.@0003
He saw you in a rain of blood,
slicing all those who crossed@0003
through your path...@0003
@0009@0017...I am through with this world.@0003
Bern, Etruria...@0003
They are meaningless words to
me now.@0003
I am only here for my family.@0003
@000C@0017...I see.@0003
If only I could think like that...
But I can't...@0003
Not even after Bern has fallen...@0003
[03EE]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@012A@000C@0017Before coming here...
I fought against my older brother.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016He's not my real brother...
His name was Gale.@0003
He was a Dragon Knight with equal
power to the Three Dragon Lords.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I always looked up to him.
My sister was also very fond of him...@0003
...I never would have thought the
three of us would end up as enemies.@0003
I never thought that we would have
to fight Gale...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I'm sorry...@0003
Have I bored you?@0003
@0009@0017No, not at all.@0003
A life story can never
be boring.@0003
[03EF]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@012A
@0009Zeiss.@0003
@000C@0017Yes?@0003
@0009@0017Why...@0003
Why did you tell me that
story?@0003
@000C@0016...I thought that you would@0003
@0016@0017be able to guide me...
Perhaps you would be able to help@0003
me get rid of my hesitation...@0003
@0009@0017...Unfortunately, I don't have any
words of guidance for you.@0003
But...
I can say this.@0003
It is you who must carve@0002
@0009your own path.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Zeiss...@0003
I think you already
have an answer.@0003
@000C@0017...Maybe.
Perhaps...@0003
I just wanted someone to tell
me that the path I chose wasn't@0003
a mistake.@0003
@0009@0017Then...@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I understand now.@0003
I chose to turn against my country...
And I won't regret that decision.@0003
[03F0]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0130@000C@0017...I've never heard of this
area before.@0003
I never knew there was a
place like this in Bern.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016@0017This is a land that people have
long forgotten.@0003
The years go by, but time just
seems to linger...@0003
It is that kind of place.@0003
@000C@0017Did you always live here?@0003
@0009@0017No.@0003
Before I settled here, I used
to travel around the world,@0003
living by the sword.@0003
@000C@0017Then...
Have you been to Ilia?@0003
@0009@0017...Once, in the past.@0003
[03F1]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0130@000CThe Sword Saint...@0003
Have you heard of this
legendary figure?@0003
@0009...No.@0003
@000CMy mother used to tell me stories
about him.@0003
When I was still very young, a
large group of bandits attackedNL
[03F2]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0130@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Master Karel...@0003
@0009@0017I suppose I should tell you the
truth.@0003
Keeping silent to cover up one's
shame would be stepping off the@0003
path of the sword.@0003
@000CShame?
You saved my village...@0003
@0009No.@0003
I never thought about saving the
Village.@0003
I just wanted to kill.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I was like a demon back then...
possessed by the sword.@0003
I was aimlessly wandering around
looking for people to satisfy my@0003
lust for blood.@0003
As long as I could cut, as long
as I could kill, it didn't@0003
matter who it was.@0003
...Even if it were an infant in a
village I happened to stop by at.@0003
@000C!@0003
@0009You have no reason to thank me.
They call me the Sword Saint...@0003
But it is a false name.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016But...@0003
I can't imagine that what you
@0017say is true when I look at@0003
you now.@0003
You, standing before me now,
is the Sword Saint that I had@0003
always pictured in my mind.@0003
What...
What happened...?@0003
@0009@0017...Some things you will realize only
after you have lost something else.@0003
However, by the time that my
foolishness had left me...@0003
It was already too late.@0003
[03F3]
@000C@0010@0120@000C@0017Fiiiir!
Where are you?@0003
Fiiiir!@0003@0002
@000CFiiiiiir!@0003
@0009@0010@0113F-Father...
You are much too loud.@0003
@000C@0017Ah, Fir!
It's good to see you safe!@0003
@0009@0017Father...@0003
@000CIt's been a while since we
last met.@0003
I was getting worried that
we might not be able to see@0003
each other ever again.@0003
@0009Don't exaggerate, Father...@0003
We were together during our
marches.@0003
@000CBut we don't have many chances where
we can speak in private like this.@0003
@0017Now come, Fir.@0003
You can tell your father anything
that's on your mind.@0003
@0009@0017F-Father...@0003
I'm sorry, but I have
instructions from Master Roy.@0003
@000C@0017Do you?
Then I shall accompany you.@0003
@0009@0017Thank you, but I must fulfill
my tasks on my own, otherwise it@0003
wouldn't be training.@0003
I must be off now.@0003@0011
@000CHum...
Be careful, my daughter.@0003
[03F4]
@000C@0010@0120@000C@0017Fiiiiir!@0003
@000CFiiiiiiir!@0003@0002
@000CWhere are you, my daughter?@0003
@0009@0010@0113F-Father...@0003
You don't have to shout
so loudly...@0003
@000CI've been hearing some troubling
rumors, Fir.@0003
I hear that you are secretly seeing
this man in the army.@0003
@0009Oh...@0003
@000CIs it true, my daughter?
But fear not!@0003
I shall crush any bad influences
that may advance upon you!@0003
@0009N-No, you don't understand!@0003
@0009He's helping me with my training.
That's all.@0003
@000C@0017Oh, so you were looking for someone
to hone your skills with.@0003
But no worries, my daughter.
You have your father to spar with!@0003
Now come,
charge at me with full force!@0003
@0009@0017Um...@0003
I appreciate your consideration,
but it needs to be someone who@0003
can use a sword...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I'm sorryFather...@0003@0011
@000CHum...@0003
Take care of yourself,
my daughter.@0003
[03F5]
@000C@0010@0120@000C@0017Fiiiiir!@0003@0002
@000CFi-@0003
@0009@0010@0113I can hear you!@0003
@000CAh, Fir.
You were all right...@0003
@0009Father!
Enough is enough!@0003
I'll be quite fine on my own!
I don't need your overprotection!@0003
@000C@0017@0016......@0003
@000C@0016...Forgive me.
I was wrong...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Forgive me, my daughter...@0003
I just wanted to make up for
our lost time together.@0003
@0009Lost...time?@0003
@000CYes...@0003
When you were still a little girl,
both your mother and I were always@0003
training.@0003
I regret now that we didn't pay
enough attention to you.@0003
You never knew your parents'
warmth and protection...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016But you grew up to be a strong,
confident young woman.@0003
However, that isn't thanks to me.@0003
So I just wanted to be able to
help you anyway I could...@0003
@0009Father...
You were always kind and loving.@0003
Whenever I was about to fall
apart, you held me in your@0003
strong arms and comforted me...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Father...
I was happy.@0003
@000C@0017Fir...
Oh, my daughter.@0003
@0009F-Father!@0003
Please don't cry in a place
like this!@0003
[03F6]
@0009@0010@0130@000C@0010@0113@000C@0017Sir Noah!@0003
@0009@0017Hello, Fir.@0003
@000C@0017Sir Noah,
I have something to ask of you...@0003
@0009@0017Sure.
What is it?@0003
@000C@0017I want you to
spar with me.@0003
@0009@0017Oh...
For your training?@0003
@000C@0017Yes.@0003
I must experience all sorts
of swordplay to master the art.@0003
You taught me about fighting at
the Arena that time, and...@0003
I would truly appreciate it if
You would train me for a while.@0003
@0009@0017Well, if you say so.
It's fine with me.@0003
@000CReally?
Thank you!@0003
Let's start now, then...@0003
@0014Wha-!?@0080@000E@0003
@0009@0017Whoa!
Are you okay?@0003
@000CY-Yes!
I'm sorry!@0003
I'll get away now...@0003
@0009It's not like you to
trip like that.@0003
Are you hurt?
Let me see your knee...@0003
@000CN-No, I'm...f-fine!
We must get on with the duel!@0003
@0009Are you really okay?
You don't seem quite...well.@0003
@000CW-We fight!@0003
[03F7]
@0009@0010@0130@000C@0010@0113@0009Hello, Fir.@0003
@000C@0017S-Sir Noah...@0003
@0009?@0003
Are you okay?@0003
You should tell me if
you're not feeling well...@0003
@000CI-I'm fine.@0003
@0009You look like
you have a fever...@0003
@000CI-It's nothing!@0003
@0009But...
Your face looks red.@0003
@000CIt's nothing!@0003
It's just that I'm in a
little slump right now!@0003
@0009Fir?
Is something on your mind?@0003
If you need someone to talk to,
I'd be happy to...@0003
@000CS-Sir Noah!
This might sound rude, but..@0003
D-Don't talk to me anymore!@0003@0011@0007
@0009......
...Fir.@0003
[03F8]
@0009@0010@0130@000C@0010@0113@000C@0017!@0003
@0009Wait, Fir!
Don't go.@0003
I need to talk to you.@0003
@000CI-I...@0003
I swore to myself that I would
live by the sword.@0003
But...@0003
I find my mind wandering, and
I'm always thinking about you!@0003
@0009Fir...@0003
@000CG-Goodbye!@0003@0011
@0009Fir!@0003
@000C@0010@0113Wha-...@0003
@0009Do you remember
the first time we met?@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009Ever since then, I've wanted to
tell you something.@0003
But I couldn't muster up the guts
to do so.@0003
Even after we said goodbye to each
other, I've been regretting that I@0003
didn't tell you how I felt.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009I honestly thought it was a miracle
when we met on that island.@0003
And...@0003
Although I've been keeping it in
until now, I won't hesitate anymore.@0003
I have to tell you.@0003
@000CS-Sir Noah...@0003
@0009Fir,
I...@0003@0002
@0009I love you.@0003
[03F9]
@000C@0010@0113@0009@0010@0114@000C@0017...Um.....@0003
@000CUm, excuse me,
are you Rutger?@0003
@0009...What do you want?@0003
@000C@0017I was wondering if you would spar
with me, if we get the chance.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CI've also been training my sword
skills, and I've won at many arenas@0003
around the continent.@0003
You don't have to go easy on me!@0003
@0009@0017...I refuse.@0003
@000CWhy?
Is it because I'm a woman?@0003
@0009...When I swing my sword,
I do so to kill people.@0003
I have no interest in using
my sword for play.@0003
@000C! Play!?@0003@0009@0011
@000CW-Wait...!@0003@0002
...He thought that I was playing
with my sword?@0003
I wanted to learn from him because
his blade is so sharp and he has@0003
no hesitation at all...@0003
[03FA]
@000C@0010@0113@0009@0010@0114@000C@0017Rutger!
We fight!@0003
@0009...Get out of my way.@0003
@000CNo.@0003
I will not move until you understand
that I am serious.@0003
Draw your sword!@0003
I have been serious about training
my skills, and I will not allow you@0003
to say that it is simply for play.@0003
And I want to become stronger,
so I want to learn from you.@0003
@0009...I told you that I use
my sword to kill others.@0003
@000CYes, I know.
But my...@0003
@0009If I draw my blade here,
you will die.@0003
Is that your wish?@0003
@000C! ...@0003
@0009And you have no intention of
killing me, either, do you?@0003
@000CWell...@0003
@0009That's why I say you're
just playing around.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009......@0016@0003@0011
@000C...I just...@0003
...But maybe I was being rude,
I should apologize when I see@0003
him next.@0003
[03FB]
@000C@0010@0113@0009@0010@0114@000CRutger.@0003
Wait, please don't glare at
me like that...@0003
I'm not here to fight.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CBut your skills are indeed impressive.
I still see you as a goal to reach.@0003
I wish I could be as strong as you...@0003
@0009@0017...Just be yourself.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009My blade is covered with blood.@0003
There is no need to see your goal
in that.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0017Someone once told me...@0003
'All paths of the sword lead to
one place.'@0003
I still have yet to find out if
that is true or not, but I can@0003
say that your sword is definitely
on some kind of path.@0003
But I still have much to learn.@0003
@0009@0017...Think what you will.@0003

[03FC]
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0115@000C@0017!@0003
@0009...I see you haven't lost
your skill.@0003
@000C...Rutger...@0003I keep telling you not to suddenly@0003
pop up and attack from behind!@0003
Geez, I'd never have enough lives
if I had to put up with you.@0003
@0009@0017Ha...@0003
It is already decided that I am the
first one to land a blow on your back.@0003
@000C@0017All right, obviously we were out to kill
each other when we were on different sides.@0003
But why the hell are you trying to slice
me in half when we're on the same side?@0003
@0009The others bore me.@0003I need someone of your strength
to duel with.@0003
@000CSo I'm gonna get killed because
you're bored.@0003
Wonderful.@0003
@0009Oh, sure...@0003
As if you've ever let my sword
touch you.@0003
@000CWhat do you think!
I want to live too, you know!@0003
@0009I'll get you next time
for sure.@0003@0011
@000CGeez...@0003
[03FD]
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0115@000C@0016.....@0003@0009@0011@000C@0011@0007
@000C@0010@0115@0016@0017Hey!
I thought I told you to stop that!@0003
Persistent, aren't you...!@0003
@0009@0010@0114@0016.....@0003
@000C@0016...?
You seem to be in a bad mood.@0003
Did something happen?@0003
@0009@0016.....@0003
@000C@0016Lemme guess...@0003
You found a personal enemy in
Bern's ranks?@0003
@0009!@0003
@000CGuess I hit the spot.@0003
Then how come you're taking it
out on me?@0003
@0009...I saw the soldier who led the
attack on my hometown, Bulgar.@0003
But when I reached him...
he was already dead.@0003
It was you, Dieck.@0003
Those swords marks...it had
to be you.@0003
@000C... Sorry.@0003
Had I known, I would have left him
to you.@0003
@0009...This is a battlefield.
Enemies don't belong to anybody.@0003
@000CRutger...
Can't you relax a little more?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0011
@000C@0016You can't rush through life...@0003
[03FE]
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0115@000C@0017Rutger, you all right?
You don't look well.@0003
@0009...I'm having trouble sleeping.@0003
@000CIs it about the leader of the Bulgar
attack you saw the other day?@0003
@0009...No.
Well...maybe.@0003
Even after I see him dead, my
nightmares still persist.@0003
At that attack...
They left only me alive...@0003
The reason was because I...
didn't look like a Sacae native.@0003
@000CTough to kill someone with the
same colored skin.@0003
But you do have Sacaen blood in@0003
you, don't you?@0003@0009Yes.@0003
My father's mother and my mother's
father were Sacaean.@0003
Bulgar is near Bern's border, so there
are a lot of mixed people there.@0003
But usually the Sacaean side is
stronger in mixed children's@0003
in mixed children's appearances.@0003
But I...@0003
Only in me did the Bern side come
come out more, so I was kept alive...@0003
The people of Bulgar...they were
kind to me, even though I looked@0003
different...@0003
But they...they were killed,
so brutally!@0003
I must destroy Bern...!@0003
That one man isn't enough to
satisfy my revenge...@0003
@000CI thought you had some kind of,
burden, but now I see it clearly...@0003
@0017Well, I guess I'll go along
with you.@0003
@0009@0017I have no need for sympathy!@0003
@000C@0017Come on, you know how strong I
am, right?@0003
If you really want to take on Bern,
there's no better ally than me.@0003
What do you say?@0003
@0009@0017...Suit yourself.@0003
@000C@0017And so I will.
Well then, let's go, partner!@0003@0011
@0009@0017Dieck...
I'm sorry.@0003
[03FF]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@011E@0009@0017Yo, Ward.
Come here for a sec.@0003
@000CEh?
Yes?@0003
@0009Pay more attention to what's
going on around you.@0003
@0009You could have nine lives, and it
still wouldn't be enough, the way@0003
you fight.@0003
@000CBut Bro, I'm still alive.
With my strength, I can crush@0003
anything that crosses my path...@0003
@0009The idiots who said that in the
past all got killed early on.@0003
@0009Don't worry me so much.@0003
@000CWell...@0003
@000CIf you say so.@0003
@0009Got it?
Good.@0003
You don't have to go all out
all the time.@0003
[0400]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@011E@0009@0017...Ward.@0003
@000CBro!
Did you see me just now!?@0003
@000CI took on 3 guys with one
swing...@0003
@0009Do you even remember what I
told you before?@0003
@000CHuh?
Um...@0003@0002
@000CAttack?@0003
@0009No!@0003
I told you to pay more attention
to what's going on around you.@0003
@000CBut Bro, fighting like that just
doesn't sit well with me.@0003
I'm getting stronger, too.@0003
I'll get strong enough so I can
crush anything that comes at me.@0003@0011
@0009Ward!@0003
@0009@0017...That kid can't sit still,
can he.@0003
[0401]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@011E@000C@0017Bro...@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
@000C@0017Sorry, you win.@0003
The other day I almost got killed, and
then I remembered what you told me.@0003
Maybe I was getting carried away...@0003
@0009I see.@0003
@000CSo after that, I've been
following your advice...@0003
@0009@0017I can see that you have, 'cause
you're still alive.@0003
If you can pay attention to the
bigger picture, you won't get@0003
killed so easy.@0003
With your strength, you can
impress people without always@0003
rushing in like that.@0003
@000C@0017...Bro, you okay?
You're like, praising me.@0003
It feels...weird.@0003
@0009Ah, shut up.
Come on, let's go.@0003
[0402]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@0115@0009@0017Bro, what do you think
about our employer?@0003
@000C@0017That kid, Roy?@0003
What do you think?@0003
@0009I like him.@0003
He's pretty impressive for one
so young.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, he is.@0003
But...
He's young.@0003
Too young.@0003
@0009Well, I guess you're right,
but...@0003
@000CI understand why you support him.@0003
He's a nice guy, and he's got
brains and guts.@0003
But...
The battles now are still easy.@0003
When he gets to a battle, in a
life or death situation...@0003
That's when we see how he really
is...@0003 
[0403]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@0115@000C@0017Years ago...when I just became a
mercenary...@0003
I was only concerned about
spreading my fame...@0003
@0009@0017Really...
You had such times, too.@0003
@000C@0017Our squad was sent right in the
middle of the enemy lines.@0003
We were supposed to go deep into
Bern and kill the enemy leader.@0003
We waited underground for days...
and then the time came.@0003
And when we went out...dozens of
rained down on us...@0003
@0009!@0003
Why...?@0003
@000COur employer...@0003
He purposely put us there so he
could buy time for himself to escape.@0003
Our squad was decimated.
They killed us all.@0003
All except for me.@0003
I was kept alive for torturing
purposes.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016We mercenaries are simply disposables
in their eyes.@0003
That's the norm.@0003
If you don't think like that, you won't
be able to take it.@0003
@0009But...that kid, Roy...@0003
@000C@0017Yeah...he's different.
If I'd only known him before...@0003
[0404]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@0115@000CSo...@0003
Looks like we're both still
alive.@0003
@0009Yeah.@0003
@000C...Funny, isn't it?@0003
@0009What is?@0003
@000CWe're mercenaries.@0003
We don't give a who wins, all
We care about are our money and@0003
our lives.@0003
We're best to just walk off
rather than stay and get killed.@0003
But...it's weird.@0003
We're going through all of these
incredibly tough battles, and I@0003
still don't feel like running
off.@0003
Roy...he makes me feel like I
can fight and die for his purpose@0003
and not have any regrets.@0003
@0009Of course.
I feel that way too.@0003
[0405]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@0129@000C@0017Hey, Captain!@0003
@0009@0017Thany, please.
Not 'Captain'.@0003
@000CWhy?@0003
Back in Ilia, we always call
our leader the captain.@0003
@0009It doesn't suit me.@0003
@000CAll right, um...@0003
Okay, then I'll call you
Bro, like Lott and Ward do.@0003
@0009No.@0003
@000CShoot, can't use that,
either?@0003
@0009Just call me Dieck,
like you always have.@0003
@000CNo!@0003
I feel left out when they call
Bro and I just call you Dieck.@0003
@0009Don't be ridiculous.
Come on, let's go.@0003
@000C@0017Hey wait!
Dieck!@0003
[0406]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@0129@0009Thany, I see you fighting on
your own a lot.@0003
@000CYeah.@0003
I'm on a pegasus, see?
I have a different movement pace
than the others, so it's easier@0003
to fight on my own...@0003
@0009All right then, I want you to
slow down your pace from now on.@0003
@000C@0017What?
But I'm doing fine on my own!@0003
@0009@0017Everyone gets worried when you
just go charging in like that.@0003
@000CBut if I get stronger...@0003
@0009Can you stand up against a legion
in the thousands?@0003
@000C...Um, no.@0003
@0009Then make sure you match your pace with
the others, to make sure we can win.@0003
@000CTo make sure we can win, huh?@0003
@0009Wars aren't fought alone,
you know.@0003
@000CYeah...@0003
[0407]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@0129@000CDieck!@0003
See how I've been adjusting my
pace to the others lately?@0003
@0009Yeah...@0003
But you shouldn't trust them
too much, either.@0003
@000C@0017Huh?@0003
That's different than what you
were saying before!@0003
@0009@0017What I said was a guideline for
fighting.@0003
What I'm saying now is a guideline
for a mercenary.@0003
@000CFor a mercenary...@0003
@0009A mercenary has to fend for himself.
No one's gonna be looking out for you.@0003
You've got to be skeptical.@0003
You should even be wary that I might
be giving out orders just so I can@0003
ensure my own safety.@0003
@000CThat's not a problem.@0003
@0009Eh?@0003
@000CYou wouldn't be thinking things
like that.@0003
@0009You never know.@0003
@000CI know.
So do Lott and Ward.@0003
That's why we can entrust our
lives to you.@0003
@0009...Don't get cocky, kid.@0003
@000CTeehee...@0003
[0408]
@0009@0010@0116@000C@0010@0122@000CHello, Oujay!@0003
@0009@0017L-Lady Lilina!@0003
@000C@0017Oh, don't act so tense like that...@0003
I just wanted to talk to some people
from Ostia.@0003
@0009@0017Um...all right.@0003
@000C@0017Talk to me.
Let's see...@0003
Tell me about your hometown.@0003
@0009@0017My hometown?@0003
Well...
It was just an ordinary village.@0003
We were poor...@0003The reason I came all the way
out to the city was to make money@0003
to feed my younger brothers...@0003
@000C@0017You have brothers?
How nice.@0003
Do you have any sisters?@0003
@0009@0017...I have one sister who's a
little younger than me.@0003
@000CReally?
What's she like?@0003
Is she cute?
Does she look like you?@0003
@0009@0017I...I was still young, so I don't
really remember.@0003
But I remember holding her hand.@0003
Her hand...it was so small and
delicate.@0003
@000C@0017That's so sweet...@0003
I've always wanted a younger
sister, too.@0003
[0409]
@0009@0010@0116@000C@0010@0122@000COujay, how is your sister
doing?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Is she at home?@0003
Or did she come to Ostia with
you?@0003
If she did, I would like to...@0003
@0009@0017I'm sorry, Lady Lilina,
but...@0003
@000C@0017Tell me.
I'd love to meet her.@0003
@0009@0017......
She's not around anymore.@0003
@000CWhat?
Why...?@0003
@0009Lady Lilina...@0003
Our village was very poor.
...It is the men who become work hands.@0003
Girls...have no place.@0003
We don't have any extra bread, either,
so...@0003
When a girl is born in a poor family,
we put pretty clothes on her and@0003
leave her in a faraway town.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009...We were poor.@0003
I don't hold anything against
my family.@0003
If we hadn't done what we did...
we would have just starved.@0003
@000C...I'm sorry...@0003
@0009Lady Lilina?@0003
@000CI'm sorry...
I...didn't know anything...@0003
I didn't know anything...
and I...I just...@0003
@0009D-Don't cry!
Please, Lady Lilina...@0003
[040A]
@0009@0010@0116@000C@0010@0122@0009@0017Lady Lilina, about the other day...
I'm sorry.@0003
I said more than I should have.@0003
@000COujay.@0003
@0009Yes?@0003
@000CI'm sorry, I was so stupid.
But I don't want to stay ignorant.@0003
Right now I don't know anything
running a country, but I'll learn.@0003
I shall make Ostia a country in
which our children can always@0003
be happy.@0003
@0009...Lady Lilina, please don't
strain yourself.@0003
My brothers are doing fine
thanks to the Ostian marquess.@0003
Even God can't save all
of the people.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016@0017But I can say this,
Lady Lilina...@0003
My sister, wherever she is...@0003
She would have liked you very much.@0003
[040B]
@0009@0010@0126@0009Hmm...
I need to work on my twirls more...@0003
@000C@0010@0116@0017Oh...@0003
@0009@0017!?@0003
Hey!
You saw my secret training!@0003
@000C@0017N-No!
I didn't mean to!@0003
@0009@0017That doesn't matter!@0003
I can't let you go back alive,
now that you've seen me.@0003
For an entertainer, being seen
practicing a trick means death!@0003
@000C@0017D-Death?@0003
@0009@0017Wait, was that right?
Anyway, it's that embarrassing!@0003
@000C@0017I'm really sorry.
I didn't know.@0003
@0009@0017Hm...
Well, I guess what's done is done.@0003
Hey, if you saw my dance, you might
as well tell me how it was!@0003
What did you think?@0003
@000C@0017Uhm...
Well, it was really pretty.@0003
Although it was a little...
revealing.@0003
@0009@0017Do you think so?@0003
You know, this dance's main part
is still to come.@0003
It becomes really amazing towards
the end.@0003
@000C@0017Wow...it does?@0003
@0009@0017@0003
Hey!@0003
You were thinking naughty thoughts,
weren't you?@0003
@000C@0017N-No no!
I wasn't!@0003
[040C]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0116@0009Hmm~~~@0003
@000C@0017Oh, Lalum.@0003
@0009?@0003
Oh, you're that guy who was
who was spying on me.@0003
@000C...That's a misunderstanding...@0003
@0009@0017Well, you praised my dancing,
so I'll forgive you.@0003
@000CYou really like to dance,
huh?@0003
@0009I guess.
It's fun.@0003
I meet a lot of people when I
travel around, and they all@0003
love my dancing.
That sort of thing.@0003
@000CI see.@0003
@0009Hey, I know.@0003
Do you want me to show you the rest
of the dance from the other day?@0003
@000C@0017R-Really?@0003
@0009@0017Do you want to see it?
You do, right?@0003
Then tell me that you do.@0003
@000CI... I want to see it.@0003
@0009Ah well, I guess I can show it
to you.@0003
This is the sixth of the seven
dances I've mastered so far.@0003
And it's called...@0003
@000CIt's called...?@0003
@0009Dance Number 6.@0003
@000COh.
It's kind of...ordinary.@0003
@0009@0017Hey!@0003
You were disappointed just now,
weren't you.@0003
@000CN-No!
I wasn't.@0003
@0009Yes, you were.@0003
@000CNo, I wasn't!@0003
@0009Yeah, sure!@0003
Nope, changed my mind.
I won't show it to you!@0003
@000CN-No...@0003
[040D]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0116
@000CLalum!@0003
@0009What?@0003
Oh, I know.@0003
You just wanted to see that dance
so badly, right?@0003
@000CYour dancing...@0003
I think I have seen it
somewhere before.@0003
@0009Huh?
You have?@0003
@000CYeah.@0003
A small band of entertainers once
stopped by my village when I was@0003
younger.@0003
I went to watch them...and a
little girl was dancing in the@0003
center.@0003
She tripped a few times and made
some mistakes, but she was trying@0003
really hard.@0003
I was going through some tough
times back then, but that girl's@0003
dancing kind of cheered me up.@0003
@0009@0017Hm...@0003
I don't remember it.@0003
@000C@0017I didn't think so.
But it was really nice.@0003
You're probably cheering up
a lot of people with your@0003
dancing, where ever you go.@0003
@0009You're embarrassing me now!
But thanks, Oujay.@0003
Tell you what.@0003
I'll show you one of my
special dances some time.@0003
@000CSpecial...?@0003
@0009It's really amazing!@0003
@000C@0017Wow...it is?@0003
@0009@0017Hey!@0003
You were thinking naughty
thoughts again, weren't you?@0003
@000C@0017N-No!
I wasn't!@0003
[040E]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0117@0009Oh...
Hello, Garret.@0003
@000C@0017Damn...
So it's you, eh?@0003
I'm telling you, I'm not going
to be your friend or anything...@0003
...Hey.@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000CYou had an expensive-looking
bracelet on your wrist.@0003
Where'd it go?@0003
@0009@0017...You have keen eyes.@0003
@000C@0017Well, you hafta be alert when
you're doing banditry.@0003
Did you take it off or something?@0003
@0009@0017I gave it away.@0003
@000C@0017Huh?
Gave it away?@0003
@0009@0017I met an old blind man on the
way here.@0003
He said that he would starve,
so I gave it to him...@0003
@000C@0017Oh man!
You princesses are so damn gullible!@0003
He's obviously tricking you.@0003
He's making you pity him so that
you'll give him money.@0003
@0009@0017But...
Maybe he's telling the truth...@0003
Listen kid, there's no way in hell
that he's telling the truth.@0003
After he gets his money, he'll be
laughing at you as you walk away.@0003
You're soft 'cause you don't
know the real world.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016But...@0003
@000CW-Well...@0003
I mean, it's your bracelet, so you
can do whatever you want with it...@0003

[040F]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0117@0009Hello, Garret.@0003
@000C@0017You again?@0003
I told you before, I ain't
your friend.@0003
There's no telling what'll happen
to you if you stay with me so much.@0003
@0009@0017No.
You're a good person.@0003
@000C@0017Ha!
Would you listen to that!@0003
You really think you can tell
good from bad in the real world?@0003
Even after you were so easily
tricked the other day.@0003
@0009...But...@0003
@000CI'm here for the money.@0003
And if I don't make any, I'll
just go back to being a bandit.@0003
@0009...In that case, why don't
you just attack me right now?@0003
@000C...What?@0003
@0009@0017I have magic tomes, ribbons...
a lot of expensive items.@0003
You can sell them all for money.
Right now, there's no one around...@0003
You should just take all my@0003
belongings and run off.@0003
@000C@0016...If you understand that much,
@0016@0017then why are you talking to me?@0003
What if I really did do that?@0003
@0009@0017If you did...then it would be my
foolishness.
But I don't think that you would
do something like that.@0003
I just feel that you're not a bad
person.@0003
I...trust you.@0003@0011
@000C@0016...Dammit!@0016@0003
@0017How could I do anything with her
looking at me like that...@0003
[0410]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0117@0009Hello, Garret.@0003
@000C@0017Hey...@0003
@0009@0017Yes?@0003
You said you gave your bracelet
to that blind guy, right?@0003
@000C@0017What would you do if you met
him again?@0003
@0009Well...@0003
I guess I don't have to ask.@0003
@000CYou would get tricked just as
easily as you did before and@0003
do anything for him, I assume.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Why do you care so much for
total strangers?@0003
What are you gonna get from
helping them?@0003
You should just ignore them.@0003
@0009...If I see someone in need, I
would feel that I want to do@0003
something to help him.@0003
If I met that old man again,
I would probably give him@0003
him something...again.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016...Oh well, I guess some
people are just born stupid.@0003@0002
Oh yeah...
I have to give you this.@0003
@0009?@0003
@0017?
What is this?@0003
It's beautiful...@0003
@000C@0017I dunno.@0003
Some old guy who said he'd met
you came up to me the other day.@0003
He asked me to give you this.@0003
He also said that he was really
grateful for you.@0003
@0009But...
I met that old man way back in...@0003
@000CI-I don't know!@0003
Anyway, he wanted me to give
this to you.@0003
Just take it.@0003@0011
@0009Garret...@0003
[0411]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@0117@000CHey, you're a sailor,
right?@0003
@0009Hm?
Yeah, I am.@0003
@000CDo sailors make a lot
of money?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016Well, we used to.
But now...it's not so good.@0003
@0017I had to stoop down to piracy.@0003
@000COh...
Sorry to bother you, then.@0003
@0009What?
I thought you wanted something.@0003
@000CI was thinking you might hire me
on your ship, but it's kinda@0003
stupid to go from a bandit to
being a pirate.@0003
I just...don't want to rob people
to live anymore...@0003
@0009@0017Hey, not so fast.
I'm gonna quit piracy.@0003
It doesn't suit me anyway.@0003
I'm going back to being a trader
after the war ends.@0003
I could hire you to do odd jobs
around the ship if you want.@0003
[0412]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@0117
@0009Hey, Garret.@0003
Try spinning around in the spot
a few times.@0003
@000CWhat?
What kind of joke is this?@0003
@0009Just think of it as a sailor's
test.@0003
@000C@0017Damn.
Fine.@0003
@0016.........@0016
All right, I did it.@0003
@0009Good.@0003
Now try walking straight over
here.@0003
@000C@0016......@0080@000D@0003
@0016...Whoa.@0080@000D@0003
@0009You're gonna get seasick.@0003
You'll have to fix that if
you want to be a seafarer.@0003
@000BWhat?
A grown man, seasick?@0003
@0009That doesn't make a difference.@0003
Even grown men puke their guts
out when they're still not used@0003
to the rocking of the ship.@0003
And the outer seas can be nasty.@0003
We sometimes come across storms
that could flip the ship over.@0003
Well, I suppose you'll get@0003
used to it after a month or so.@0003
@000BA month?@0003
I'm gonna be seasick for a
whole month?@0003
@0009Of course.
The oceans' huge.@0003
We sometimes won't see land
for an entire year.@0003
@000BWhoa...@0003
Maybe I don't want to do
this after all.@0003
[0413]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@0117@000C@0017Well...@0003
Fast cash isn't easy to
find, is it.@0003
Sailing seems like a worse
option whenever I hear about it.@0003
@0009@0017You think so?
The sea's a great place.@0003
@000C@0017But you're always on the water,
right?@0003
It's just endlessly blue@0003
wherever you look.@0003
@0009@0017No, the sea's not only blue.
Sometimes it turns gold.@0003
@000C@0017Huh?@0003
@0009@0017It's true.@0003
When the sun comes up in the east...
or when it sets in the west...@0003
The whole ocean is illuminated
into a beautiful gold...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0017@0016Dawn is great as well,
but I prefer the sunset.@0003
When you're sailing towards
the setting sun, it's just...@0003
@000C@0017But you can't make any
money with the sunset.@0003
@0009...You have no aesthetic sense.@0003
@0017All right, I'll let you on my
ship sometime.@0003
You can't call yourself a true
sailor until you see that beauty.@0003
@000CThis isn't going to
make me any money...@0003
[0414]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0117@0009@0017Eeeeeeek!
A bandit!@0003
@000CYup, I'm a bandit.
Got a problem?@0003
...Hey, I was wondering...
Do entertainers make a lot of money?@0003
@0009@0017Huh?@0003
@000C@0017I can't be doing banditry forever.@0003
I've been looking for a job that
would make me a decent amount@0003
of money.@0003
@0009@0017Hmm...@0003
I don't know if we make a lot
of money, but...@0003
@000C@0017Hey, do you think there's
some kind of entertainment that@0003
I can do?@0003
@0009@0017Well...@0003
What I know best is dancing,
so...@0003
Perhaps there's one that
you could do...@0003
@000C@0017There is?
Teach me, please!@0003
@0009@0017Well...
All right.@0003
I'll teach you next time.
@0014See you!@0003@0011
@000C@0017I'm counting on you...@0003
[0415]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0117@0009No no!
You've got it all wrong!@0003
@000C@0017W-What?
It was like this, right?@0003
You step like this, and
then you twirl...@0003
Am I doing something wrong?@0003
@0009Just doing the moves isn't enough.
You have to have charm.@0003
With an expression like that,
everyone'll run screaming.@0003
@000CShut up!@0003
This is the face I was
born with!@0003
@0009Oh...?
Talking back, are we?@0003
Fine, then.@0003
I won't teach you anymore.@0003
@000CErg...O-Okay...
Charm, right?@0003
@0009@0017You have to always be smiling.@0003
Come on, give it a try.
Let's see a smile...@0003
@000CS-Smile...
All right...@0003
......@0003
@0009Hahahahaha!@0003
@000C@0017What're you laughing at!?@0003
@0009@0017Okay, what more do you need...
@0017Oh, I know.@0003
You don't look sexy enough.@0003
@000CS-Sexy!?
Look, I'm a guy.@0003
Can't you imagine how creepy I'd
look if I tried to be sexy with@0003
this face?!@0003
@0009@0017Oh...?
Talking back again?@0003
@000C@0017All right, all right!
I'll do it.@0003
I'll do anything you say!
Here...how's that?@0003
Do I look sexy enough now!?@0003
@0009@0017Good!
You're doing well.@0003
Hahahahahaha!@0003
@000C@0017...I swear, she's just
playing with me...@0003
[0416]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0117@000C@0017Hey!
Lalum!@0003
@0009@0017Yeah?@0003
@000C@0017You were just making fun of me,
weren't you!@0003
You were teaching me how to
dance, huh?@0003
Well, that was nothing but a
load of crap!@0003
When I danced in front of the
others, like you showed me, they@0003
all laughed their assess off!@0003
@0009@0017Really?
Good!@0003
@000C@0017What!?
Why you...!@0003
@0009@0017Look.@0003PNL
[0417]
@0009@0010@0117@000C@0010@012C@000C@0017Hey, you.@0003
@0009Yeah?@0003
@000CYou...
You're a bandit.@0003
@0009Hm?
Yeah, I am.@0003
You...Are you a thief?
Hey, do thieves...@0003
@000CShut up!
Don't come near me!@0003
@0009What!?@0003
@000CI freaking hate bandits!@0003
I feel like tearing my hair
out when I hear about them.@0003
@0009Oh, is that so?@0003
It's not like I care about what
you like or don't like, anyway.@0003
So you came to me just to say that?
You must have a lot of free time.@0003
@000CHmph!@0003@0011
@0009...Huh.
What was that all about?@0003
[0418]
@0009@0010@0117@000C@0010@012C@0009@0017Hm?@0003
@000C...Oh.@0003
@0009Damnit.
You again?@0003
@000CUgh, I saw a bandit.
My day is ruined now.@0003
@0009Heh.@0003
Like you're any different.
You steal as well.@0003
You ain't got any right
to criticize me.@0003
@000CHa, I only steal from the rich.@0003
@0009Oh, so we're playing the
the good thief, are we?@0003
That doesn't justify...@0003
@000CHa, maybe not.@0003
What I'm doing is theft,
I won't deny that.@0003
But...
I will say this.@0003
I'll never, ever do things like
burning villages down and hurting@0003
innocent people.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016...Well...
Sorry.@0003@0011
[0419]
@0009@0010@0117@000C@0010@012C@0009@0017Hm?@0003
@000C...Oh.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016You again?
Damnit.@0003
@0009Hey, wait.@0003
@000CWhat do you want!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016I'm a bandit, like you say.@0003
I've plundered villages and killed
innocent people.@0003
But...let me say this.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009I...I hate bandits as well...and
I hate the way I've been living@0003
like them.@0003
That's all.@0003@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017...Yeah.@0003
[041A]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0117@000C@0017Whoa!?@0003
@0009Uh?
What?@0003
@000CWhat the hell!?
Are you an enemy?@0003
@0009I, I...@0003
I Gonzales.@0003
@000CI wasn't asking your name.
Well, I guess you ain't an enemy.@0003
@0009I Gonzales.@0003
@000C...How were you ever let into
this army?@0003
You're almost a complete opposite
of me.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I mean, look at what you're wearing!
You look like a total brigand.@0003
People'll be running away from you.
@0009......@0003
@000C@0017Well anyway,
you should learn from me.@0003
@0009@0017Learn?@0003
You?@0003
@000C...What?
You got a problem with that?@0003
@0009N-No...@0003
Okay.
I learn from you.@0003
@000C@0017Not 'you'.@0003
I'm Master Garret.@0003
Got that?@0003
@0009@0017G...
G...?@0003
Strange name...@0003
@000CLook at yours!@0003
[041B]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0117@000CHey.
You want something?@0003
@0009@0017You...
G...g...@0003
G...?@0003
@000C@0017Master Garret.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah...you that.
Here. I give you.@0003
@000C@0017Hey!
Guess you aren't so useless.@0003
@0009@0017You like this?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, my mom used to pick these in
the mountains when I was just a kid.@0003
The bittersweet seeds are the
best part!@0003
@0009@0017Mom...
You have parents.@0003
I not have...@0003
I don't have any parents now, either.@0003
@000CShe was killed in a bandit attack
when I was just a kid.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016But I survived.@0003
I found every single one of those
bandits and put them through what@0003
they did to us.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016It took 8 years.@0003@0002
But...now I have nothing.
I just... don't have anything else
to live for anymore.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Damn...
Why am I telling you this.@0003
[041C]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0117@000CHey, Gonzales.@0003
@0009@0017You...
G...@0003
@000C@0017Master Garret.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah...you that.
Here.@0003
I give you.@0003
@000C@0017Whoa whoa...@0003
You didn't have to bring the whole
tree with you.@0003
@0009@0017You like this.@0003
@000C@0017Well yeah, I do, but this
is going a little overboard...@0003
Ah well, who cares.
Thanks.@0003
You want some?@0003
@0009@0017I won't eat.
I don't eat strange things.@0003
@000C...And what's that supposed
to mean?@0003
Hm?@0003
...Looks like I better get going.
Come on, Gonzales.@0003
@0017Let's go.@0003
@0009Yeah.@0003
[041D]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0118@0009@0017You!
Wait!@0003
@000CYou...
You must be a Pegasus Knight
from Ilia.@0003
Pleased to meet you.
I am Alan, knight of Pherae.@0003
@0009I'm Tate.
You know, do you always...@0003
@000C@0017So this is a pegasus?
I've never seen one up close.@0003
It has a cute face.@0003
@0009@0017Do you think so...?
No, wait.@0003
What I was saying was, do you
always fight like that?@0003
@000C@0017Yes.
Is there something wrong with it?@0003
@0009@0017Don't you think you're being
too rash?@0003
The way you fight, you never know
what'll happen to you.@0003
@000CYes, the way I fight can
be dangerous.@0003
But, you see...@0003@0002
Oh, I shouldn't be chatting like
this during a battle, or I will@0003
give the enemy an advantage.@0003
I must get going.@0003@0011
@0009...There's something wrong with you.@0003
[041E]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0118@0009@0017Wait!
Wait!@0003
@000CTate?
Is something wrong?@0003
@0009I have to tell you now.
Why do you fight like that?@0003
Even the way you thrust your spear...@0003
Why do you rely on brute strength
to attack?@0003
It makes it harder to evade a
retaliation that way.@0003
@000CWell...@0003
I see you've been watching me
carefully.@0003
@0009Huh?
N-No...it's not that!@0003
It's just that...@0003
How could someone miss when
you're fighting like that?@0003
That's all.@0003
@000C?@0003
@0009Anyway, what I wanted to say was,
why don't you be more careful@0003
when you fight?@0003
@000CI understand what you're saying.
But I can't pull back.@0003
@0009You're still saying that?
But the way you fight...@0003
@000CIn battle, the first ones to match
blades with the enemy are us, the@0003
knights.@0003
The enemy will judge the entire
army's strength by looking at@0003
how we fight.@0003
That's why I have to show them
our power.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016If I cringe even a little, that
adds to the enemy's morale.@0003
If there is hesitation in my moment,
it will have a bad effect on the@0003
whole army...@0003
That's why I have to charge.@0003
I have to keep pushing forward,
for all of our sakes.@0003
@0009...I see.@0003
...I thought you were just an idiot
who couldn't do anything but charge...@0003
@000C?
Did you say something?@0003
@0009...No, nothing.@0003
@000CI'm sorry, but I have to fight
like this.@0003
Still, your advice was useful,
too.@0003
Give me some more when you get
the chance.@0003
@0009...All right, I suppose.@0003
[041F]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0118@0009@0017...You haven't changed your
fighting, I see.@0003
@000CTate.@0003
@0009How long are you going to
continue fighting like that?@0003
I understand what you're saying...
But if you die, it's all over.@0003
@000CI understand that.@0003
There is only so much I can do
on my own.@0003
But I'm a knight, therefore...@0003
@0009Then...
@0017Shall I stay at your side?@0003
@000C@0017You would...?@0003
@0009@0017I-If I leave someone like you alone,
I get worried and...can't concentrate!@0003
So if I support you from nearby,
it'll be easier for you, too, right?@0003
Or... am I not good enough...?@0003
@000C@0017Of course you are!@0003
You're strong, you can keep up
with my horse, and...@0003
With you around, it seems that
I can stay out of harm's way.@0003
I can trust you to guard my back.@0003
@0009@0017O-Oh...@0003
But...
I'm really all right for you...?@0003
@000COf course!
You're a strong warrior.@0003
You're perfect to fight
alongside with.@0003
@0009@0017No...
I meant...@0003
@000C?@0003
@0009So...the point is that...
I'm the one by your side...and...@0003
@000C?@0003
@0009...Nothing, forget it...
Well, come on, let's go.@0003
We have to hurry, right?@0003
@000CAll right, let's be off!@0003
[0420]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0118@000C@0017Where's the next enemy...@0003
@0009Alan.@0003
@000COh, Sir Marcus.@0003
@0009You have been performing
well lately.@0003
@000CThank you, sir.@0003
@0009However, it also looks as if you are
charging into enemy lines without@0003
thinking.@0003
Your duty is to protect Master Roy.
Am I wrong?@0003
@000C@0017But...@0003
Defeating the enemy leads to
Master Roy's safety!@0003
@0009@0017What if during your fighting,
Master Roy were to be hurt?@0003
@000CThat hasn't happened so far...@0003
@0009Does that mean it won't happen
at all?@0003
@000CThen...what must I do?@0003
@0009Take your time in battle.@0003
@000CTake my time...?@0003
[0421]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0118@000C@0017Sir Marcus.@0003
@0009Alan.
What is the matter?@0003
@000CI need you to teach me something...@0003
@0009Teach?@0003
@000CYou said to take my time in battle.@0003
Then was my fighting style up until
now wrong?@0003
@0009No.@0003
But you only use the one style
of fighting you are used to.@0003
@000CJust one...@0003
@0009Your courage is not a bad thing.
Rather, it should be praised.@0003
However, I am worried that you might
go berserk and go rushing in, leaving@0003
Master Roy behind.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009A true knight must think about what
he must do at a given moment and@0003
change his style accordingly.@0003
Charging is not always the best way.@0003
[0422]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0118@0009@0017Alan, your fighting has
been impressive lately.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
I am trying my best to change my
fighting style, as you told me.@0003
@0009I see.@0003
Hm, you seem able enough to
take over after me.@0003
@000CTake over?@0003
@0009I am old.@0003
I must make way for the young
generation, for Roy.@0003
I want you to take care of Roy
in my place.@0003
@000CM-Me...?@0003
Perhaps taking after an old man
like me would be embarrassing?@0003
@000C@0017Of course not!
It is an honor!@0003
I shall protect Master Roy with my life
and bring further prosperity to Pherae...@0003
@0009@0017Calm down.
I told you that your fire worried me.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009There is no need to get all worked up.
Master Roy is still young.@0003
You must grow with him, as a
knight, and as a person.@0003
[0423]
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@0119@0009@0017Lance!
How fares your sword today?@0003
@000C@0017Neither good nor bad,
Alan.@0003
@0009...Cool and calm as always,
I see.@0003
@0017The other day, I lagged behind
you, but not in this battle!@0003
Watch and learn from my skill,
Lance!@0003
@000C@0017Of course I'll watch you fight.@0003
Still, I have no intention of
losing to you from now on, either!@0003
@0009Well well, what confidence!@0003
I look forward to seeing you
after the battle.@0003
Well then, I'll be off.
You'd better come quickly too.@0003
[0424]
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@0119@000C@0017Alan, the battles will only get
tougher from now on.@0003
@0009@0017Yes.
But it's just what I want.@0003
@000C@0017Alan, I need to tell you something.
It's about when we lose.@0003
@0009When we lose?@0003
@000CRight.@0003
...If it looks like defeat would
be certain, you to take Master@0003
Roy and retreat.@0003
I will act as a decoy for the enemy
and buy time for you.@0003
@0009What?
But then you would be in danger.@0003
@000CSomeone has to do it.@0003
Then it might as well be me, who
has been in Pherae the shortest...@0003
@0009Don't be ridiculous!@0003
@000C...Alan?@0003
@0009If you're staying, then I will
as well.@0003
I won't allow you to go off alone
and commit suicide.@0003
@000CBut you're one of a long line of
knights serving the Pherae family.@0003
So you should take Master Roy
and flee...@0003
@0009How long you've served means nothing!@0003
Then let me ask you this.@0003
Has your loyalty been less than the
other knights?@0003
@000C@0016.....@0003
@0009@0016Can't say it yourself?
Then I'll answer for you.@0003
You're working just as hard as anybody!@0003
You've been as loyal as any of the
other knights!@0003
I know that best, because I've been your
partner ever since you came to Pherae!@0003
@000CAlan...@0003
@0009Don't do anything stupid, Lance.@0003
You're a necessary person to both
us and to Master Roy.@0003
[0425]
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@0119@000CAlan, about the other day...@0003
@0009You mean about when we lose?@0003
Are you still saying that you're
going to sacrifice yourself,@0003
or something ludicrous like that?@0003
@000CNo, I gave up that idea.@0003
...Your words were a slap in the face,
so to speak.@0003
Perhaps I was belittling myself because
I've been in Pherae the shortest.@0003
@0009Your work is second to none.
Except me, of course.@0003
@000CWhere does your confidence come from?
I really envy you sometimes.@0003
@0009Of course I have confidence.
How could I possibly lose to you?@0003
@000C...You'd better remember those words, for
you will be hearing them again from me.@0003
@0009Ha, never!@0003
See you after the battle!@0003
@000CYes.@0003
@0009@0017Lance?@0003
@000C@0016What?@0003
@0009@0016Even if we lose, you won't be the only one
staying behind and fighting to buy time!@0003
You'd better remember that!@0003
@000COf course!@0003
[0426]
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@011E@0009@0017You...@0003
You're Ward, the mercenary.@0003
@000CUh...@0003
Who are you?@0003
@0009I'm Alan, knight of Pherae.@0003
@000C@0017Oh, right.
You're one of our client's knights.@0003
Hey...
Are you a strong fighter?@0003
@0009Talk about being sudden...@0003Well, I can say I consider myself
to be fairly skilled.@0003
@000CAll right, good.
You want to have a duel?@0003
@0009@0017What, right now?@0003
@000C@0017Of course.@0003
@0009Very well.@0003
But I'm telling you now, I can't
go easy on you.@0003
@000CI would kill you if you do.@0003You'd better not be complaining
if you get hurt, either.@0003
@0009@0017Then...let's go!@0003@0009@0011@000C@0011@0007
@000C@0010@0118@0009@0010@011E
@0009W...Whoa...
You're better than I thought...@0003
@000CYou too...
Good fight!@0003
@0009Listen up,
next time I'll beat you.@0003
Got that?@0003
@000C...
Sure thing!@0003
[0427]
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@011E@000CHey you!@0003
@0009Ward!
How do you fare?@0003
@000CI've been looking for you.
Let's continue.@0003
We didn't finish the other day's
duel yet.@0003
@0009@0017Oh?@0003
I thought I won that match.@0003
@000C@0017No way, I was just getting warmed up.
You haven't seen the real me yet.@0003
@0009@0017Oh no?
@0017Then I shall go full force too!@0003
@000CBring it on!@0003@0009@0011@000C@0011@0007
@000C@0010@0118@0009@0010@011E
@0009Damn...
You are strong...@0003
@000CWe're even now...
Lance and I used to spar like this a lot.@0003
It's a great thing to have a partner
you can train with to see how much@0003
you've grown.@0003
@0009@0017I haven't lost yet!@0003
I'm really going all out next
time, you hear?!@0003
@000C@0017Of course.
I'll take you on any time!@0003
[0428]
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@011E@000C@0017Aaaarrr!@0003
@0009...!@0003
@0017You're...getting better, Ward!@0003
@000CY...You too!@0003
You become stronger every time
I see you.@0003
@0009@0017I'm still weak.
I must become stronger still.@0003
@000CHeh, then I'll become stronger
than that!@0003
No matter how many enemies come out,
I'll crush them all with my axe...@0003
@0009@0017Enemies...@0003
Ward.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009How do you see this battle?@0003
@000CWhat do you mean, how?@0003
@0009Do you think we can win?@0003
@000C@0017What?
Of course we'll win.@0003
I'm on this side, after all.@0003
How could we lose?
And we've also got you.@0003
No enemy would stand a chance
against the two of us.@0003@0009Haha...
That's right, I forgot.@0003
There's no way we could lose.@0003
It isn't like me at all to get
worried like that.@0003
All right!
Charge!@0003
@000COh yeah!
Let's go get 'em!@0003
[0429]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0119@0009Lance, have you gotten used to
the Pherae family yet?@0003
@000CYes, Sir Marcus.@0003
Everyone has been very good
to me, who is an outsider...@0003
@0009I see.
Good.@0003
@000C@0017You have been very caring as
well, Sir Marcus.@0003
@0009Well, we must have you work
especially hard.@0003
@000CEspecially?@0003
@0009You have something that the other
knights do not.@0003
@000CI do...?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
And that will help Master Roy
in the future.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
[042A]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0119@000C@0017Sir Marcus.@0003
@0009Yes, Lance?@0003
@000CYou said before that I had something
that the other knights do not.@0003
@0009That I did.@0003
@000CHowever, I cannot see what that
something is.@0003
I am but an ordinary knight.@0003
I think you see more in me than
there actually is.@0003
@0009I think not.@0003
@000CBut I was in a different band of knights
up until recently, so I have no idea what@0003
I can do for Master Roy...@0003
@0009There, you have it.@0003
@000CHuh?@0003
@0009You have experience in other areas.
The others do not.@0003
@000COh...@0003
@0009Master Roy will take Pherae's throne
in the future.@0003
And if only Pheraens are around him,
he will grow to be a person with@0003
limited views.@0003
We need someone like you who knows
knows other parts of the world.@0003
@000CWill my experience...
be of use?@0003
@0009You must make it so.@0003
Master Roy must grow to be an individual
with diverse beliefs.@0003
[042B]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0119@0009@0017Lance.@0003
@000C@0017Ah, Sir Marcus.@0003
@0009@0017Master Roy was telling me the other day
that you were telling him stories of@0003
other parts of the continent.@0003
@000CIf my experience can be of use to Master
Roy, then I shall do my best to teach him.@0003
@0009Good.@0003
Well, it seems that I can now
Retire without any worries.@0003
@000C@0017Sir Marcus, what are you saying?
We still have much to learn from you.@0003
@0009Not if we have you.@0003
You can take my place once
I am gone.@0003
@000CMe?
But I am not a native of Pherae...@0003
@0009Are you still worrying yourself over
matters like that?@0003
Master Roy certainly isn't.@0003
@000C...All right, then I shall take your
place when the time comes.@0003
But that is in the far future.@0003
You are still well, and you must
still be our example.@0003
@0009Well, maybe I can.
One never knows.@0003
[042C]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@011F@0009@0017You are Lott, the mercenary.
An axe-fighter with much endurance.@0003
@000CYou...You're Lance.@0003
@0009You seemed to have a troubled
look on your face.@0003
@000COh...
I was just thinking some things over.
Actually, this is perfect.@0003
Let me ask you something.@0003
@0009If it is something within my
meager knowledge.@0003
@000CAll right, axes are weak against
swords.@0003
This is just common sense.@0003
What I'm wondering about is why
it became like that.@0003
I just don't get the evidence
or physics behind it.@0003
That's what I was thinking about.@0003
@0009I see.@0003
Sometime earlier, I asked the same
exact question as you.@0003
I think I've found the answer after
I looked through several books on@0003
war strategy.@0003
@000CSo is it...
the weapon's weight?@0003
@0009Exactly.@0003
Because all weapons are designed bearing
in mind that humans will be wielding them,@0003
it is almost inevitable that minor flaws
and weaknesses would not appear.@0003
@000CSo...@0003
It's impossible for a weapon
to just make you really strong.@0003
@0009Right.@0003
In the past, many kinds of weapons
were made, and disappeared.@0003
Among them, the sword, axe, and
spear remained, thus creating what@0003
is commonly known as the weapon
triangle.@0003
@000CI see.@0003
But wait, what about weapons like
the Swordreaver?@0003
@0009Well, that brings us to a
whole different dimension.@0003
So...@0003
@000C..,Ah, I see...
Then what about...@0003
[042D]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@011F@0009@0017Knight to F6.@0003
@000CArmor Knight to E3.@0003
@0009Pegasus Knight to D1.@0003
@000CEr...@0003
Archer to B1.@0003
@0009Swordmaster to F1.@0003
Check.@0003
@000C@0016.....@0003
@0016...You win.@0003
@0009So it seems.@0003
@000C...Do you think the mistake was when
I moved that ballista 6 turns ago?@0003
@0009Yes, I think so.@0003
Where did you learn how to play?@0003
I learned it as one of the
requirements of a knight.@0003
@000CThere's an old war veteran living
where I come from.@0003
I couldn't find anyone to play in
the mercenary groups.@0003
But up against those who can play, it
looks like I don't stand a chance.@0003
@0009Well, if you can point our your
mistakes, that shows you have skill.@0003
I played with Alan the other day,
but it was over in 2 turns.@0003
[042E]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@011F@000C@0017How do you see this battle?@0003
@0009What do you mean?@0003
@000CDo you think we stand
a chance of winning?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016I honestly don't know.
Well, we are outnumbered severely.@0003
The enemy can afford to send out new
troops all the time, while we have@0003
to be careful about losing even
one troop.@0003
@000CYeah...@0003
Our starting conditions are just
so different.@0003
@0009But Master Roy sometimes thinks of plans
that are beyond my petty thoughts.@0003
He has done miraculously well
in the battles so far.@0003
Under his direction, I feel like
we could never lose.@0003
Master Roy will surely lead
us to victory.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
... You're not the one to favor
somebody just because he's your master.@0003
So if you say so, it must be true.
Then I better start believing, too...@0003
@0017In our victory, and our leader.@0003
[042F]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@0134@000C@0017Percival.@0003
@0009...Cecilia.@0003
Are your wounds all healed now?@0003
@000CYes,
I managed to survive.@0003
@0009I see.
...I'm sorry.@0003
I was there with you, but I
couldn't go to your aid.@0003
@000C@0017No, you only did what
you were supposed to do.@0003
Don't worry about it.@0003
@0009@0017Thank you for saying that...@0003
I plan on making up for it with
my work here.@0003
@000C@0017Yes.@0003
[0430]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@0134@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000C@0017Is something wrong,
Percival?@0003
@0009That village we just passed...
It was ruined.@0003
@000C...Yes, it was.@0003
@0009Probably most areas of this continent
look like that due to the war.@0003@000CYes...@0003
@0009We must put an end
to this conflict...@0003
So we can help those who
cannot defend themselves...@0003
@000CYes.@0003
[0431]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@0134@0009@0017Cecilia?
You look troubled.@0003
@000CPercival...@0003
I was just wondering what will
become of Etruria after all this...@0003
@0009Just what you would think.@0003
...But I think there is only
one answer to that question.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009Etruria will regain its former glory.@0003
It will become even more prosperous
than ever before.@0003
@000C...Do you think so?@0003
@0009Of course.@0003
We will make it happen with our
own hands.@0003
@000COh...@0003
@0009You mustn't lose hope, Cecilia.@0003
If the Etrurian Generals give up,
then who will rebuild our country?@0003
@000C@0017Yes...
You're right, Percival.@0003
[0432]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@011A@0009Lord Percival, if I may have
a moment of your time...@0003
@000C@0017!@0003
Your Highness...!
Please do not address me as...@0003
@0009Hush!@0003
We do not know where enemies
may be hiding.@0003
Here, I am but a simple bard.
Understood?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
@000CThen...@0003
...What is it that you need,
Elphin?@0003
@0009@0017Prince Mildain of Etruria passed
away last year.@0003
I would appreciate if you could
inform me of the behavior of the@0003
Etrurian Courts.@0003
@000C@0017...Very well.@0003
After Prince Mildain passed away...@0003
[0433]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@011A@000C@0017Pr-...I mean, Elphin.@0003
@0009@0017What is it,
Lord Percival?@0003
@000C@0017I hear your father is still alive.
Have you seen him recently?@0003
@0009@0017No, we have not seen each
other for several years now.@0003
@000C@0017Have you no intention of
seeing him at all?@0003
@0009@0017At least not until
this war ends.@0003
@000C@0017Why?@0003
Perhaps your father is mourning for
you, thinking you are long dead.@0003
@0009@0017If I let my father know of my safety,
other people will find out as well.@0003
I may be able to make my father
happy for a moment, but he will soon@0003
suffer the grief of losing me again.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I must eliminate what is causing
that grief.@0003
Only then will I go see my father.@0003
[0434]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@011A@000C@0017Elphin.@0003
You were talking about your
songs for your future travels...@0003
@0009@0017About the state of Etruria
after the prince passed away?@0003
@000C@0017Yes.@0003
Will you be singing it in various
lands after the war ends?@0003
@0009@0017That is what I intend to do.@0003
I travel not only to sing,
but to learn as well.@0003
@000C@0017...Will you be visiting the
Etrurian palace?@0003
@0009@0017Yes, of course I will be.@0003
I expect my stay at Etruria to
be the longest.@0003
@000C@0017Where will you go after you
visit the palace?@0003
@0009@0017Nowhere...@0003
I intend to stay and sing for the
Kingdom of Etruria for as long as@0003
I live.@0003
@000C@0017...Do I have your word on that?@0003
@0009@0017...I shall swear my honor on it.@0003
[0435]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@011A@0009General Percival.@0003
@000C@0017You're...
Lalam, if I recall correctly.@0003
@0009@0017Look, look!@0003
@0009Watch me dance!@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Well?
How was it?@0003
Did it grasp you?@0003
I think this twirl really does
the trick...@0003
What do you think?@0003
@000C@0017...Are you always like that?@0003
@0009@0017Like what?@0003
@000C@0017Well...@0003
You always seem so carefree...@0003
Or rather, should I say...
disoriented?@0003
@0009@0017Aww...
Are you praising me?@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
[0436]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@011A@0009How is it this time,
General Percival?@0003
@000C@0017...Lalam.
I was wondering...@0003
Why do you always come to
show me your dancing?@0003
@0009@0017Why?@0003
@0009Don't you enjoy seeing
me dance?@0003
@000C@0017To be perfectly honest...@0003
@0009@0017Yeah?@0003
@000C@0017It is of no worth to me.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016.........No worth...@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009You...
You're so mean!@0003
@0011
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
[0437]
@000C@0010@011A@000C@0016......@0003
@000C......@0003
......@0003@0002
@000C@0017@0016...Odd...@0003
She was nothing more than a nuisance,
but now that she's gone, it seems...@0003
@0009@0010@0126@0017...Lonely?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Really?
Yes!@0003
I knew you liked having me around!@0003
@000C@0017...I didn't say that.@0003
@0009@0017Don't lie.@0003
You said it just seemed
lonely without me.@0003
@000C@0017...No,
I didn't say that.@0003
@0009@0017I knew it!@0003
Not even General Percival can live
without my dancing.@0003
All right, I'll come to you every
morning from now on and give you a@0003
wake-up dance!@0003
@000C@0017...You seem to be beyond
my comprehension.@0003
[0438]
@0009@0010@012D@000C@0010@011B@000CSophia, are you all right?@0003
@0009@0017...Oh...
Igrene...Yes...@0003
I'm fine...
I'm just a little dizzy...@0003
@000C@0017Don't stress yourself if
you're not feeling well.@0003
@0009@0017Yes...@0003
The outside world...
It's so big...@0003
I'm a little...excited...@0003
@000C@0017Well, you've never been
outside Arcadia.@0003
You can ask me anything...@0003
I know the outside world fairly well,
so I can explain things to you.@0003
@0009@0017Yes...@0003
[0439]
@0009@0010@012D@000C@0010@011B@0009@0017Igrene...@0003
@000C@0017What is it?@0003
@0009@0017Um...what is this?
I found it...on the ground...@0003
@000C@0017Let's see...@0003
Oh, this is a quarrel.@0003
@0009Qua...?@0003
@000CQuarrels are large arrows
used for ballistae.@0003
@0009@0017They can fire something...
so big....@0003
But...
It's strange...@0003
@000C@0017Strange?@0003
@0009@0017The outside people...@0003
They make such amazing weapons...and
they are much more advanced than us...@0003
But...why do they continue to fight?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016They're much...smarter than us, so...@0003
I thought they would know...that
war is pointless...@0003
...It is strange...@0003
@000CYes...@0003@0006
you're right.
It is strange...@0003
[043A]
@0009@0010@012D@000C@0010@011B@000C@0017Oh?@0003
You seem to be in a good
mood, Sophia.@0003
@0009@0017Yes...@0003
I was speaking...to the other people
in the army...@0003
The outside people...
they are all kind...@0003
@000C@0017I see...
That's nice.@0003
@0009@0017It would be nice...
if we could be friends...@0003
with the outside people...@0003
@000CYes...@0003
But the elder told us not
to speak with outsiders.@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
@000CI understand what he's saying...@0003
The Dragons' powers could easily
destroy entire countries.@0003
If the outsiders found out,
they would surely fight over it.@0003
I've seen many conflicts like
that in my life...@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
But...someday...@0003
@000CYes...@0003
If we can live together with
Dragons, there should be no@0003
reason why the outsiders can't...@0003
[043B]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@011B@000C@0017You...!@0003
@0009@0017Hm?@0003
@000C@0017Oh...!@0003
Is it...
Is it really you?@0003
@0009@0017Whoa, what the?
What's going on?@0003
I'm Astol.
Just a measly thief.@0003
@000C@0017...You look like him...@0003
You look so much like...
my husband...@0003
@0009@0017Your husband?@0003
@000C@0017I lived with my husband in Arcadia.@0003
...That is, until he suddenly left
without saying a word...@0003
@0009@0017Huh.
And he looks exactly like me?@0003
Well, they say that there are at
least 3 people on the continent@0003
with the same face.@0003
@000C@0017Wait!
Let me see your leg.@0003
@0009Hey hey,
what're you doing?@0003
@000CWhen I first met him, I found him
collapsed in the desert.@0003
The heat got to him, and he lost
memory of his past.@0003
He had blade wounds all over his body,
but he had a particularly bad injury@0003
on his leg.@0003
It never fully healed, and it left
left a scar.@0003
@0009@0017Well, I'm not your man.@0003
My legs are clean, I don't have a scary
looking scar like that on either of them.@0003
Well, I have to get going.@0003
@000C@0017Oh...@0003
[043C]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@011B@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016@0017You again?@0003
@000CAre you...
Are you really not him?@0003
@0009@0017Nope.
But hey, I can't believe this guy.@0003
He must be a real dastard to dump
such a beautiful woman like you.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017Please, let me tell you
about him.@0003
@0009@0017All right.@0003
@000C@0017As I was treating his wounds,
we started living together.@0003
We lived happily for several years.@0003
Slowly, his memory started returning
started returning to him.@0003
I was happy about it, but I was
also...scared.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016One day, bandits attacked Arcadia.@0003
My husband left to fend them off,
and never came back.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016The corpses of the bandits all sank
into the quicksand.@0003
I couldn't find my husband, so I
thought he had followed the same path.@0003
@0009Well, that must be what happened.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
I can't help thinking in the bottom of my
heart that he might be alive somewhere.@0003
@0009Ah. I see.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
If he were alive, he wouldn't just
disappear without saying anything...@0003
@0009@0017He probably wouldn't be leading such
a glamorous life anyway, even if he@0003
were alive.@0003
I say you forget about him and
move on.@0003
Hey, I know.@0003
Maybe I can give you a kiss
in place of that guy...@0003
@000C!@0003@0011
@0009Ow...@0003
Oh well...@0003
[043D]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@011B@000C@0017Oh...@0003
@0009@0017Okay, I suppose the rejected man
should slink away now...@0003
@000C@0017Wait!
Golrois...!@0003
...I mean, Astol.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Please look at this...@0003
My husband was carrying it when
I first met him.@0003
@0009@0017What are these scribbles?@0003
@000C@0017They're not scribbles.@0003
This is an emblem given to
Lycian spies.@0003
I also did some research on what
kind of work they do...@0003And...
I now understand...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Spies carry information that is
incredibly dangerous to the enemy@0003
if it is leaked.@0003
If a spy gets caught, the enemy will
dig deep down into his weaknesses.@0003
Family members and lovers are taken
as hostages...@0003
And the spy is put through endless
torture until he spills every bit of@0003
information that he has.@0003
That's why spies have to be alone...@0003
They must not make family or friends,
or lovers...@0003
@0009@0017...I'm sorry to say this to you, but...
That guy is dead.@0003
He was devoured by the quicksand of
Nabata.@0003
All this stuff about spies and whatnot...
It's just your imagination.@0003
Or perhaps you saw an illusion in the
desert heat.@0003
@000C@0016@0017......@0003
@0016I...see...@0003
Then...
I must have been dreaming...@0003
I must have had a dream of
a short period of happiness...@0003
@0009...Igrene.
...No...@0003@0002
Sorry, forget it.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0011@0006
@0009@0014Just...forget it all.
...Please.@0003 
[043E]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0122@000CHello, Marcus.@0003
@0009@0017Ah, Lady Lilina.@0003
@000CThe battle is growing bigger
all the time...@0003
Marcus, do you think Roy will
be okay?@0003
@0009Of course, my lady.@0003
Master Roy has taken after Lord Eliwood,
who was said to be the greatest knight@0003
in Lycia.@0003
@000C@0017Yes...
Mr. Eliwood was a great knight.@0003
@0009@0017Yes, my lady.
And also...@0003
Lord Eliwood's wife, she was a very
kind and gentle person.@0003
Much like yourself, I might add.@0003
@000CUh...
Do you think so?@0003
@0009Master Roy is becoming very much
like Lord Eliwood.@0003
The woman that Roy is seeking would
probably be similar to that which@0003
Lord Eliwood had found life with.@0003
@000CReally..?@0003
@0009My lady, if I may suggest.@0003
When you and Master Roy return
to Pherae, then you two could...@0003
@000C@0017Marcus!
Roy and I are friends.@0003
Just friends!
Marriage...@0003
It's too soon to be thinking
of such things!@0003
[043F]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0122@000CMarcus, what kind of couple
were Mr. Eliwood and his wife?@0003
@0009Well, my lady, when the two were
youths, that just looking at them@0003
would cheer one up.@0003
The people of Pherae were truly
happy for them.@0003
@000CWow...
That's nice...@0003
@0009Lord Eliwood loved his wife deeply.
And one night...@0003
Before the two became engaged,
Lord Eliwood suddenly disappeared@0003
from the castle.@0003
When he returned to his live three
days later, he presented her with a@0003
beautiful white flower which only
grows in the snowy highlands.@0003
It was the flower which she
loved the most.@0003
@000CMr. Eliwood is so...romantic.@0003
Sigh...@0003@0002
@0017Now look at Roy...@0003
[0440]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0122@000C@0017Phew...@0003
@0009Lady Lilina,
is something wrong?@0003
@000C@0017Marcus...
What does...@0003
What does Roy think of me?
I...@0003
I'm not so sure anymore.@0003
@0009@0016.......@0003
@000C@0016Roy, he's...@0003
I've always...liked him...
for a long time now.@0003
@0009@0017Then why not go up to him and
find out for yourself, my lady?@0003
@000CWhat...?
But...@0003
@0009I do not have much experience in matters
like this, but I have heard the maids@0003
at the castle saying that it is no
longer the age that women should be@0003
sitting around waiting.@0003
Lady Lilina, if you were to advance
on to him first, Master Roy would@0003
surely fall for you.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017Yes...
Yes.@0003
I'm the one who's known him
the longest.@0003
I can't lose to those
other girls!@0003
@0009That's the spirit,
Lady Lilina!@0003
[0441]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@0122@000CHello, Ashtor.@0003
@0009Well, if it isn't Lady Lilina.
You look as beautiful as ever.@0003
In fact, you're so beautiful you're
making my wrinkles fade away.@0003
See?@0003
@000CAshtor...you don't change, do you?@0003
My father was saying that you'd
be doing a lot better than you@0003
already are if you were more serious.@0003
@0009Well, well, guess I can't
argue with that, m'lady.@0003
@000C...Where did you first meet
my father?@0003
He never told me anything...@0003

@0009Well...@0003
It really ain't a meeting you'd
go around telling people about.@0003
@000C?@0003
@0009...I was a measly thief back then.@0003
And so I decided to creep into@0003
Castle Ostia to swipe some
treasure, see?@0003
@000CReally?@0003
@0009Yeah.@0003
@000CWhat happened?@0003
@0009Well m'lady...@0003
...Whoops, I really shouldn't be@0003
wastin' precious time here like
this...@0003
Forgive me, m'lady, but I'll
continue the story some other time..@0003
@000COh?
What a shame...@0003
[0442]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@0122@0009...It was easy getting
to the treasure.@0003
I'm an expert at picking
locks and stuff.@0003
Anyway, after I'd grabbed all
the goodies and stepped outside@0003
the treasure chamber, bam!
There he was, standing@0003
right in front of me.@0003
And wouldn't you know,
that person was...@0003
@000CMy father?@0003
@0009Lord Hector just stood there,
staring at me.@0003
He didn't seem surprised
or anything. You could tell@0003
he was somebody just by looking
at him.@0003
Me? There I was, frozen in the spot,
carryin' bags of loot over@0003
both shoulders.@0003
Would he call the guards?@0003
Would he cut me down right then
and there?@0003
And I was wondering what
was coming up next...@0003
@000CWhat? What happened?@0003
@0009He suddenly burst out
laughing, m'lady.@0003
He said, 'Quite a man to be able
to get through my castle's security@0003
so easily. What is your name?'
And I was just standing there,@0003
with my mouth hanging open.
Lord Hector then boomed, '@0003
Would you offer your skills
for the benefit of our country?'@0003
@000CWow..@0003
@0009I thought he was out
of his mind. But I knew he@0003
wasn't kidding around by looking
at his face.@0003
Anyway, I thought, to hell
with this, and I tried to@0003
bolt out the door with the treasure.@0003
And then...@0003
@000CAnd then?@0003
@0009And then from behind me,
Lord Hector...@0003
@000CWhat? What did he do?@0003
@0009He...@0003
@0017Whoops, I'm sorry m'lady,@0003
@0017I really should get goin'.
I'll continue the story@0003
@000CAgain?
Oh well...@0003
[0443]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@0122
@0009Lord Hector...
He didn't move an inch even when@0003
he saw I was making my escape.
So I ran.@0003
I was almost at the door, and Lord
Hector still stood there motionless.@0003
I didn't know what was going
on, and I turned around and@0003
yelled at him, 'I'm getting away!
You ain't gonna do anything!?'@0003
A heavy voice came back to me,
'Flee if you wish. You may keep@0003
the treasure as well.
But does that make you happy?@0003
Do you want to live your life
in the shadows in constant fear@0003@0002
of being found? Is that really
what you want?'@0003
I ran like hell, m'lady. I fled
from the castle, from his voice.@0003
After that, I just walked around
the area aimlessly through the night.@0003
Dawn broke... and I found myself
in front of the castle.@0003
@0002
Lord Hector was standing there.@0003
@000C@0016.....@0003
@0009@0016Ever since then, I've been
working for him, m'lady.@0003
He changed me.@0003
@000C@0017So that's what happened...@0003
@0009Lady Lilina, I can say this
to anyone, at any time.@0003
Your father...
was truly an honorable man.@0003
[0444]
@000C@0010@011E@0009@0010@0129@000CSo, who's next!
@0017...?@0003
Hey!@0003
Thany!@0003
@0009@0017Hey, Ward.
What's wrong?@0003
@000C@0017Don't be scurrying around
the front lines so much.@0003
@0009What!?
Scurrying around!?@0003
@000CIt's annoying when some weakling who gets
shot down so easily by a puny archer is@0003
flying around all over the place!@0003
@0009Oh yeah!?@0003
Well, it's a pain for me to have some
slow axefighter with no brains fighting@0003
near me as well!@0003
Haven't you ever heard of the
concept of dodging?@0003
@000CWhat did you say!
You pickin' a fight with me!?@0003
@0009You're the one picking the fight!@0003
@0017Well, even if we do fight, there's
no way that slow axe of yours is@0003
gonna reach me up here.@0003
@000C@0017Hey... Thany!
No fair!@0003
Get down here!@0003
@0009@0017No way!
Catch me if you can, slowpoke!@0003@0011
@000C@0017Goddammit!@0003
Why does she always have
to mess things up for me!?@0003
[0445]
@000C@0010@011E@0009@0010@0129@0009Phew...@0003
@000C@0017Little early to be relaxing,
ain't it?@0003
@0009Ow!@0003
Hey!@0003
What did you do that for?@0003
@000CThere was an enemy archer
aiming at you from the bushes.@0003
@0009What...@0003
@000CAnd here you are, taking it easy.
What an idiot.@0003
@0009Idiot?
Who's an idiot!@0003
@000CSomeone who just decides to relax during
a battle seems like an idiot to me.@0003
You're just lucky I happened to
pass by.@0003
If not, you would've been a goner
by now.@0003
@0009What?!@0003
Hmph, I could easily have taken care
of a single archer.@0003
@0017You didn't have to put me in your
debt by saving me like that.@0003
@000C@0017Oh, is that so!@0003
Well excuse me!@0003
Fine then, I'll just be watching
From now on.@0003
Good luck!@0003@0011
@0009That idiot!@0003
I couldn't thank him...@0003
[0446]
@000C@0010@011E@0009@0010@0129@000C@0017Where did she go?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, it's Ward.@0003
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0017I told you to leave this part up
to me.@0003
That doesn't mean you just go flying
off on your own!@0003
We have to listen to the leader's
orders...@0003
@0009But if we sit around waiting for
orders, we could miss a big chance!@0003
@000CDon't you get it?!@0003
What if you just dashed out on your
own into a bunch of enemy archers!@0003
How come we always have to have people
like you who just don't think before@0003
they act...@0003
@0009?@0003
I thought you were angry about
me flying off on my own.@0003
@000COf course I am!@0003
We need to work as a team in battle...@0003
@0009Then what was all that about
the archers and stuff?@0003
@000C!!@0003
T-That was...@0003
@0009@0017...Were you worried about me?@0003
@000C@0017W-W-What are you talking about!@0003
N-N-No way!@0003
I-I was just telling you how we
should act in battle...@0003
@0009Ward, you're tripping over your words.@0003
@000CErg...@0003
@0009@0017Hey, Ward.@0003
@000C@0017What?@0003
@0009@0017Thanks.@0003
@000C@0017...Gimme a break.@0003
That's not like you at all.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah...you're right.@0003
[0447]
@0009@0010@011E@000C@0010@011F@0009@0017All right, who's next!
Bring it on!@0003
@000C@0017Ward, can't you calm down
a bit?@0003
@0009@0017Eh?
What's that?@0003
You scared, Lot?@0003
@000CAs if!@0003
@0009@0017Well then, we're fine, right?@0003
I go charging in, and you cover up
the small parts for me.@0003
We've been doing great like that
all this time.@0003
@000CWell yeah, but...@0003
@0009But what?@0003
@000CMary asked me to take care
of you.@0003
@0009Sis said that?@0003
Geez, I'm not a kid anymore..@0003
@000CI hope you're right.@0003
@0009Did you say something?@0003
@000CNo, nothing.@0003
[0448]
@0009@0010@011E@000C@0010@011F@000CWard, you seem to be doing
well today.@0003
@0009Of course!@0003
I'm always doing great.@0003
You better do well, too, you know.@0003
You gotta make money to buy medicine
for your mother...@0003
@000C...That's all right, now.@0003
@0009Huh?@0003
What do you mean?@0003
@000CMom, she...@0003
She didn't make it.@0003
@0009@0017What?!@0003
Why didn't you tell me?@0003
@000C@0017If I told you, you'd be yelling at
me to go home to Myu, right?@0003
@0009@0017What do you think!
Myu's all alone now.@0003
Don't you care about your
own sister?@0003
@000C@0017But that was during a job.
I couldn't pass it up.@0003
@0009...Lot?@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009You're more stupid than I thought.@0003
@000C...Maybe so.@0003
[0449]
@0009@0010@011E@000C@0010@011F@000CWard, you're acting strange lately.@0003
You got something to say to me?@0003
@0009...Lot.@0003
@000CYeah?@0003
@0009Don't die.@0003
You better not die.@0003
@000CWhat the...@0003
@0009If you were killed,
what would happen to Myu?@0003
She's still just a little girl, and
she'll be forced to live on her own.@0003
@000CBut you're the same.@0003
If you were killed, Mary
would be upset.@0003
@0009Oh, sure, like that bitch
is gonna get upset over me.@0003
@000C...You really don't
feel that way.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016It's not that 'I' won't die.
'We' won't die.@0003
Eventually, we'll go home,
back to our hometown.@0003
@0009...It's just a rundown village
with dirty rivers and no green at all.@0003
@000CBut it's our hometown, and
there are people waiting for us there.@0003
@0009Yeah, you're right.@0003
[044A]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@011E@0009Hey, you're from the
Western Isles, aren't you?@0003
@000C@0017.....
How did you know?@0003
@0009@0017I can tell by your face.@0003
@000C@0017Really?
Something tells me otherwise...@0003
@0009@0017Are you going back to your
hometown after the war?@0003
If you are, I could use your help.
@000C@0017Help doing what?@0003
@0009@0017Now you're talking.
You see...@0003
I have a plan to build a new village
on the Western Isles for those people@0003
who lost their homes in the war.@0003
I was wondering if you could
help out.@0003
@000C@0017What do you me to do?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, lots of things.@0003
Chopping firewood, laundry, cooking..@0003
@000C@0017...I'm not a servant, you know.@0003
I'm going to live as a mercenary.@0003
Sorry, but could you ask someone
else...@0003
@0009@0017So that means you'll help
us out.@0003
I knew just by looking at your
eyes that you'd understand...@0003
@000C@0017Wait, that's not what I said!@0003
Don't put words in my mouth!@0003
@0009@0017...Don't lie to yourself.
You know you want to.@0003
@000C@0017Right, I know I don't want to!@0003
@0009@0017Come on, your eyes are saying
that you want to help.@0003
@000C@0017No they're not!@0003
[044B]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@011E@0009Hey.@0003
@000C@0017You again...@0003
I'm not helping, all right?@0003
@0009@0017Trust me, you don't want to
be a mercenary.@0003
You never know when you're going
to die.@0003
And besides, you're weak.@0003
@000C@0017Erg...
You'll regret saying that...@0003
You don't want to piss me off.@0003
@0009Oh?@0003
@000CWhat are you looking at
me like that for!@0003
I once killed monsters stronger
than any human, you know!@0003
@0009Wow, now that's something.@0003
What kind of beast was it?@0003
@000C...Near my village...
there's this weird cave.@0003
When I was a kid, there were rumors
rumors that the cave was filled@0003
with strange creatures.@0003
So one day I took Lot and went to
defeat them.@0003
@0009Yeah?@0003
@000CThe inside of the cave was damp...@0003
I could tell something wasn't right.@0003
Lot was scared, but I was fine.@0003
I led the way...and suddenly,
there they were.@0003
The monsters were crawling all
over the cave floor.@0003
Long, skinny bodies writhing around,
and they were all scaly and spotted..@0003
@0009@0017Snakes?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017Well, I guess they did look like snakes.
But these were no ordinary snakes.@0003
They're real monsters, with poison
and strange dances and weird moves..@0003
@0009@0017Yeah...I guess.
Where is this cave?@0003
@000C@0017... What?@0003
@0009@0017I'll go check it out on the way
way to the village site.@0003
I'm kind of curious about it now.@0003
@000C@0017B-But I already killed all
the monsters, so..@0003
@0009@0017You said they were all over
the cave floor.@0003
One might have escaped.
They're no ordinary snakes, right?@0003
I really want to see them.@0003
@000C@0017Erg...@0003
[044C]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@011E@0009Well, we meet again.@0003
Well?@0003
Doesn't looking at my face make you
want to help out?@0003
@000C@0017No.@0003
@0017...But...@0003
When this war is over, it might be
a good idea to go back to my@0003
hometown.@0003
If I get bored, I might drop by
and help.@0003
@0009Do you have family back home?@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0017Yeah, I have an older sister
who's always yelling at me.@0003
@0009...Sigh...@0003
You're pretty stupid,
aren't you?@0003
@000CStupid?@0003
What do you mean by stupid...@0003
@0009@0017You've got a home to return to.@0003
You've got someone waiting for you.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016You can help us out if you want,
but you must go back home to@0003
your sister.@0003
Got it?@0003
@000C@0017Y-Yeah, you don't have to tell me...
Damn...older sister now...@0003
[044D]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@0129@0009@0017Thany, don't come out front
that often.@0003
Pegasi are prey to archer.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I know.@0003
@0009@0017And you're frail, so make sure
you retreat if it gets dangerous.@0003
@000C@0017Uh-huh.@0003
@0009@0017And...@0003
@000CLot!
You're such a worrier.@0003
I am a knight, you know.@0003
@0009But you're still a knight
in training.@0003
@000CWell yeah, but...@0003
@0009Then remember that you can
never be overly cautious in battle.@0003
The best way to stay alive
is to always be wary.@0003
@000C... Yes, sir.@0003
[044E]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@0129@0009Thany, why do you always
go charging in like that?@0003
@000CBut Lot...@0003
@0009No buts.
You know, you should be more...@0003
@000C...Lot?@0003
@0009?@0003
@000CHow come you're always so
concerned about me?@0003
Oh wait, I get it.@0003
Aww, I never knew you felt that
way about me!@0003
@0009Yeah, you wish.@0003
@000CThen why?@0003
@0009...I have a little sister back home.@0003
@000CSister?@0003
Does she look like me or something?@0003
@0009No, not at all.@0003
@000CThen...@0003
@0009She's alot younger than you.
She isn't even 10 years old.@0003
So I get real worried when I'm
out here like this...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Thany, you've got an
older sister, right?@0003
@000CYeah, not just one, but two.@0003
@0009Then take care of yourself,
for your sister's sakes.@0003
Imagine how they'd feel
if something happened to you.@0003
@000CYeah...you're right.
I'll be more careful.@0003
[044F]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@0129@000CHey, Lot!@0003
@0009@0017Thany.@0003
You seem to be doing well lately.@0003
@000C@0017See?@0003
I'm being more careful now,
right?@0003
I'm not just rushing in anymore.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah, compared to before.@0003
@000CShoot, just 'compared to
before', huh...@0003
@0017Oh yeah, I had something
to tell you, too.@0003
@0009@0017Something to tell me?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah.@0003
The things that you should be
careful of in battle!@0003
Do you want to hear them?@0003
@0009@0017Well, yeah.@0003
@000C@0017Then give me your ear
for a sec.@0003
@0009@0017Okay...
Like this?@0003
@000C@0017...@0003
Don't stress yourself
too much, big brother.@0003
@0009@0017What the...!@0003
@000C@0017And that was from Lot's cute
little sister!@0003
@0009@0017Hey!@0003
Thany!@0003
@000C@0017Hahahaha!@0003
[0450]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@011F@0009Hey, you're from the
Western Isles, right?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah...
How did you know?@0003
@0009@0017Easy, your face.@0003
All the men from that area
have features like that.@0003
@000C@0017...They do?@0003
@0009@0017Are you going back home
after the war?@0003
If you are,
I could use your help.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah?@0003
@0009@0017I'm planning on building a new
village in the Western Isles.@0003
It'll be for people who lost
their homes during the war.@0003
I want you to help build it.@0003
@000C@0017All right,
I'll do what I can...@0003
@0009@0017Really?
Thanks.@0003
@000C@0017But I can't promise.@0003
I can only help if I'm still
alive when the war ends.@0003
@0009Saying things like that already?@0003
@000CI'm just saying it because
it's entirely possible.@0003
I can't be making empty promises
If I don't know whether I'll@0003
survive or not...@0003
@0009@0017You're such a worrier
for someone so young.@0003
You'll be getting gray hairs
before you're thirty at that rate.@0003
@000C@0017...I will?@0003
[0451]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@011F@0009Hey, it's you again.@0003
@000C@0017You're the one who wanted
to build the village...@0003
@0009Right,
the plan's coming along smoothly.@0003
A free village,
open to anybody...@0003
That's my dream.@0003
@000C@0017Do you have the money to build it?@0003
@0009@0017...Well, we're suddenly getting
realistic.@0003
You see...
I actually don't know.@0003
But I know of the mines in the
Western Isles, so I'm planning on@0003
going in and hitting a jackpot.@0003
@000C@0017That seems pretty unrealistic to me...
...Oh, wait.@0003
I know of an old, deserted mine.@0003
@0009@0017Really?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I went there with Ward
when I was a kid.@0003
There were rumors that the place
was haunted, so nobody went near it.@0003
@0009I see.@0003
@000CWard seemed really scared,
he probably believed the rumors.@0003
We went in a little, and suddenly
Ward screamed and started running@0003
toward the entrance.@0003
So I followed him out.@0003
@0009Was there something in there?@0003
@000CYeah, snakes.@0003
Lots of them.@0003
They covered the whole cave floor.@0003
I was trying to figure out why
there were snakes in there...@0003
But anyway, the mine was
closed because of them.@0003
@0009@0017I see...@0003
So there might still be some
gold left in there.@0003
Sounds interesting.@0003
We might be able to get the money
for the village there.@0003
Say, can you take me there when
you get the chance?@0003
@000C@0017I don't mind...
But it'll be dangerous.@0003
@0009@0017Oh, that won't be a problem.@0003
You'll be there to protect me.@0003
@000C@0017...Me?@0003
[0452]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@011F@0009Hey, how are you doing?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I'm still alive.@0003
@0009@0017Don't you die.
I'm counting on you to survive.@0003
@000C@0017I don't plan on dying.
I have a sister back home.@0003
And also...@0003@0009@0017Also what?@0003
@000C@0017No, nothing.@0003
@0009@0017Oh, I get it.@0003
You've got a special somebody
waiting for you, eh?@0003
Well, well aren't you the lucky
man.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017Anyway, I'm planning on going home soon,
granted that I stay alive...@0003
@0009@0017Are you worrying about that again?@0003
@000C@0017The enemy is getting stronger
all the time.@0003
I don't know how much longer I
hold out.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I know that we'll win in the end...@0003
But I don't know whether I'll be
able to go home.@0003
@0009Come on,
don't be so stupid.@0003
@000C...I'm stupid?@0003
@0009Someone of your age should be
enjoying life!@0003
I know you're probably worrying about
your sister and all sorts of things.@0003
But you have to go running around
more freely.@0003
You'll probably run into walls and
hit your head from time to time,@0003
but that's life.@0003
@000C...I don't think I want to be
hitting my head.@0003
@0009Don't worry, even if you die,
I'll take care of things for you.@0003
@0017So you can go out and get
killed without any worries!@0003
...You know?@0003@0011
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016She seemed to be saying something
different than what she was originally@0003
talking about...@0003
But...was she trying to cheer me up?@0003
[0453]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012F@0009@0017So...you're Gonzales.@0003
I hear you've been doing
many evil deeds in the West.@0003
@000CUh...@0003
@0009What do you want from me?@0003
@000CI...@0003
I want to fight with everyone.@0003
But...I useless.@0003
I become strong, everyone like me.@0003
Make me strong.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
Very well, I shall train you.@0003
First, I want you to hit me
as hard as you can.@0003
@000CHit?@0003
I can't...@0003
You get hurt...@0003
@0009You...@0003
Idiot!@0003
@0009@0080@000C@000CGah.@0080@0011@0011@0003
@000C@0010@012FWh-Why you hit me?@0003
@000ADid you really think that your
puny fists would hurt me!?@0003
Now hit me!@0003
@000CO-Okay...@0003
Raaah!@0003

[0454]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012F@0009@0017Gonzales.@0003
Are you continuing with your training?@0003
@000CLook, look.
I found this.@0003
I have more money.@0003
@0009I see.
And?@0003
@000CI become strong.
I buy armor.@0003
I not get hurt.@0003
@0009You...@0003
Idiot!@0003
@0009@0080@000C@000CGah.@0080@0011@0011@0003
@000AListen!@0003
Offense is everything in a battle!@0003
If you kill the enemy in a single
hit, they will never get a chance@0003
to hit you!@0003
Know that only weaklings wear armor!@0003
@000C@0010@012FO-Okay...
I was wrong.@0003
I kill enemy in one hit.@0003
I buy strong axe.@0003
@000AYou...@0003
Idiot!@0003
@000CGeh.@0080@0011@0011@0003
@000ASo you think a strong weapon
makes you powerful, do you?@0003
A true warrior fights with
the raw strength of his muscles!@0003
If you have the time to go buy
weapons, train yourself instead!@0003
Train yourself to the point where
you and break down walls with the@0003
swing of an iron axe!@0003
@000C@0010@012FO-Okay...@0003
[0455]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012F@0009@0017Ah, Gonzales.@0003
@000CI...@0003
@0009Say nothing, Gonzales.@0003
I can tell by looking in your eyes.@0003
You have become strong.@0003
You have come a long way.@0003
@000CI, I...@0003
@0009I know what you want to say,
Gonzales.@0003
And I completely agree with you.@0003
I'm happy that you have come
this far.@0003
@000CI...@0003
@0009But it isn't over yet.@0003
The path to a true warrior is long
and hard.@0003
Now come, Gonzales.@0003
Let us go in search of further power!@0003
@000CI...@0003
[0456]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012A@0009@0017Hmph...@0003
So this is a wyvern.
It has a forbidding face.@0003
@000C@0017You are...
Bartre.@0003
@0009@0017Yes.@0003
Young man, do you mind if I
touch it?@0003
@000CWell, maybe not now...@0003
@0009Hm...?
Hmm!?@0003
Why you...@0003
You want to fight me,
do you!?@0003
@000CRubley,
stop!@0003
@0009......@0003
@000C@0017I'm sorry, he's on his toes
since we were training...@0003
Are you hurt?@0003
@0009@0017No, I'm fine.@0003
Say, young man, you have quite some
talent.@0003
You've tamed this beast at your
young age.@0003
@000C@0017No, any Dragon Knight can do
this much...@0003
@0009@0017Don't belittle yourself like that.
I can tell you have talent.@0003
@0009Ah, yes, you said
you were training?@0003
@000CYes, I've been trying to get some
speed in our offense.@0003
@0009Hm, you're already a powerful Dragon
Knight, but you seek to become@0003
even stronger?
Now that's a real man.@0003
I wish you luck.@0003
[0457]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012A@0009@0017Ah, young man.@0003
Have you been continuing
your training?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
@0009Yes, very good.
Men must always be strong in body.@0003
You know, the men these days
are getting softer and softer.@0003
Why, in battles I see grown
men lagging behind the women!@0003
Disgraceful.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
We must become stronger, as well.@0003
@0009Yes, I agree...@0003
You see, my daughter left home recently,
and I've been wondering that maybe I@0003
didn't enforce enough discipline on
her as a father...@0003
It's been bothering me for several
days now.@0003
@000CI, uh...
I'm sorry to hear that.@0003
@0009Ah, it's always good to talk
with someone who understands!@0003
[0458]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012A@0009@0017Zeiss.@0003
@000CYes?@0003
@0009It seems we get along well.@0003
I feel I can bring out my true
strength when I'm fighting@0003
alongside you.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I can also fight without worry
with you around.@0003
It's like...something big is
protecting me.@0003
@0009@0017Hm, if I were to have a son, I would
have raised him into a fine young@0003
man like you.@0003
You are indeed the perfect match
for my daughter.@0003
@000C@0017Uh...
Thank you.@0003
@0009@0017From now on, think of me as your father
and feel free to tell me anything.@0003
Is that clear, son?@0003
@000CUh, yeah...
Thank you very much.@0003
[0459]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012C
@0009@0017Hm?
Who are you?@0003
@000C@0017Hi, I'm Cass!@0003
Hey, Bartre,@0003
can we talk for a bit?@0003@0009@0017Sure,
I don't mind.@0003
@000C@0017Thanks.@0003
You look a lot like my father,
you know.@0003
@0009@0017I do?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah.
But he didn't act like you,@0003
though. He was nothing
but a coward.@0003
@0009@0017I see.@0003
@000C@0017But talking to you
reminds me of him.@0003
@000C@0017Hey, Bartre,
can you hug me like@0003
my father used to?@0003@0009Well, all right.
Like this?@0003
@000C@0017Thanks, Bartre.@0003
@0009@0017Sure.@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0011@0007
@000C@0010@012CHeh...@0017What an idiot.@0003
@0017Just like my father.@0003
[045A]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012C
@000C@0017...Bartre.@0003
Here.@0003
@0009Hm...?@0003
This is my axe.@0003
@000CYeah. And you see this@0003
other stuff? They're all yours.
I stole them from you@0003
the other day.@0003
@0009Well...@0003
@000CYup, I'm a thief.@0003
I trick people and
steal their stuff. Well?@0003
Aren't you going to yell at me?@0003
@0009@0016...Cath.@0003
@0016Why are you telling me this?@0003
You could have gotten away
with it, if you kept silent.@0003
@000C...Yeah.@0003
I don't even know why I stole
from you in the first place.@0003
I usually only steal from
the rich.@0003
@0009Does it have something
to do with your father?@0003
@000C...Maybe.@0003
I've always hated my father.
He was such a coward...@0003
I always hated him.@0003
[045B]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012C
@000C@0017...Our village was burned to
the ground in the war.@0003
A bunch of soldiers came and
ordered us to set our houses on fire.@0003
No one did... I mean, who would?
It was our home. Soon the@0003
soldiers got impatient and drew
their swords... That's when one@0003
of the villagers took a torch
and went around setting the@0003
place on fire. That coward...
was my father.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016All of our houses and
crops were burned... And even@0003
then, all my father did was
stand there and watch. ...@0003
I've hated him ever since.
I swore to myself that I@0003
would never become a coward
who goes around bowing to@0003
power like that. That's why I...@0003
@0009Cath... you're wrong.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009No one would enjoy burning
down their own village.@0003
But your father... he had
something he needed to protect.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Your father didn't have the
strength to defeat the soldiers.@0003
But he was fighting all the same.
He was gritting his teeth and@0003
fighting to protect something@0003
that was more important than
his house and crops. ...@0003
He was fighting to protect you.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016...... Ha...@0003
I don't think so.
My father's just a coward.@0003
@0017He's nothing like you.@0003
But... I suppose I could think
of it that way...@0003
[045C]
@000C@0010@0121@000CRay!
Ray!@0003
@0017I said,
Ray!@0003
@0009@0010@0125... I can hear you, you don't
have to shout like that.@0003
... What do you want?@0003
@000C@0017Here.@0003
That's your share.@0003
@0009@0017?@0003
What are these?@0003
@000C@0017Baked tarts, as you can see.@0003
The meal delivery man gave me some
extra ones.@0003
They look good, don't they?@0003
@0009@0017... Sweets...@0003
They're hard to get nowadays.@0003
You should savor them and
eat them for yourself.@0003
@000CThey won't be good even
@0017if I eat them alone.@0003
So let's eat them later today.@0003
Anyway, I'll be going now.@0003@0011
@0006@000C@0010@0121
Oh, one more thing.@0003
You should at least respond when
you're spoken to!@0003
With me, it's fine, but you shouldn't
act like that with strangers.@0003
People are going to misjudge you as
antisocial or something.@0003@0011
@0009@0017Misjudge, huh?@0003
...Yeah, whatever.@0003
My good ol' brother seems to be
as naive as ever.@0003
[045D]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0121@000C@0017Ray!@0003
@0009...What?@0003
@000C@0017I was just wondering if you're
doing alright.@0003
@0009@0017What do you mean,
all right?@0003
@000CI was worried if you were
still here or not.@0003
You know... the first time you left,
you just left a note and suddenly@0003
disappeared.@0003
I was worried that you might just walk
off again without saying anything...@0003
@0009... Lugh.@0003
@000CYour note said, 'I want to train my
Dark Magic skills on my own.@0003
Was... I in the way?
You didn't want me around...?@0003
@0009N-No, that's not the case...@0003
I was planning on going back home
once I gained enough power as a@0003
Shaman.@0003
@000C@0017Ray!
I knew it!@0003
I knew you were going to return
to pick up the little ones!@0003
@0009@0017Huh?
No, I never...@0003
@000C@0017I'm so relieved!@0003
You haven't changed at all, you're still
the kind-hearted Ray that I know.@0003
I'll go pray!@0003
I'm going to thank God for letting me
see you again!@0003
@0011
@0009@0017Um... hello?@0003
...Sigh...
Why is he like that?@0003
[045E]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0121@0009@0017Lugh, I need to tell you
something.@0003
@000C@0017What is it, Ray?@0003
@0009@0017I... I'm sorry I left the orphanage
without saying anything.@0003
I... Uh...
I'll apologize for that...@0003
@000C@0017No, it's all right now.@0003
I understand.@0003
@0009@0017A-And!@0003
I'll never disappear without
warning again!@0003
@000C@0017Yeah?@0003
@0009@0017So will you stop hovering
around me all the time?@0003
Come on, please!!@0003
@000C...Is there a problem if
I'm near you?@0003
@0009Er...@0003
N-No, that's not the case,
but...@0003
@000C@0017Then what's the problem?@0003
We never know how often we'll be
together once we grow up.@0003
@0009@0017... Lugh?@0003
@000C@0017If...@0003
If I don't make it through this war,
promise me you'll pick up the little@0003
ones at the Elimine Church.@0003
@0009@0017Don't say that.
We'll both survive.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah... you're right.@0003
Something's wrong with me today.@0003
@0009@0017I won't let you die.@0003
You're my brother, my only
brother.@0003
@000C@0017Thanks, Ray.@0003
[045F]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0121@0009Oh...@0003
H-Hey@0003
You're Lugh, right?@0003
I, uh, I'm sorry for mistaking you
for your brother the other day...@0003
@000CNo, Hugh, it's all right.@0003
We're twins, so no one can really
tell us apart anyway.@0003
@0009Oh man, thanks for forgiving me.@0003
I can't believe I just got pissed and
grabbed a kid by the collar like that.@0003
I'm a terrible man.@0003
@000C...But originally it's Ray's fault
for walking off with your spell book.@0003
Then I have to apologize too.@0003
@0009No, never mind that.@0003
That was partly my fault for
being off-guard.@0003
@000CBut... ...@0003
Yeah, you're right, never mind.@0003
We got to meet each other because
of it.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah!@0003
We're both magi, so let's help
each other along!@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I was hoping that you would
teach me some things.@0003
[0460]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0121@000C@0017Hugh!@0003
Are you all right?@0003
@0009@0017Huh?@0003
What do you mean, all right?@0003
@000C@0017You're bleeding from your
elbow!@0003
We have to stop it...@0003@0009@0017Oh, I got hit in that
last fight.@0003
Don't worry about it, it's
not such a big deal.@0003
@000C@0017Yes it is!@0003
You're not just going to leave
such a bad wound alone..@0003
@0009Lugh?
You look a little pale, too...@0003
@000C...I've suffered enough times already
from losing people close to me.@0003
...I will treat that wound.@0003
@0009......
All right, thanks.@0003
[0461]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0121@0009@0017Lugh, about the other day...@0003
@000CI'm sorry!@0003
You said you were all right, but I
just ignored you and... I'm sure you@0003
didn't like a kid being so arrogant...@0003
@0009Idiot, why are you apologizing
after helping me?@0003
@000CBut you seemed to have been avoiding
me after that, so I thought that maybe@0003
you were mad...@0003
@0009...I was embarrassed, what do
you think!@0003
@000CWhat?
Why?@0003
@0009Because...@0003
No one ever cared for me that much in
my whole life...@0003
My grandma was the one who raised me,
but she was one hell of a bitch.@0003
I've gotten injuries far worse than
this one, but she wouldn't use her@0003
@0017staves to heal me at all!@0003
I was just so happy that you
seemed to be so concerned..@0003
Lugh, thanks, man.@0003
You're now my friend forever.@0003@000COf course, Hugh!
Let's be friends forever!!@0003
[0462]
@000C@0010@012E
Phew... Sorry I'm straining you
so much, Trifinne... Good girl.@0003
@0009@0010@0121Wow!@0003
A wyvern!@0003
Wow, it's so big!@0003
Is this wyvern yours?@0003
Will it get angry if I touch it?@0003
@000CNo, go ahead.
She's a gentle one.@0003
@0009Then...@0003
Wow, such hard scales...
Her fangs are sharp too!@0003
Wow... are you a Dragon Knight?@0003
@000CYes, yes I am.@0003
@0009Really!?@0003
I thought only Bern had Dragon
Knights!@0003
@000C@0017!@0003
@0009@0017They say Bern's Dragon Knights are
invincible, so I was a little worried...@0003
But they'll be nothing if we have
Dragon Knights as well!@0003
I want to defeat Bern, but I'm still
not very good with my magic, so I'm@0003
so I'm still not of much use yet...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Oh... I better get going.
See you later!@0003
Thanks for letting me
pet your wyvern.@0003
@000C@0017Yes...see you...@0003
[0463]
@000C@0010@012E@0009@0010@0121@0009Hello!@0003
Can I give this to your wyvern?@0003
@000C...Hello.
What is that?@0003
@0009I got some extra baked tarts, so I
wanted to give some to the wyvern@0003
as well.@0003
Oh wait, maybe wyverns don't eat
food like this?@0003
@000CYou love them, right Trifinne?
Thank you, Lugh.@0003
@0009She's called Trifinne?
Can I call her that, too?@0003
@000COf course.@0003
@0009Here you go, Triffine.
Eat up.@0003
Good, isn't it?@0003
@000C...What is your name?@0003
@0009Me?@0003
I'm Lugh, from Lycia.
What's your name?@0003
Where are you from?@0003
@000CI'm Miledy.
...I come from Bern.@0003
@0009!!!@0006
...You're joking, right?@0003
@000C...I'm sorry.
I couldn't get myself to say it...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0011
@000C@0016@0017Wait!
Lugh!@0003@0007@0002
@0017...I know it couldn't be avoided,
but still...@0003
I'm sorry, Trifinne, just when you
had made a cute friend...@0003
[0464]
@000C@0010@012E@0009@0010@0121@0009Hello, Miss Miledy.@0003
@000C@0017Lugh!@0003
@0009...I'm sorry I ran off
like that the other day.@0003
@000C@0017No, it's all right.@0003
I'm glad you're speaking to
me again.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
I didn't want things to end like
that.@0003
@0017...Will you listen to my story?@0003
@000COf course.@0003
@0009My parents died when I was four, and
ever since then I've been living at an@0003
orphanage in Lycia.@0003
It was a tiny orphanage, with seven
kids and just one priest whom we@0003
called Father.@0003
The oldest kids were my twin brother
Ray, and another boy called Chad, and@0003
me, so we three would take care of
the little ones.@0003
We were poor, but we were still
happy.@0003
But ever since Bern started the war,
our lives changed.@0003
Food started getting scarce, and we
sometimes had to resort to begging...@0003
Chad... he started stealing food without
telling Father...@0003
Ray then got fed up with that lifestyle
and suddenly left one day without@0003
telling anybody.@0003
I... We hated Bern.@0003
Bern was the one that did this to us...
Bern killed Father...@0003
I just wanted Bern to disappear.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016That's what I kept telling myself.@0003
..Anger keeps you going more than
sorrow...@0003
Anger has kept me alive... so that I would
be able to protect the little ones...@0003
...Phew...@0003
So...for now, until this war ends...
I have to keep my anger towards Bern.@0003
...But, you're on our side, right?
I don't have to hate you...@0003
Right?@0003
@000C@0017I would be so relieved if
you didn't hate me, Lugh.@0003
If you would let me, I want to
help you as your friend... Lugh.@0003
@0009Thank you, Miss Miledy.@0003
[0465]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@012F@000C@0017Li... lina.
Lilina.@0003
@0009@0017Yes?@0003
@000C@0017This.@0003
I give you.@0003
@0009@0017Oh... A pretty white flower.
Thank you, Gonzales.@0003
@000C@0017Th... Thank...?
What's that?@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
@000C@0017I dumb...
I not remember lots of words...@0003
@0009@0017Oh...
It's thank you.@0003
It's an expression of gratitude.@0003
@000C@0017Grat...?@0003
@0009@0017Um...@0003
When someone does something for you
and you feel happy, you say@0003
'Thank you.'@0003
@000C@0017Thank... you?@0003
@0009@0017That's right...
Thank you.@0003
[0466]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@012F@000CL-Lilina, Lilina.
Thank...you...@0003
@0009Gonzales, it's not a greeting
word, you know.@0003
@000CThis, I give you.@0003
You pretty.@0003
Flower pretty.
Look good on you...@0003
@0009Thank you very much,
Gonzales.@0003
@000C@0017Thank you...@0003
@0009@0017This is really a beautiful flower...@0003
They were growing in Roy's homeland,
too.@000C@0017Roy?
Who's Roy?@0003
@0009@0017Roy is this army's leader.@0003
He's not very strong, but...@0003
He's very kind.@0003
@000C@0017...Lilina like Roy?@0003
@0009@0017Hm...?@0003
Yes...
Yes, I like him very much.@0003
@000C@0017@0016......@0016@0003
...I go now.@0003
@0009What?
Wait, Gonzales...@0003
[0467]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@012F@0009@0017Wait!
Gonzales!@0003
What's wrong?@0003
Why are you avoiding me?@0003
@000CSh... Shut up!@0003
@0009Ah!@0003
@000CG-Go away!
Go go go!@0003@0011
@0009@0016......@0003@0011@0007
@000C@0010@012F@0016Only hurt if talk...
I know...@0003
I ugly, you pretty...
I not same as you.@0003
But...I never forget.
I stay human thanks to you...@0003
I never forget.@0003@0002
...Thank you...@0003@0007
@0009@0010@0122...No.@0003
@000CLi...lina?@0003
@0009That word...
You use it when you are happy.@0003
You don't use it when
you're... leaving someone.@0003
@000CLilina...
Crying?@0003
@0009You too...
Why are you crying?@0003
@000CI...
I...@0003
@0009Gonzales...
I want to be with you.@0003
@000CLilina...@0003
@0009Don't tell me to go away...
Please...@0003
@000CLilina...
I...I...@0003
@0009Gonzales...@0003
@000CUhhh...@0003
[0468]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0123@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009@0017Hm...?@0003
Do I see someone so foolish as to walk
by me without saying a word?@0003
Whoever it is, he seems to have a
death wish.@0003
@000C@0017O-Oh!
H-Hey, Grandma!@0003
What a coincidence!@0003
@0009@0017Don't give me that rubbish!@0003
Hiding as soon as you see me,
are you?@0003
You seem to be as shy as always.@0003
@000C@0017Well, Grandma, you seem to
be all strong and healthy...@0003
You don't plan on dying any
time soon, do you?@0003
@0009@0017Hmph!@0003
I can't be dropping dead leaving a
pathetic grandson like you on his own.@0003
And?@0003
It's been three years sent I sent you
out to study dark magic.@0003
I hope you have a good excuse for that
stench of anima magic that you're@0003
surrounding yourself with.@0003
@000C@0017Well, I became a mage.@0003
@0009@0017...Am I finally losing my hearing?
I thought I heard you say 'mage.'@0003
@000C@0017I said, I became an
anima magic user!@0003
@0009@0017You... pathetic idiot!@0003
And you dare show your face
in front of me!?@0003
@000C@0017Help!
Murder!@0003
@0009@0017Idiot...@0003
@000C@0017Hey, where are you going,
Grandma?@0003
@0009@0017I'm going insane talking to you.@0003
You better not show me that pathetic
face of yours for a long time.@0003@0011
@000C@0017...I thought she was going to beat
me to a pulp.@0003
Well, either she's gotten old, or she was
just stunned at how handsome I've become.@0003
Either way, lucky me!@0003
[0469]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0123@0009Hugh!@0003
@000C@0017Grandma!@0005
@0016......@0016@0003
@0009...What are you doing?@0003
@000CHuh?@0003
Oh, I'm just bracing myself so I'll be
prepared to run when you blast me with@0003
your magic.@0003
@0009...You really are an idiot.@0003
@000CWhat do you mean, an idiot?
Come on, I'm your only grandson!@0003
@0009Yes, unfortunately you are.
Well, there's no point in crying
over spilled milk.@0003
Anyway, I need something from you.@0003
@000C@0017Really?@0003
That's a surprise.@0003
@0009@0017Give me back that Resire book
I gave you when I sent you out.@0003
You don't need it anymore.@0003
@000C@0016Ulp...@0016@0003
@0009You do have it... do you?@0003
@000C@0016Erg...@0016@0003
@0009Hugh, those books are hard to get!@0003
If you're telling me you sold it
or something...@0003
@000CWait!
No no no!@0003
I didn't sell it!@0003
I gave it away!@0003
@0009What!?
Can't you think of a better excuse?@0003
@000CIt's not an excuse!@0003
I met this kid who was studying dark
magic, and we traveled together for@0003
a while.@0003
I found out that the kid was an orphan,
so I kinda felt sympathetic, I guess.@0003
Anyway, one morning when I woke up,
the kid was gone, and so was the@0003
spell book!@0003
@0009So you didn't give it away, but
you got it stolen by a child.@0003
@000CI guess you could put it
that way, too.@0003
@0009That's the only way to
put it!@0003
@000C......
Hey, Grandma.@0003
I can leave you alone if
your head hurts.@0003
@0009...Yes.@0003
I wouldn't be able to face your
deceased parents if I let my anger@0003
get to me and blast you to
smithereens.@0003
@000C!!@0003
S-See ya!@0003@0011
@0009He's just like his father...@0003
He tries to be bad, but he can't
deny his kind heart.@0003
Why couldn't he inherit his
talent for dark magic as well?@0003
[046A]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0123@000C@0017Grandma!@0003
@0009What.@0003
@000CWas my old man good at dark magic?
I don't really remember.@0003
@0009...Why?@0003
@000CWell, I was trying to study dark
magic at first, but I couldn't@0003
seem to pick it up at all, while
that kid I was talking about was@0003
doing great just learning on his own.@0003
So I thought maybe I didn't have
the talent, so I just switched to@0003
anima magic.@0003
But the thing is, how can I not
have talent when I have your@0003
blood?@0003
So I was wondering if my old man
had the talent or not.@0003
@0009Your father had more talent with
dark magic than you could ever hope for.@0003
@000CWhat?
That makes no sense.@0003
...Wait!@0003
I got it!@0003
That's it!@0003
@0009What are you thinking now?@0003
@000CI'm not your real grandson, right!?
O-Ow!@0003
What'd you do that for?@0003
@0009I'm expressing my disgust at your
stupidity.@0003
You are indeed my grandson.@0003
I'm the one that brought you into
this world.@0003
@000C@0017You're kidding!@0003
My good looks couldn't have
come from your wrinkled face!@0003
@0009I was a stunning beauty when I was
your age.@0003
I would date men like you and dump
them after they spent all their@0003
money on me.@0003
@000C@0017Ouch...@0003
@0009Your kindness comes from your father,
and your talent for anima magic comes@0003
from your mother.@0003
Your stupidity... that probably comes
from your grandfather.@0003
@000CWhat?
My mom wasn't a Shaman?@0003
@0009@0017At first, I was determined to make
my son's wife a Shaman.@0003
But your mother was a fine young lady
with a distinct talent for anima magic,@0003
so I couldn't help but give in.@0003
@0017...I was proud of them both...
But they died so young.@0003
@000CYou must be disappointed that all
you have left is a pathetic little@0003
grandson, eh, Grandma?@0003
@0009@0017@0016......@0016
The strange thing is, I'm not.@0003
I can't say how much I missed
yelling at you when you were gone.@0003
Maybe they really are cuter when
they're more troublesome.@0003
I certainly want you to live a
long and fulfilling life, Hugh.@0003
@000C@0017...Grandma.@0003
[046B]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0123@000C@0017Hey!@0003
@0009Oh.@0003
@000CThere you are!@0003
I never would've guessed you'd
be here in this army.@0003
I've been looking all over for you!@0003
@0009...Well,
I sure wasn't looking for you.@0003
@000CTaking advantage of my kindness
like that...@0003
This is why I don't like kids.@0003
Now give me back my Resire book.@0003
@0009Ah, yes.
That thing.@0003
@000C...You haven't used it up
already, have you?@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000C...Hey...@0003
@0009...Calm down, I've got it.
I was just borrowing it.@0003
I was planning on giving it
back to you some day.@0003
@000CY-You little runt...@0003
You said you just wanted to see it
for a sec, so I lent it to you.@0003
I wasn't expecting you to take it
and run off!@0003
@0009Look, I've said this a million times.
I'm borrowing it, not stealing it.@0003
@000CWell, when are you
going to return it?@0003
@0009Well, let's see...@0003
I suppose I'll give it back
to you after I use it 20 times.@0003
@000CYou better keep your word!@0003
@0009Of course.@0003@0011
@000C...Oh well, I guess I'll just
have to wait...@0003
Whoa, wait a minute!@0003
It'll be gone by the time you use
it 20 times!@0003
[046C]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0123@000C@0017Hey.@0003
@0009Oh.@0003
@000CI'm not letting you go this time!
Give me back that Resire book now!@0003
@0009...Sorry, but I can't.@0003
@000CWhat!?@0003
@0009You're a mage.@0003
What's the point in you having
a Resire book?@0003
@000CErg...
That's not the point...@0003
@0009A powerful spell that could be
put to use in battle would be@0003
wasting away in your hands.@0003
Who would be responsible if we lost
a battle because we didn't use it?@0003
@000CEr...@0003
F-Fine, I'll let you have it for
now.@0003
But you're going to give it back
to me with interest, you hear!?@0003@0011@0007
@0009@0017...Hmph, what an idiot.@0003
How can he be fooled by such a
lame excuse?@0003
I have yet to understand such
blatant stupidity.@0003
@000C@0010@0123@0017...Hey.@0003
@0009...Crap...@0003@0011
@000CYou little...!
Give it back to me now!@0003
[046D]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0123
@000C@0017Hm?
What's this?@0003
@0009I'll give you that gem.@0003
@000CWhere did you get this?@0003
@0009That's none of your business.@0003
Anyway, I'm giving you that
in return for the spell book.@0003
@000CNope.
I can't accept this!@0003
@0009Why not?@0003
The gem's enough to buy another
Resire book.@0003
@000CThis isn't about money.
It's about my pride.@0003
...Let's see...
I want you to apologize to me.@0003
Then you can have the
spell book for free.@0003
@0009@0017Ha...@0003
I can't believe you're being so
stubborn over something so stupid.@0003
@000C@0017Hey, so are you.@0003
All you have to do is say
you're sorry.@0003
@0009@0017Well, I won't.@0003
I've paid you back with the
gemstone.@0003
@000CWell, I'm not taking it.@0003
You're going to be in my
debt until you apologize!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C......@0016@0003
@0009...Hmph...
Adults.@0003
@000C...What a stubborn little brat.@0003
[046E]
@000C@0010@0123One, two three...@0003
Yup, I've got it all.@0003
Looks like I can trust that Roy
to give me a steady paycheck.@0003
Well, I guess it's time to
show them my worth...@0003
@0009@0010@012CHey!@0003
@000C@0017Wh-What the?@0003
@0009Where'd you get all that money?
Are you a thief as well?@0003
@000C@0017Do I look like a thief to you?@0003
They paid me this money when I
joined.@0003
@0009@0017What!?
That's not fair!
I've been working for nothing all
this time!@0003
@000C@0017Well, I guess you're not good
enough to pay.@0003
You've got to show them your worth
if you want cash.@0003
@0009@0017...Hmm...@0003
@0017I'll take those words as a challenge!@0003
I'll show you my worth as a thief.@0003
I'll steal that money from right
under your nose!@0003@0011
@000C@0017Wait, what!?
Fine, dammit!@0003
Take it if you can!@0003
[046F]
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0123@0009Hey, Hugh!@0003
@000C@0016...!@0003
@0009@0016@0017What are you getting all
uptight about?@0003
I'm just trying to be friendly here.@0003
Do you really think I'll try to
steal in a place like this?@0003
@000CWell, I'm not trusting you anymore!@0003
I'm gonna be on my guard whenever
you're around.@0003
@0009@0017Ha, you've got such petty thoughts.@0003
You're getting all worked up about
a couple thousand gold?@0003
@000C@0017W-Well, it's still money to me!@0003
@0009Hm, I suppose I'm going to have some
trouble with you on your watch like@0003
that.@0003
I guess I'll pass it up for today.@0003
@000CRight!
Just give it up and go!@0003
@0009@0017All right.
But remember, Hugh!@0003
I'll be back!@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
[0470]
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0123@000C@0017You again!?@0003
It doesn't matter how many times
you come.@0003
I'm not giving you this money.@0003
@0009@0017Are you still saying that?
Geez!@0003
@000C@0017Then stop trying to take it!@0003
I mean, don't you already have
a ton of money if you're a thief?@0003
@0009No.@0003
Why would I?@0003
@000CYeah, right!@0003
I see you running around looting
chests all the time!@0003
@0009I give it all to the poor.@0003
@0017I'm a master thief, I have my
dignity.@0003
I would never even keep 1G of the
money I steal.@0003
@000C@0017Then...@0003
Are you going to give the money you
take from me to the poor as well?@0003
@0009Of course.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016Hey...@0003
You can have maybe a hundred...@0003
No...@0003
I can give you around half of this
money to...@0003
@0009...No.@0003
I'm a master thief,
I have my dignity.@0003
I don't take offers
from other people.@0003
@000CLook, I'm giving it to you.
Just take it!@0003
@0009I said no.
I don't want it.@0003
Besides...@0003@0002
I've already got your money.@0003
@000CWhat!?@0003
What... what the hell!?
When did you switch...@0009@0011@0003
@000CCass!@0003
Wait!@0003
Just wait a second, please!@0003
[0471]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0125@0009Hm...@0003
@000C@0017?
...What?@0003
@0009@0017I see you use dark magic.@0003
Although it looks like you're
still a beginner.@0003
@000C@0017!
...Look, old lady.@0003
I'm busy.@0003
I don't have time to spare on old
folk like you.@0003
@0009Come now, there's no need to rush.@0003
Studying on your own isn't going to
get you anywhere, anyway.@0003
@000C!?@0003
How do you know...@0003
@0009...I haven't lived this long
for nothing, boy.@0003
I think I've seen more darkness
than you have.@0003
@000CWho...@0003
Who are you?@0003
@0009My name is Niime.@0003
You should remember your
elders' names...@0003
[0472]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0125@0009Ah, it's the rude little
chap from the other day.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0017You...you're 'The Hermit on the
Mountain.'@0003
The master of darkness.@0003
@0009@0017Well, I see I've become famous.
What do you want from me?@0003
@000C@0017...I...
I want you to teach me your dark magic.@0003@0002
Teach me all of it!@0003
@0009@0017Hm...@0003
Boy, is that how you ask
people for favors?@0003
@000C@0017...I'll change my tone if you
don't like it.@0003
If you want me to bow my head to the
ground and apologize, I'll do it.@0003
So please, teach me your dark magic!@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@0017Hm, interesting...@0003
...All right, try reading this
for a start.@0003
@000C@0017...What...is this...?@0003
@0009@0017Can't you tell?@0003
It's an archaic language used
in the oldest spells.@0003
@000C@0017What...?@0003
The ancient scrolls I know
aren't written like this...@0003
@0009@0017Do you understand how deep
dark magic is now?@0003
I'll give you that.
Good luck reading it.@0003@0011@0007
@000C@0017Hmph...@0003
Of course I'll read it...@0003
[0473]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0125@0009Well?
How's your studying going?@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Hm...@0003
Don't even have the time to talk,
eh?@0003
You're a rude one, and you don't
Know how to respect your elders.@0003@0002
But you seem to be serious about
learning dark magic.@0003
Boy, why do you seek the power
of darkness?@0003
@000C@0017...It's not like I have some grandiose
reason.@0003
I use dark magic for myself.@0003
I want to protect those I hold dear,
and destroy all those who oppose me.@0003
That's the power I seek.@0003
The power you're trying to obtain...@0003
It's not to be taken lightly.@0003
It can tilt the planet if used
incorrectly.@0003
@000C@0017Hmph...so?@0003
I'll blow up a planet or two any day.@0003
@0009@0017...I see.@0003
Well said, boy.@0003
Now come... come into the
depths of darkness...@0003@0002
Of course, you're going to
have to study that book first.@0003
@000C...
...Thank you.@0003
@0009Hm?
What was that?@0003
@000C...Nothing.@0003
[0474]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@012D@000C@0017Oh...@0003
Hello...@0003
@0009@0017So you're the priestess of Nabata?@0003
@000C@0017Yes...@0003
My name... is Sophia...@0003
@0009@0017A shy one, aren't we?@0003
Well, I suppose anyone would be shy
after spending her whole life in@0003
that place...@0003
You're just like me when I was
your age.@0003
@000C@0017Really...?@0003
@0009@0017My name is Niime.@0003
I want to know more about
your village in Nabata.@0003
@000C@0017About the village...?@0003
@0009@0017Right.@0003
Oh, before that...
Are you human, or Dragon?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017I am human...@0003
At least...my father was human...@0003
@0009@0017I see...@0003
Forget about it.
Sorry for being so intrusive.@0003
[0475]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@012D@000C@0017Arcadia...is inside the sandstorm...@0003
There aren't many Dragons...
But there are many people... who have@0003
Dragon blood... in them...@0003
@0009@0017You said you were a priestess,
but what exactly do you do?@0003
Do you go around doing rain dances?@0003
@000C@0017I...can see...
@0009See?@0003
@000CI can sometimes see...
the future...@0003
@0009...Really?@0003
Is that because of the Dragon's
blood in you?@0003
@000C...I...don't know...@0003
@0009Hm...@0003
You'd better not tell that to anyone
else.@0003
Your power would be too dangerous for
our enemies.@0003
Even knowing the next day's weather
could make or break a battle.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016@0017Not all outsiders are nice people.@0003
I heard you were being held captive
by Bern, but you don't want to go@0003
through that again, do you?@0003
@000C@0017No...@0003
I don't...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016@0017...Don't worry.@0003
Roy wouldn't think of taking advantage
of you.@0003
You're safe here.@0003
@000C@0017Yes...@0003
[0476]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@012D@0009@0017What are Dragons, anyway?
Where do they come from?@0003
What are they here for?@0003
@000C...I don't know...@0003
I don't know... anything specific...@0003
@0009Hm... I see.@0003
You don't know anything about the
Dragons, but you have their blood@0003
in you.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016If you were a normal girl, you could
lead an ordinary life, not having@0003
people hunt you down for your power...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016I... This is me...@0003
Even the Dragon blood that flows in
me... it is what makes me who I am...@0003
@0009I see... you're right.@0003
@0017You are a strong one.@0003
@000C@0017Me... strong...?@0003
@0009@0017Yes, you're strong.@0003
You really are just like me
when I was your age.@0003
@000C@0017I... I see...@0003
[0477]
@000C@0010@0125@0009@0010@012D@000C@0017Hey, you over there!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Hey!@0003
Can you not hear me,
or are you just ignoring me?@0003
@0009...Uh...
...Me?@0003
@000CIs there anyone else here?@0003
Geez, are you deaf, or just
plain stupid?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016@0017Anyway, I heard you use ancient
dark magic.@0003
Is it true?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Let me see your spell books.
I don't think I've ever seen...@0003@0080@000E
@0017Ow!@0003

What the...@0003
Did you just do that?@0003
@0009...Please... don't touch... 
me...@0003
@000C@0017...Well, well...
You dare stand up to me?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Ah, fine.
I'll leave you alone for now.@0003
But you're showing me that
spell book next time we meet!@0003@0011
@0009@0016......@0003
[0478]
@000C@0010@0125@0007@0009@0010@012D@0016......@0003
@000C@0016@0017? Whoa!?@0003
Y-You!?
Damn, how could I not have
noticed you coming so close...@0003
Wh-What do you want!?@0003
Are you trying to pay me
back for the other day?@0003
@0009...Here...@0003
@000CThe dark magic book!@0003
The one they don't know even
exists...@0003
@0009...Yes...
...You know much...@0003
@000COf course I do!@0003
Do you have any idea how long
I've been looking for this!?@0003
@0017So this is it...@0003
Wow...
I can feel it's power...!@0003
@0009@0017...Do you want it...?@0003
@000CI can have it!?
But... are you sure?@0003
Don't you need it as well?
Why give it to me?@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003@0011
@000CHey, wait! Hey!@0003
[0479]
@000C@0010@0125@0009@0010@012D@000C@0017Hey, you over there!
You!@0003
With the long dragging hair!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I'm giving this spell book
back to you.@0003
@0009...What?
...Why...?@0003
@000CI don't need things to be
given to me.@0003
I'm not a beggar.@0003
@0009...Yes...@0003
...But...
I wanted to give it... to you...@0003
@000CWhat?
Why?@0003
@0009...Because...
You are a good person...@0003
@000CHuh?@0003
@0009...You always act strong...@0003
...But... you actually have a kind
heart... So... I wanted to give@0003
it to you...@0003
@000CI have a kind heart!?@0003
Only my brother ever said something
as ridiculous as that!@0003
@0009...I know you... better than you
know yourself...@0003
@000C...Don't talk like that.
You'll scare people off.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Well, it doesn't bother me, though.@0003
@0009@0017...Thank you...@0003@000C@0017...What's your name?
I'm Ray.@0003
@0009@0017...Ray...@0003
My name... is Sophia...@0003
[047A]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@0126@000CEchidna!@0003
@0009Hey, Lalam.
What's up?@0003
@000CWhat's happening with the plan?@0003
@0009Plan?@0003
@000CYeah, the plan about
building that village.@0003
@0009Oh.@0003
Yeah, I've been going around
recruiting help.@0003
Are you going to help out, too?@0003
@000COf course!@0003
What do you want me to do?@0003

@0009Dance, of course.@0003
Your dancing cheers everyone up.@0003
It makes people feel like getting up
and working some more.@0003
@000CYou think so?@0003
Hmm...
Well, I can cook, too.@0003
You know my Special Stamina...@0003
@0009No way.@0003
@000CW-What?@0003
@0009Ever since I started the rebellion,
I've been eating your...@0003
I can't even bear to say it in
words.@0003
Anyway, I wouldn't call it food.@0003
@000CI never!
I've always been trying...@0003
@0009Look, Lalam.@0003
You usually don't end up burning
the house down when you cook a@0003
proper meal.@0003
@000CThat's not a big loss, considering
how well my food tastes.@0003
@0009The wails and moans of the rebel leaders...
I can still hear them echoing in my ears.@0003
Has Elphin ever eaten it?@0003
@000CYeah.
But he didn't say anything.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CYou see?@0003
There's something wrong with everyone
else's taste buds.@0003
My food was probably too high-
class for them.@0003
Maybe...@0003
Roy might appreciate my fine
taste.@0003
Yes!@0003
I'm sorry, Echidna.@0003
I have to make Roy try my cooking!@0003@0011
@0009...I'm sorry, Roy...@0003
[047B]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@0126@000COh, Echidna.@0003
@0009Lalam.
Hey...@0003
You were talking about feeding
that stuff to Roy, but...@0003
did you really do it?@0003
@000C@0017What's that supposed to mean!?
He praised me!@0003
He said that it was really...@0002
uh...that it looked really good.@0003
@0009So he ate it, huh?
@0017When's the funeral?@0003
@000C@0017Hmph!@0003
I just wasn't doing too well that
day!
My stepfather always said that
he loved my cooking.@0003
@0009@0017Now, now, even if you can't cook, your
dancing is still the best in the world.@0003
I should be working hard, too, to let
the people live in peace.@0003
@000C...You know,
you're really noble.@0003
@0009@0017W-What?@0003
@000C@0017You're always thinking about others.@0003
Even this, building a village so that
other people can live in peace.@0003
@0009I...@0003
@000CYou're like those heroes that appear
in the sagas that bards sing!@0003
You appear, help the needy, and leave
as suddenly as you had come...@0003
You're also mysterious since you never
tell anybody about yourself.@0003
@0009@0017Right...I don't.@0003
@000C@0017But I won't ask.@0003
I'm really curious, but there must be
an important reason why you won't@0003
tell us.@0003
[047C]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@0126@000CHey, Echidna!@0003
@0009Yeah?@0003
@000CI just had a really
great idea!@0003
@0009What is it?@0003
@000CDo you want to hear it?@0003
@0009Well, yeah.@0003
@000CAre you sure?@0003
@0009@0017Yes, I'm sure.
@0017Come on, let's hear it.@0003
@000COkay.@0003
I was thinking, when the village is
done, let's put a statue there.@0003
@0009A statue?@0003
@000CA statue of you!@0003
It can have an engraving that says,
'A great hero lies here...'@0003
or something like that.@0003
@0009@0017Hey, hey,
I don't plan on dying yet.@0003
@000CAnyway, it's your village, so there
has to be a statue of you somewhere.@0003
Make sure you think of a pose for it.@0003@0011
@0009@0017She's an odd girl...@0003
Well, I guess that's nothing
new.@0003
@000C@0010@0126Oh, one more thing!@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000CDon't you go disappearing on us!
We all love you, you know.@0003
Don't you dare try and
run off!@0003@0011
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016Yeah... I know, Lalam.@0003
[047D]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0135@000C@0017Hey, you...@0003
@0009@0080@000BEeeeeeeek!
A pirate!@0003
@000CW-Wait a minute!@0003
@0009Eeeeeeeek!@0080@000B@0080@000B
Help help help!@0003
@000CS-Stop...
Wait!@0003
Listen to me!@0003
@0009What?
Pirates are all the same.@0003
You're just going to say shut up, or
you'd better not say a word if you@0003
want to live, or something like that.@0003
Oh!@0003
Lalam's in grave danger!
But just you wait.@0003
Soon Roy'll appear on a shining
white stallion and rescue me...@0003
@000C...Um, are you done?@0003
Listen.
I'm not a pirate anymore.@0003
@0009Hmph!@0003
Even if you try to act good like
that, I know better!@0003
I know you're trying to run off
with me because I'm so irresistible.@0003
@000C...You've got to be kidding me.@0003
@0009Kidding!?@0003
What, are you saying that I'm
not cute enough to kidnap!?@0003
@000CYou...@0003
No...forget it.
Sorry to bother you.@0003@0011
@0009Hey, wait!@0003
[047E]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0135@0009@0017@0080@000BEeeeeeek!
It's the pirate again!@0003
@000CI said I'm not...@0003
@0009Are you still trying to cover
up the obvious truth?@0003
Your hairstyle, your clothes...@0003
Everything about you is just
screaming, 'I'm a pirate!'@0003
@000C...Fine...
Have it your way.@0003
@0009Aha!
You admit it!@0003
And?@0003
You're still trying to
run off with me, right?@0003
@000CHey...@0003
Would you please listen
to what I have to say...@0003
@0009Oh!
Lalam's in great danger!@0003
But just you wait.@0003
@0080@C282oy'll beat you down any day!@0003
@000A@0011@000C@0080@000F@000B@0010@0126
@0017'Are you all right, Lalam?'@0003@0011
@000A@0010@0126@0017'Oh, Master Roy...'@0003@0011
@000B@0010@0126@0017'Lalam,
I can't live without you.'@0003@0011
@000A@0010@0126@0017'Oh, thank you, Master Roy...'@0003@0002
And then we...
@0080@000COoooohhhh!@0003
@000D@0016......@0003
@000A@0016Hey,
where are you doing?@0003
@000DSee you later...@0003
Talking with you is exhausting.@0003
[047F]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0135@000C@0017Hey.@0003
@0009It's the pirate!@0003
Are you still trying to...@0003
@000CThis is yours, right?@0003
@0009Oh...@0003
I lost this ribbon the other day.
Wait!@0003
I get it.@0003
You stole it, right!?@0003
@000CWhy the hell would I return it
to you!?@0003
I found it lying on the ground, and
I thought it might be yours.@0003
@0009Oh.@0003
Then why didn't you say
so in the first place?@0003
@000CI would have if you let me!@0003
You just start screaming
whenever we meet!@0003
If only you'd stop and
listen once in a while...@0003
@0009@0017So you weren't a bad person after all.
I shouldn't have been so scared, then.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0011
@0009@0016Hey, wait.@0003
I'll show you a special dance
in return.
Hey, wait...@0003
What!@0003
Are you trying to tell me my
dancing isn't worth watching!?@0003
[0480]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0128@000C@0017Yuno...
Are you all right?@0003
@0009Oh?@0003
Are you looking out for me,
Tate?@0003
@000CWell, you've been retired
for a while now, so...@0003
I'm sure you'll be all right,
but anything can happen, right?@0003
I was a little worried.@0003
@0009@0017Thanks...
But I'll be fine.@0003
How about you?@0003
How is your work as a flight leader
going?@0003
You're responsible, so I thought
you'd be all right, but did you@0003
get along okay with your squad?@0003
@000C@0017I didn't do anything special...
@0017but I think I did all right.@0003
@0009Then I'm sure you did fine,
Tate.@0003
Good girl...@0003
@000C@0017Y-Yuno!@0003
@0009@0017Oh...@0003
You don't like having your
head petted anymore?@0003
You used to love it.@0003
@000C@0017T-That was a long time ago...@0003
I'm not...you know,
a kid anymore.@0003
@0009So you don't like it?@0003
@000CIt's not that I don't
like it, but...you know...@0003
[0481]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0128@000C@0017Yuno...@0003
@0009@0017Tate?
What's the matter?@0003
@000C@0017Nothing.@0003
I was just wondering whether
you're all right...@0003
@0009@0017Wait, Tate.@0003
Let's chat a little.@0003
@000C@0017Um...
but...@0003
@0009@0017It's okay, Tate.@0003
You can be my little sister
when we're alone together.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016You're a strong girl,
but you easily get lonely...@0003@0002
Do you remember the time when I
first left to go train as a@0003
Pegasus Knight?@0003
You thought I was leaving forever,
and you...@0003
@000C@0017D-Don't bring that up...!@0003
I was still a little girl
back then...@0003
@0009@0017I was glad you cared so much
about me, Tate.@0003
You were always so blunt, so at times
I thought you didn't like me at all.@0003
@000C@0017No...@0003
@0009@0017But...you cried so much at that time.
You were sobbing, 'Don't go, Yuno.'@0003
I felt like crying myself.@0003
@000C@0017Yuno...@0003
@0009@0017Tate, if you're ever feeling down,
come talk to me.@0003
Because... I'll always be
your big sister.@0003
@000CYeah...@0003
[0482]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0128@000CYuno?@0003
@0009Yes?@0003
@000CI was thinking...@0003
Maybe you should leave the rest of
the battle up to us and rest a bit.@0003
You know you're a mother now, so...@0003
@0009Oh?@0003
Should the old ladies be stepping
back now?@0003
@000C@0017N-No, that's not what I mean.
I just...@0003
@0009@0017I know, Tate.
Thank you.@0003
But I'll be fine.
I am still an Ilian Pegasus Knight.@0003
Don't forget, I taught you how to ride
your pegasus in the first place.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I know, but...@0003
@0017......
If something happens...@0003
I'll be there for you,
Yuno.@0003
@0009Yes...
Thank you, Tate.@0003
[0483]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0129@000CIt's big sister Yuno!@0003
@0009Thany.
Have you been well?@0003
@000CYes!
Really well.@0003
@0009It's already been a year since you
left for training...@0003
Are you getting along with the
members of the mercenary band?@0003
I heard they were all men,
but are you doing all right?@0003
@000CYeah, I'm doing fine!
They're all really nice people.@0003
And I'm doing really well in
battle, too!@0003
I'm the one doing all the work.@0003
@0009Really?@0003
@000CAnd then!@0003
After we joined Master Roy, the enemies
started getting stronger...@0003
But still it's as if I defeated all
of them!@0003
@0009Wow...
That's amazing.@0003
You've been working hard, Thany...@0003
@000CTehe...@0003
[0484]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0129@000CYuno!@0003
@0009What is it,
Thany?@0003
@000CTeach me how to ride a
pegasus like you.@0003
The way you fly is really neat.
I wish I could fly like that...@0003
@0009@0017I'd like to, but not now.
We're in a battle.@0003
I can teach you when we
have some free time...@0003
@000C...Oh.@0003
@0017The let's practice our move!@0003
@0009Move...?@0003
@000CThe Triangle Attack!@0003
@0009Oh, that move mother used to
tell us about...@0003
@0017But we need Tate to do
the Triangle Attack.@0003
@000COh... right.
@0017Then, um...@0003
@0009What's the matter,
Thany?@0003
@000CWe just met after a long time,
right?@0003
I don't want us to be separated
so quickly again...@0003
@0009...You always used to stick to me like
that ever since you were little.@0003
Thany, I want you to be a good girl
and wait until the war is over.@0003
Then you can be close to me however
much you want...@0003
@000CYeah... you're right.@0003
Okay!@0003
[0485]
.o ait seems like the idiots
starting wars don't realize that.@0003
@000C@0016...@0003
@0009@0016@0017Well anyway, if there are kids
who can still laugh, I suppose@0003
there's still hope for this world.@0003
I know it's been tough for you,
but make sure to laugh once in a@0003
while, okay?@0003
@000C@0017H-Hey!
Don't mess up my hair!@0003
@0009@0017Hahahaha, sorry!
Well then, see you later.@0003
Don't mess up, you got that?@0003
@0011
@000C...Maybe there is still hope for
this world with adults like you...@0003
[0486]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0129@000CYuno!@0003
@0009Thany.@0003
I haven't told you this yet, but...@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009While you were away,
we had a baby girl.@0003
@000CWhat!?@0003
A baby between you and Zealot!?
Where, where?@0003
I want to carry her...@0003
@0009I can't bring her to the
battlefield, Thany.@0003I entrusted her to the
nannies back home.@0003
You can see her when
we go home.@0003
@000CYay!@0003
Yuno's baby...
she must be so cute!@0003Oh, I really want to see her!@0003
@0009You will, don't worry.@0003
@000C@0017Wait.@0003
Then...
That makes me an...aunt?@0003
But I'm still so young...@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0132@000C@0017Yuno, um...@0003
@0009@0017Yes?
What is it, Zealot?@0003
@000C@0017Our daughter...
Is she all right?@0003
@0009@0017Yes, I'm sure she is.@0003
I've entrusted her to a good friend.@0003
@000C@0017Oh...@0003
@0009@0017Is something wrong?@0003
@000C@0017No, it's just...
What's she like?@0003
Does she look like you or me?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, you haven't seen her yet,
have you.@0003
@000C@0017No.
I've always been out working.@0003
@0009@0017We shall go pick her up
once the war ends.@0003
@000C@0017Yes...we shall.@0003
[0487]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0132@000C@0017Yuno,
I was thinking...@0003
@0009@0017Yes?@0003
@000C@0017I don't think it's a good idea to
leave a newborn baby with someone else.@0003
You should go back home and take
care of her.@0003
@0009@0017It's all right.@0003
I've entrusted her to a very
good friend of mine.
@000C@0017But you're her mother.@0003
@0009@0017I'm fighting because I'm her mother.@0003
I want to raise her in a
peaceful time without war.@0003
@000C@0017But...@0003
@0009I might have told you this before, but
it would be impossible to find a@0003
completely safe place until we end
this war.@0003
@000CWell, that's true...@0003
@0009@0017In that case,
let's focus on ending this war.@0003
All right, Zealot?@0003
@000C@0017Hm...@0003
[0488]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0132@0009You're coming back to Edessa
once the war ends, aren't you?@0003
@000C@0017Of course.@0003
@0009Will you always stay with
us after that?@0003
@000CProbably not...@0003
I'll have to lead the mercenary knights
around looking for work as usual.@0003
We can't support ourselves otherwise.@0003
@0009But we've cultivated most of
Ilia's lands now.@0003
If we put our best efforts in,
we could produce enough food...@0003
@000CBut that wouldn't happen overnight.@0003
@0009Well yes, but...@0003
@000CBesides, we wouldn't be guaranteed
a good harvest every year.@0003
Where would the money for our food
come from if the crops were to fail?@0003
How would we survive the winter if
we're not prepared for a failure?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I must lead the mercenary knights and
collect money until we are able to@0003
to support ourselves even in times
when the crops do fail.@0003
I'll leave Edessa to you, so you
should do your best to cultivate@0003
the land.@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
@000C@0017But I have faith that there will come
a time when we will have good harvests@0003
in Ilia as well.@0003
@0009Yes, I have faith, too.@0003
I know that there will come a time
when we will always be together@0003
[0489]
@000C@0010@0127Treck?@0006@0003
@0017Oh...he was here just a minute
ago...@0003
Hm?@0003
What's this... did he drop it when
he left?@0003
It has a lot of small writing
on it...@0003
Let's see...@0003
...'I became a horse.'@0003
...'I tried running.'@0003
...'I got tired.'@0003
...???@0003
[048A]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@0127@000COh, Treck.
I was looking for you.@0003
@0009Oh, hullo,
Lady Yuno.@0003
@000CYou look as sleepy as usual.
Oh, right... Here.@0003
Is this yours?@0003
@0009Huh?@0003
Ah...
Yeah, It's mine.@0003
I lost it the other day.@0003
@000CI thought so.@0003
I'm sorry, but I read a
little bit of it...@0003
What are you writing about?@0003
@0009Well, I write down what kind of
dreams I have on this piece of paper.@0003
@000CDreams?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
When I look at it, I remember all
the kinds of dreams I've had so far,@0003
and it helps me sleep well.@0003
Yawn...@0003
@000COh, I see.
That sounds interesting...@0003
Maybe I should try, too.@0003
[048B]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@0127
@000CTreck?@0003
@0009Yes?@0003
@000CCan you show me that paper
with your dreams on it?@0003
It seems I've become interested
in it.@0003
@0009Uhm... Sure.@0003
@000CThank you.@0003@0002
'I was praised by General Zealot.'@0003
He comes out in your dreams
too?@0003
@0009Yeah, he does.@0003
@000CLet's see...@0003
'The war ended.'@0003
'It became peaceful.'@0003
'Spring came to Ilia.'@0003
'Everyone lived and slept
happily ever after...'@0003
@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Huh?@0003
Is something wrong,
Lady Yuno?@0003
@000C...No, I'm sorry.@0003
......@0003
Can you show me your dreams
sometime again, Treck?@0003
@0009Well...@0003
It's kind of embarrassing, to
tell you the truth.@0003
But okay, you can see them.@0003
I'll go to sleep so you
can get the latest ones.@0003
@000CThank you, Treck.@0003
[048C]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0130@0009Oh, Noah.@0003@000CHello, Lady Yuno.@0003
Are you all right?@0003
@0009You're worried about me?@0003
What a surprise.@0003
@000C@0017...I'm not that antisocial,
Lady Yuno...@0003
@0009@0017I was just kidding.@0003
You seem uncaring, but on
the inside, you have a kind heart.@0003
Are you all right?@0003
You've gone through many
battles coming here, right?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I'm fine.@0003
General Zealot helped us greatly.@0003
@0017It's thanks to him I'm
alive right now.@0003
@0009@0017I see...@0003
He always strains himself
in battle...@0003
[048D]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0130@0009@0017Sigune...
She turned to Bern.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
She ambushed us in the blizzard
with her Pegasus Knight squad.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
Sigune and I used to be
rivals, you know.@0003
We were always competing
against each other.@0003
It all seems so... faraway
when I remember it now.@0003@000C@0016.......@0003
@0009@0016Sigune always tried to act bad, but
she was really a kindhearted person.@0003
If only we weren't in times like
this, we could have...@0003
War is a painful thing.@0003
@000C... Yes.@0003
But that's what war is.@0003
[048E]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0130@0009Noah.@0003
@000CYes?@0003
@0009You seem to avoid developing
close relationships.@0003
Is that because you don't want to
suffer from losing that person?@0003
@000C...I wonder.@0003
It is easier to just avoid
getting close with anyone.@0003
The tighter the bond, the greater
your suffering when that bond is@0003
broken.@0003
...I think you know that better
better than any of us.@0003@0009Yes...@0003
Perhaps it's better to live
like you do in Ilia.@0003
But there will come a time when you
will realize that close relationships@0003
aren't all bad.@0003
Maybe you'll understand when you fall
yourself in love with someone.@0003
[048F]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0129@000CHey!
Big sister!@0003
@0009@0017...Thany, this is a battlefield.@0003
What if an archer heard you
screaming like that?@0003
@000C@0017Don't worry.
No archer could hit me.@0003
@0009@0017...Sigh...@0003
...Thany, where are your reins?@0003
You could fall off your
pegasus without them.@0003
@000C@0017Well,
I took them off.@0003
@0009@0017Took them off?@0003
Thany, you never know what
can happen.@0003
So considering all possibilities...@0003
@000C@0017Thany, you're such a worrier!@0003
Flying is more enjoyable without
all the extra gear on.@0003@0002
See ya!@0003@0011
@0009@0017Thany, wait!
I'm not finished yet...@0003@0002
...Sigh.@0003
[0490]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0129@000C@0017Tate...
You're starting to get annoying...@0003
@0009I'm saying these things
for your sake.@0003
If you can't listen to your big
sister, I won't let you ride on@0003
a pegasus any more.@0003
@000CWhat!?
But...@0003
@0009Thany, it's your fault.@0003
@000CYou're always like that!@0003
Always saying I'm the one to blame...@0003
You could say it in a little...
kinder tone...@0003
@0009But!
That's because you...!@0003
@000CNo!
I hate you!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C......@0003
@0009@0016Thany...
Um...@0003
@000CW-What the?!
What did you just do?!@0003
@0009Yuno, she... she used to
pet our heads like this, right?@0003
I'm your big sister too..@0003
So I thought I should make
you feel better...@0003@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Thany, I'm sorry..@0003
I can't be kind like Yuno,
can I...@0003
@000CTate...@0003
... Did you hit your
head or something?@0003
@0009......
This child...@0003
All right, I don't care anymore.@0003
You can fend for yourself
from now on!@0003@0011
@000C@0017Hey, wait!
Sorry!@0003
I just had to say it..@0003
[0491]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0129@000CHey!
Tate!@0003
@0009@0017...What?@0003
@000C@0017I'm sorry about the other day.@0003
But I was really happy that
you cared about me so much.@0003
I really love you, big sister
Tate!@0003
@0009@0016.....@0016@0003
@0017... How can you say such things
without getting embarrassed...@0003
I really envy you sometimes..@0003
@000C@0017What about you?
Do you love me, too?@0003
@0009@0017...There's no need to say that
out loud..@0003
@000CYou... don't love me..?@0003
@0009It's just that...@0003
You don't have to say it here,
in the middle of...@0003@000COh... I...
didn't know.@0003
Thany...
you always hated me...@0003
@0009All right, all right!
I love you!@0003
@0017Of course I love you.
You're my only little sister.@0003
I'll...
I'll always care for you.@0003
@000CTeehee... Thanks!
See you!@0003@0011
@0009That child...@0003
[0492]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0132@0009@0017General Zealot, I'm sure you know
already, but my mission has been@0003
accomplished.@0003
Still, I wish to remain in this
army.@0003
@000CAll right.@0003
You know, fate can work in strange
ways.@0003
We were hired by the Lycia Alliance
Army, and you were hired by the@0003
Etrurian Army...@0003
I never thought that we would meet.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
Although Etruria didn't seem to
view us very highly, General@0003
Klein was caring.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
Yuno was pretty worried about
you and Thany.@0003
Knowing you, I would think you'd
be all right.@0003
But you know Yuno,
she's a worrier.@0003@0009Yes, I understand.@0003
Our sister was often too soft
on Thany and me.@0003
The day we left was a hectic one,
indeed.@0003
Yuno was constantly fretting over
us, worrying about our meals, and@0003
our clothes...@0003
@000C@0017Haha, that's Yuno.@0003
[0493]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0132@000C@0017I was wondering...@0003
Yuno's... your parents...@0003
What were they like?@0003@0009Haven't you heard from Yuno?@0003
@000CNo.@0003
All I know is that they were
soldiers.@0003
@0009Yes, our mother was a
Pegasus Knight.@0003
Our parents were killed together
on the same battlefield when we were@0003
still young.@0003@000C@0016.......@0003
@0009@0016We had no other relatives to depend
on...@0003
Yuno became our mother, when she
was only a teenager...@0003
@000CI see.@0003
@0009While an ordinary girl of her age
would be concerning herself with@0003
romance, Yuno had to be our mother.@0003
But she never complained...
She always looked after us..@0003
With a smile on her face.
That's why...@0003
That's why I always wanted
Yuno to find happiness.@0003
[0494]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0132@000C...I have to thank you for
helping us with the wedding.@0003
You set up the place and
cooked for us..@0003
Oh, and Yuno was very pleased with the
wedding gift you and Thany sent us.@0003
@0009Really...?@0003
I actually didn't want to send
it...@0003
But Thany won't listen once
she's made up her mind.@0003@000CHahaha...@0003
That was an interesting gift, though.@0003
But...@0003
I have to apologize to Yuno about
that wedding.@0003
If only I had more...@0003
If only our nation were wealthier,
I could have given her a more@0003
proper and elegant wedding..@0003@0009@0017I doubt Yuno feels that way at
all.@0003
@0017I'm very grateful to you,
General Zealot.@0003
Your wedding...@0003
I had never seen Yuno with such a
happy face before.@0003
I want to thank you for what
you've done for her.@0003
[0495]
@0009@0010@0129@000C@0010@0132@0009Zealot!@0003
@000C@0017Thany.@0003
@0009@0017Hey Zealot...@0003
@0017Oh wait, you're now my brother
because you're Yuno's husband...@0003
@000C@0017You can call me as you
wish.@0003
@0009Oh, right!@0003
I wanted to ask you something.@0003
How did you meet Yuno?@0003
@000C@0017Well...@0003
Perhaps some other time.@0003
@0009@0017Why?
Don't be mean.@0003
Come on, tell me!@0003
@000C@0017No, I'm not being mean...@0003
You'll understand when you grow up,
but you shouldn't go around asking@0003
things like that..@0003
@0009@0017But I really want to know...@0003

As your sister, I should know
these things...@0003@000C@0011
@0009Zealot?
Wait!@0003
[0496]
@0009@0010@0129@000C@0010@0132@0009Zealot!@0003
@000C@0017...You won't let me go,
will you?@0003
@0009@0017But I'm family to you.@0003
I want to know about my relatives...@0003
@000C@0017Hm...@0003
All right, I suppose...@0003
...We first met in battle in Etruria@0003
Yuno's pegasus squad was hired by
our enemy side.@0003
@0009Whoa...@0003
@000CI attempted to settle things
peacefully through discussion.@0003
Yuno was a beautiful and caring
woman, so things went well.@0003
And then, things just
progressed after that.@0003
@0009@0017What were your proposal words?@0003
@000C@0017Y-You want me to tell you
that much?@0003
@0009@0017Yes.@0003
I'm your family... aren't I?@0003
@000C@0017Er...@0003
@0009@0017Did you propose first?
Or was it Yuno?@0003
@000C@0017Well...@0003
[0497]
@0009@0010@0129@000C@0010@0132@0009But I'm glad you turned
out to be a good person.@0003
You and Yuno really looked
perfect together.@0003
@000CThank you.@0003
I'm relieved you didn't
start hating me.@0003
@0009Why would I hate you?
You're strong, you're kind..@0003
And besides, you're the man Yuno
fell in love with.@0003
@000C@0017By the way...@0003
What about you?
Do you have someone in mind?@0003
@0009@0017Sorry, that's a secret!@0003
@000C@0017W-What?@0003
After making me confess that much,
you're not telling me?@0003@0009@0017We're family.@0003
Family members have to have some
secrets!@0003
@000C@0017W-Wait, Thany...@0003
@0009@0017See ya!@0003
[0498]
@000C@0010@012A@0005@0009@0010@012E@0017Zeiss!
Behind you!@0003
@000C!!@0003
@0009@0080@000CDarn...!@0003
@000A@0011@000C@0011@0007
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@012A
@000C...I'm sorry, Miledy.@0003
I was too focused on the
enemies in front of me.@0003
@0009@0017Don't worry about it.@0003
@0009Gale looked out for me like
this a lot, too.@0003
If we can survive by helping each
other out, then so much the better.@0003
@000C@0017But it would be better if I
could fend for myself..@0003
@0009@0017You're still learning.@0003
It's all right, I'll protect
you until you grow strong enough.@0003
@000C@0017...Thanks.@0003@0009@0011@0007
@000CBut...that won't do.@0003
I have to become strong enough
so I can protect her...!@0003
[0499]
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@012A@0009@0017Zeiss!
Slow down!@0003
You have to be more careful!@0003
@000CI've got him!@0003
@0009...Don't rush like that!@0003
You were lucky you were able
to kill him...@0003
@000CRight... I was able to kill him.
It's all right, Miledy.@0003
I was fine.@0003
@0009That doesn't mean you'll win
the next time!@0003
@000C... But it doesn't mean I'll
lose, either.@0003
@0009Zeiss...@0003
Why can't you listen to your big
sister?@0003
I would never be able to forgive myself
if I let something happen to you...@0003
@000C...You don't trust me, do you.@0003
Am I so weak that I can't even be
relied on?@0003
@0009Zeiss, I'm not saying that.@0003
@0009Stop being a child.@0003
@000CThen...
Stop treating me like one!@0003@0011
@0009Zeiss!@0003@0002
...Why...?@0003
[049A]
@000D@0010@012E@000D@0017That's it!@0003
@000B@0010@012AMiledy!@0003@001C
@000D!!@0003@001C
@000B@0011@000D@0011@0007
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@012A
@0009Zeiss!@0003
What were you thinking, taking a
blow for me like that!?@0003
@000C...So you also sometimes forget to pay
attention to the enemies around you,@0003
too, huh?@0003
Are you all right?@0003@0009Zeiss... What about you?
Aren't you hurt?@0003
@000CIt's just a scratch.
Miledy, your arm is bleeding..@0003
Hang on, I'll go get some vulneraries...@0003
@0009Zeiss!@0003
@000C?@0003
@0009...Thanks for saving me.@0003
@000CWhy wouldn't I?@0003@0011
@0009@0017...That Zeiss, protecting me?@0003
He's grown up so quickly...@0003
Well, it's no wonder he got angry when
I treated him like a child.@0003
[049B]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0134@000C@0017Pr...
Prince Mildain...?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Your Highness!
You were alive!?@0003
@0009......Have you mistaken me for
@0017someone?@0003
I'm Elphin...
A simple bard.@0003
@000C@0017No...
You are...!@0003
But...
No, it can't be...@0003
@0009@0017Excuse me?@0003
@000C@0017No...
Nothing.@0003
@0009@0017...Then I shall be off now.@0003
@000C@0017...He...@0003
He looks just like him.
...Too much like him...@0003
[049C]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0134@000C@0017Elphin!@0003@0009@0017...Can I help you,
General Cecilia?@0003
@000C@0017Have you ever visited
Etruria?@0003
@0009Not yet...@0003
I have been traveling through the
Western Isles.@0003
@000CThen do you know about the three
Etrurian Generals?@0003
@0009@0017...Yes, I do.@0003
There is you, the Sorcery General, in
addition to the Great General and the@0003
Knight General.@0003@000CYou are very knowledgeable.@0003
@0009As a bard, it is only natural that
I would hear about such things.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0017You insist on playing dumb,
do you?@0003
Then I have an idea as well.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000C@0017Let me see your right shoulder that
you are conveniently hiding with@0003
@0017your long hair.@0003
If you are but a simple bard as you
say you are, then there wouldn't be@0003
a scar from taking a powerful magic
hit, now, would there?@0003
May I have a look..?@0003@0009@0016......@0003
@0016@0017...Persistent, aren't you, Cecilia?@0003
@000C!
It is you, Prince Mildain!@0003
What happened?@0003
Why did you not tell me that
you were alive?@0003
@0009@0017...I did not want to get you
caught up in this.@0003
But it seems I have no
choice now.@0003
[049D]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0134@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Cecilia...@0003
How much longer are you going to
stay mad?@0003
@000C@0017I understand why you were hiding your
identity from me, prince.@0003
@0009@0017Thank you, Cecilia.@0003
@000C@0017But, your Highness, you told Lord
Douglas.@0003
Did you not have enough trust
to let me know as well?@0003
@0009@0017That's not what I intended...@0003
@000CI shall let it go for now,
Your Highness.@0003
I will be looking forward to your
explanation after the war.@0003
@0009@0017...Scary, as always.@0003
@000C@0017Of course.@0003
@000CYou have saddened not only me,
but your people as well.@0003
Please show our people that you
are safe, your Highness.@0003
@0017Please...@0003
@0009Yes...
I know, Cecilia.@0003
[049E]
@000C@0010@0135@0009@0010@012C@0009Hey, you're a pirate,
right?@0003
@000CHm?
Yeah...I guess.@0003
@0017That's what I look like,
huh?@0003
Man...@0003
@0009?@0003
@000C@0017I used to be a seagoing
merchant.@0003
@0009Really?@0003
You must've made a lot money, then.
Lucky you.@0003
Oh well, I guess we poor people have
to just keep working hard..@0003
@000C@0017Wait a sec.@0003
@0009@0017Huh?@0003
@000C@0017What's my bag doing in your
hand?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016Y-You're pretty perceptive,
aren't you?@0003
@000C@0017...Gee, thanks.@0003
@0009Hmmm...
All right!@0003
There's no treasure I can't
steal!@0003
Be ready the next time
we meet!@0003
[049F]
@000C@0010@0135@0009@0010@012C@0009Hey, Geeeese.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah?@0003
@0009@0017Ohhh...
I think I'm drunk...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Can you stay and revive me?
Come on..@0003
@000C@0017...Hey.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah?@0003
@000C@0017Were you hit with a
Berserk staff or something?@0003
@0009@0017Huh?@0003
@000C@0017Whatever you're doing, it's
not very convincing at all.@0003
@0009What!?@0003
You withstood my seduction moves!?
You're no ordinary man!@0003
@000C...Gee, thanks.@0003
But you know, I'm not really
suited for that role.@0003
@0009I-I know that!
I was just testing you!@0003
@0017I'll get serious next time.@0003
I'll take your stuff
without you even noticing!@0003
@000C@0017Uh-huh.
Good luck.@0003
[04A0]
@000C@0010@0135@0009@0010@012C@0009Geese!@0003
@000C@0017Yeah?@0003
@0009@0017Doesn't this look familiar?@0003
@000C@0017Hey, that's my...@0003
@0009@0017@0016Hehe!@0016@0003
Guess you weren't so good after
all!@0003
There's no treasure I can't steal!@0003
@000C@0017Sigh...@0003
@0009@0017Well, let's see now.
What have we got in here?@0003
@0016... ... ... ...
... ... ...@0003
@0016@0017What...
What the heck?!
This is nothing but junk!@0003
@000CIt's not junk.
Maps, compasses...@0003
It's equipment you need for sailing.@0003
@0009What about treasure?!
Where's the treasure?!@0003
@000C@0017Hahaha, there never was
any treasure!@0003
I'm broke.@0003
Drowning in debt,
to tell you the truth.@0003
I got nothing you can steal!@0003
@0009@0017Erg...@0003
How come you're bragging like
that?!@0003
You're broke!@0003@000C@0017I've got a dream.@0003
I'm gonna go back to being
a trader and hit a jackpot.@0003
You'll see, I'll fill my ship
with riches in no time.@0003
Then you'll have something
to steal!@0003
@0009@0016.........@0003
@0016@0017Did... Did I lose?
Are you a big shot?@0003
...Or just an idiot?@0003

[04A1]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@012E@000C@0017You must be one of Ilia's
mercenary knights.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah...
I'm Treck.@0003
@000C@0017I am Miledy.
Pleased to meet you.@0003
@0009You're...@0003
@000CYes...@0003
I am a Dragon Knight from Bern,
as you probably suspected.@0003
@0009@0017Oh, I see.@0003
@000C@0017What...@0003
What do you think of the fact that
a knight from Bern is fighting@0003
alongside you?@0003
@0009@0017Well...@0003
You know, so what?@0003
@000C@0017S... So what?@0003
@0009@0017It's not like people from Bern
have seven ears or anything.@0003
@000C@0017@0016...@0016
Well, yes, I only have two.@0003
@0009@0017See?@0003
We're all brothers and sisters,
you know?@0003
@000C@0017Do... you think so?@0003
@0009@0017Yup.@0003
[04A2]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@012E@0009Ahh...
That hurt.@0003
@000C@0017Is something wrong,
Sir Treck?@0003
@0009Hm?@0003
Um, you're...@0003
@000CMiledy.@0003
Is something wrong?@0003
@0009@0017Well...@0003
I was just sitting here watching
you fight.@0003
@000C@0017Watching me fight?@0003
@0009Yeah...
My neck aches now.@0003
@000C@0017I... see.@0003
@0009Yeah.
And I was kinda thinking...@0003
Maybe you have a loved one in
Bern?@0003
Like family or a lover or
something?@0003
@000C...N-No, that's not the case.
I live for Princess Guinevere...@0003
@0009@0017Oh, okay.
Yeah, I thought so.@0003
My assumptions are usually wrong.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016@0017Oh well, guess I hurt
my neck for nothing.@0003
[04A3]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@012E@0009Um, you're...@0003
@000C@0017...Miledy.@0003
Do you always forget
people's names?@0003
@0009@0017It's a hobby.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016You are an odd individual,
Sir Treck.@0003
@0009Do you think so?@0003
I think I'm pretty normal.@0003
Everyone tells me that they envy me
because I look like I have no worries@0003
or anything.@0003
I have my concerns too, you know.@0003
@000COh?
Like what?@0003
@0009Well, the other day I dreamed
I was a horse.@0003
@000C@0017...A horse.@0003
@0009@0017I think this dream has some kind
of hidden meaning somewhere...@0003
It's been bothering me for some
time now, and I've only been able@0003
to sleep at night.@0003
@000CWell...@0003
Thank you,
Sir Treck.@0003
@0009Huh?@0003
@000CI feel a little better now.@0003
@0009Really?
Why would that be?@0003
[04A4]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@012F@0009Whoa.@0003
@000CUh?@0003
@0009Hey, what's your name?@0003
@000C@0017I Gonzales.@0003
@0009@0017Gonzales?
My god, you're huge.@0003
And look at your build.@0003
You must be able to pull trees
right out of the ground.@0003
@000C@0017I...?@0003
@0009@0017Hm, this is quite a find.@0003
There's no way that I'm letting
you go.@0003
@000C@0017Uh...
What?@0003
@0016......@0016
...I go now.@0003
@0009Hey, wait a minute.@0003
[04A5]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@012F@0009Oh.@0003
@000CUh...@0003
@0009@0017Hey, wait!
@0017I need a favor from you.@0003
@000C@0017...Me?@0003
@0009@0017Right.
It has to be you.@0003
You see, there's going to be a new
village built on the Western Isles.@0003
@000C@0017Village...@0003
@0009@0017There are lots of people who
lost their homes in this war.@0003
There are even a lot of them from the
resistance group that I was with.@0003
@000C@0017Lost home...@0003
@0009@0017So we've decided to build a village
for those people.@0003
And we need help, you see.@0003
It'd be really great if we get some
strong men like you.@0003
What do you say?@0003
If you sign up now, you'll get
breakfast, lunch, and dinner,@0003
five days a week.@0003
@000C@0017But... I ugly...@0003
I can't stay with people.
They not like me...@0003
@0009@0017Haha, don't be ridiculous.@0003
Just try carrying in a couple of huge
logs with that strength of yours.@0003
Everyone'll love you.@0003
@000C@0017Love me...?@0003@0002
@0017I help you.@0003
[04A6]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@012F@0009Hey.@0003
@000C@0017Uh...@0003
What...
What's your name?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, right.
I hadn't told you yet.@0003
I'm...@0003@000C@0017No... I dumb.
I can't remember things...@0003
...And I ugly.
Everyone looks at me...@0003
I ugly, dumb...@0003
@0009...My, my.@0003
Look, Gonzales, you have to have
more confidence in yourself.@0003
Yeah, you have a scary face, and
you're a bit dumber than most others.@0003
But so what?@0003
@000CUh...?@0003
@0009All right, Gonzales.@0003
I won't say that 'As long as you
have a kind heart...' crap.@0003
You're ugly.@0003
People make fun of you because of
it.@0003
@000CUh...@0003
But that doesn't mean that you
should just give up.@0003
@0009@0017You should look over yourself carefully,
and find something that only you have.@0003
You'll eventually find something
that's unique to you.@0003
@000C@0017To me...@0003
@0009@0017Right, unique to you.@0003
If you have that, no one will
be making fun of you anymore.@0003
You won't have to belittle
yourself all the time.@0003
You can stand proud.@0003
@000CU...Unique...?@0003
@0016......@0016
@0017I go think.@0003@0006
My head hurts.@0003
@0009@0017Hahaha...
Take all the time you need.@0003
[04A7]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0131@0009@0017?@0003
@000C@0017Hmm...?@0003
Who are you?@0003
@0009@0017Me?@0003
I... I Gonzales.@0003
@000C@0017Gonzales?
That's a nice name...@0003
@0009@0017R-Really?@0003
@000C@0017I'm Treck.
Nice to meet you.@0003
@0009@0017T...T...?@0003
@000C@0017Treck.@0003
@0009@0017Treck Treck Treck Treck Tre...@0003
@000C@0017Haha, don't repeat it so
much like that.@0003
You're embarrassing me.@0003
@0009@0017Shut up.
I forget.@0003
...ck Treck Treck Tre...
Okay, I remember.@0003
@000C@0017Haha, you're an odd one.
Hey, are you...@0003
@0017...Um...@0003
Sorry, what was your name again?@0003
[04A8]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0131@0009@0017Uh?@0003
You, you...@0003
@000CHm...?@0003
@0009Who are you?
I see you before.@0003
@000C@0017Really?
I must be famous.@0003
My name is Treck.@0003
@0009@0017T...T...
T...?@0003
@000C...reck.@0003
@0009Reck.@0003
@000CYeah...@0003
Hey, what's your name?@0003
@0009@0017I Gonzales.@0003
@000C@0017Gonzales?
That's a nice name...@0003
@0009@0017R-Really?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah.@0003
It's really calm,
don't you think...?@0003
@0009@0017Calm...@0003
What's calm...?@0003
@000C@0017Hm? ...Hmm...@0003
You know, I don't really
know either.@0003
But hey, don't worry about it.@0003
It's nothing compared to the
size of this world.@0003
[04A9]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0131@000C@0017Ahhh...@0003
@0009Uh?@0003
@000C@0017It's so peaceful here...@0003
You know, we could make quite a
team, don't you think?@0003
Um...@0003
@0009@0017I Gonzales.@0003
@000C@0017Gonzales?
That's a nice name...@0003
Oh yeah, my name is...@0003
@0009@0017You Reck.@0003
@000C@0017Hm?
Was it?@0003
Now that you say so,
I think you're right.@0003
Well, no matter.
Let's go.@0003
@0009Yeah.@0003
[04AA]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0130@000C@0017General Zealot,
are you all right?@0009Ah, Noah.@0003
This is nothing.
We are knights of Ilia.@0003
We wouldn't lose to other nations'
knights in terms of battle experience.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
Well, I still have a lot to
learn, though.@0003
@0009Hm.@0003
...Oh.@0003
Noah, have you written your letter
yet?@0003
@000CLetter?
Oh...that letter.@0003
@0009Right.@0003
Remember what you were told
when you first joined?@0003
There are Pegasus Knight messengers
that fly with us.@0003
If he should fall in battle,
they will deliver our letters for us.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
@0009Neither of us will be able to meet
our deaths peacefully in bed.@0003
The letters are essential to us.@0003
Noah, don't you have anyone
you want to send a letter to?@0003
@000CWell... Not really.@0003
I do recall my comrades were
writing letters, though.@0003
They were addressing them to
their parents.. .or lovers.@0003
@0009You should do the same.@0003
Why don't you get a girlfriend
yourself?@0003
@000CWell, I'll think about it.@0003
[04AB]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0130@000C@0017...General Zealot.@0003
@0009Is it about the letter?@0003
Have you changed your mind?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
I suppose even I have someone I want
to send a letter to when I die.@0003
If I die, I want you to read my
letter.@0003
@0009Me?@0003
@000CTreck and I...
And also Grant and Sieks...@0003
We all made it here thanks
to you.@0003
I'd like to express my
gratitude to you when I die.@0003
@0009...I see.@0003
@000CSpeaking of the others...
I wonder where they are now?@0003
@0009I've no idea.@0003
But they were once under my command.
They won't die so easily.@0003
@000CI heard that some were hired
by Bern...@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
But that can't be helped.@0003
We give our blood and get money
in return.@0003
@000C...General Zealot,
what do you think of that?@0003
@0009Of what?@0003
@000CNobles from other nations say
that Ilia sells death for a living.@0003
They say that we are vultures
attracted to blood and decaying meat.@0003
@0009That doesn't bother me.@0003
It's a fact that Ilia couldn't
survive without war.@0003
We are giving our own blood
as well to survive.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
[04AC]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0130
@000C@0017General Zealot?@0003
Is something wrong?@0003
@0009Ah, Noah.@0003
No...nothing's wrong.
Did I seem troubled?@0003
@000CNo.@0003
I just thought that
something had happened.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
...A letter arrived today.
It was your comrade's...@0003
Grant's will.@0003
@000C...I see.@0003
@0009Would you like to read it?@0003
@000C...No.@0003
@0009All right.@0003
Then let's go.@0003
@000CYes.@0003
[04AD]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@0130@0009...Zzz...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016...Uh...@0003
Oh, Noah...
You were there?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I've been here for
a while now.@0003
Well, I'm used to it, so I don't mind
you falling asleep every ten seconds.@0003
But you know, don't you have anything
else to do?@0003
@0009@0017Like what?@0003
@000C@0017Like practicing your swings during
marches, or something.@0003
@0009@0017Well...
How about you?@0003
Have you been doing anything?@0003
@000C@0017Me?
...Not really.@0003
...I guess I'm no different from
you, then.@0003
Hey, what were you doing back
in Ilia during the break?@0003
@0009@0017I slept.@0003
@000C@0017I mean other than that.@0003
@0009@0017Well...
Oh, I went fishing.@0003
You know how the lakes freeze
over in the winter?@0003
You punch holes in the ice with your
spear and lower some string inside.@0003
@000CSounds exactly like something you
would do.@0003
What can you catch?@0003
@0009Nothing.@0003
It's just fun to sit there staring
off into space holding the string.@0003
@000C...You really live life to the
fullest.@0003
@0009What were you doing?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017...Nothing much, really.@0003
[04AE]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@0130@000CTreck, do you remember Casis?@0003
@0009Casis?@0003
Hmm...@0003
I sort of remember that name...@0003
@000C@0017You don't remember?@0003
He's the guy that forgot to bring
his weapons to our first mission.@0003
@0009Oh, right!@0003
He was getting scolded with me
by General Zealot.@0003
He even forgot to bring his horse,
you know.@0003
He was fighting on foot!@0003
I never thought there'd be someone
dumber than me in our squad.@0003
@000C@0017Well, he's dead.@0003
He was hired by Bern...
He died close to here.@0003
@0009...Oh.@0003
@000CMercenaries are in high demand
right now...@0003
We could have ended up fighting
him if we were unlucky.@0003
@0009Well...@0003
@0017We're for hire, you know.
It happens.@0003
@000C@0017Well, I guess you're right...@0003
I really envy that personality
of yours...@0003
[04AF]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@0130
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Hmm?
Something wrong, Noah?@0003
@000C@0017No...@0003
I was just thinking some things
over.@0003
@0009@0017Thinking things over?
Don't bother.@0003
We're not made to be thinking
deeply like that.@0003
@000C@0017...I guess.@0003
You know, this war...@0003
I mean, I never meant to go out and
save the world or anything, but we've@0003
fought through a lot of battles.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah.@0003
@000C@0017But Ilia's the same as always.
Our kids, and our kids' kids...@0003
They'll be fighting to make a living,
just like we do.@0003
I was just wondering...
Couldn't we do anything?@0003
@0009@0017I wonder...@0003
@000C@0017Maybe it's just futile for us
to try and make a difference...@0003
@0009@0017Well...
That's all right, too.@0003
@000CIt is...?@0003
@0009Yeah.
At least I think so.@0003
We go through hard times, but
isn't that all part of life?@0003
@000C...Maybe so.@0003
...Hey, Treck.@0003
@0009Yeah?@0003
@000CTake me along the next
time you go fishing.@0003
[04B0]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0131@0009@0017Treck.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Treck?@0003
@000C...Zzz...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Oww!?@0003
What...what the?
How come my head hurts so much?@0003
@0009Because I just hit you.@0003
@000CHuh?
General Zealot?@0003
@0009Treck, you were sleeping
on the job again.@0003
@000CYeah...sorry, sir.
I couldn't help it...@0003
Yawn...@0003
@0009Never fails, does it?@0003
You just go right to sleep
whenever there's the chance.@0003
What's more, you're more troublesome
because you sleep with your eyes open.@0003
@000CYeah... thanks.@0003
@0009I've been meaning to tell you this for
a long time, but you lack discipline.@0003
I'll be checking on you regularly
from now on.@0003
@000CYes sir...@0003
Yawn...@0003
[04B1]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0131@000C@0017...Zzz...@0003
@0009Treck...@0003
@000C...Zzz...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Owww!?@0003
@0017Uh... General Zealot?
Yawn...@0003
Good morning, sir.@0003
@0009@0017Treck...@0003
There are rumors going around
in the army about you.@0003
They say that the Ilian Knight Treck
is swinging his sword in his sleep!@0003
@000C@0017I have yet to accomplish that,
sir.@0003
...But that does seem like fun.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016@0017Treck, you've got talent.
Why don't you do your job properly?@0003
@000CWell...@0003
@0009We are members of the proud
Ilian Mercenary Knights.@0003
This is a battle that will determine
the world's fate...@0003
And to us, that isn't all.@0003
The reputation of the Ilian Mercenary
Knights will be determined by our@0003
actions and how we fight in this
battle.@0003
That shall have a great impact
on the future of Ilia, and thus...@0003
@000C@0017...Zzz...@0003
[04B2]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0131@0009@0017Treck, are you awake?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, sir.@0003
@0009@0017You're actually awake?
What a pleasant surprise.@0003
@000C@0017Well, I have my moments,
too.@0003
@0009@0017I see.@0003
Treck...
You've done well.@0003
@000CHuh?@0003
@0009We couldn't have come this far
without you.@0003
It is all thanks to you.@0003
You can sleep as much as you
want from now on.@0003
@000CWell...@0003@0009@0011@000C@0011@0007
...Treck!@0003
@000C@0010@0131
@0009You were sleeping again!@0003
@000C@0017Huh?
Eh?
General Zealot?@0003
@0009@0017How many times do I have
to tell you?@0003
You should be more...@0003
@000C@0017...Good morning, sir.@0003
[04B3]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@0135@0009Hey, you.@0003
@000CYeah?@0003
@0009You can drive a ship, right?
I want to ask a favor.@0003
@000CFrom me?@0003
@0009Yeah.@0003
We're planning on building
a new village on the Western Isles.@0003
What I want you to do is use your
ship to carry the people there.@0003
I'll pay you well.@0003
@000C@0017...A ship, huh?@0003
@0009@0017What's the matter?
You can drive one, right?@0003
@000C...Yeah, I sure can.@0003
I was once the captain of a
trading vessel.@0003
There's no ocean I haven't
seen yet.@0003
@0009@0017...Then why did you become
a pirate?@0003
@000CI couldn't continue my business
in this war.@0003
We had no choice, so I persuaded
the boys saying that we were@0003
going to be pirates.@0003
@0009Uh-huh.@0003
@000C@0017But we were originally just
ordinary seafarers.@0003
We don't like fighting or robbing
or any of that stuff.@0003
Anyway, when we were prepared and
finally set off as pirates,@0003
everyone started complaining of
stomach aches and seasickness@0003
and everything.@0003
@0009@0017Well, well.
It's amazing you got this far.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, well, I wasn't doing
it because I liked it...@0003
[04B4]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@0135@000C@0017Even if I say we were pirates,
we were just amateurs.@0003
...We figured we'd go for easy targets
first, so we picked a small trading@0003
ship for our first one.@0003
We were able to take over most of
most of the ship without a fight,@0003
but...@0003
@0009@0017But what?@0003
@000C@0017We couldn't find any treasure
at all.@0003
The captain of the ship told me that he
was in the same situation that I was.@0003
He said that he wasn't doing well
either, so he might have to resort@0003
to piracy as well...@0003
@0009@0017And?@0003
@000CWe let them go.@0003
I couldn't steal from them
after hearing that.@0003
@0009A nice pirate, eh?
How ever would you survive?@0003
@000C...Yeah, that's what I thought, too.@0003
So anyway, we decided to go after
a bigger ship next.@0003
We figured we could steal from
the rich and no one would be hurt.@0003
A few days later, we were lucky
enough to come across a large@0003
trading vessel.@0003
@0009Yeah?@0003
@000CWe didn't have to hold back
this time.@0003
We charged the ship... but when
we got close, suddenly the enemy@0003
ship started swarming with ballistaes
and archers.
It was one of Bern's battleships.@0003
@0009@0017My, my.@0003
@000C@0017We were shot at mercilessly, and
they chased us for 3 days and nights.@0003
We somehow got away, but the
ship was wrecked.@0003
We weren't making any money, either.
Some of the boys started crying.@0003
Hell, even I felt like crying at
that time.@0003
@0009Poor thing.@0003
@000C@0017Well like I said, I wasn't
doing it because I liked it...@0003
[04B5]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@0135@0009@0017Hm?@0003
What's that?
A map?@0003
@000C@0017It's the one trophy that
I've gotten so far as a pirate.@0003
I found it when we were
battling another band.@0003
@0009@0017I see.@0003
@000C@0017See the skull mark here?@0003
It means there's treasure buried
there.@0003
@0009And did you find it?@0003
@000CI don't have any money left.@0003
Once this war ends, I'll be
a merchant again.@0003
If what this map says is true, I
can go get the treasure and@0003
@0017travel the seas once again.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000CI don't have any money left.@0003
I even went into debt to feed
the guys.@0003
It this map's a fake, then I'll
have to let go of my ship forever.@0003
...I can't help but hesitate when
I think of that possibility.@0003
@0009Uh huh.@0003
@0017But you know that no amount of praying
and worrying is gonna get you that@0003
treasure, right?@0003
You have to take action.@0003
@000C@0017...Yeah.
You're right.@0003
@0009@0017Even if that map's a fake, there'll
be other treasures out there.@0003
Anyway, you're helping us out by
carrying the residents to our new@0003
village, right?@0003
I'm counting on you.
Show me your ship sometime.@0003
@000CYou got it.
You can count on me.@0003
[04B6]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@0122@0009Lilina, is your magic
improving?@0003
@000CYes, I think I've been getting
better since you taught me@0003
those basics.@0003
@0009Good.@0003
You have a special gift for
magic, Lilina.@0003
If you practice, you'll become
a great mage like no other.@0003
@000C@0017Me...?@0003
@0009@0017Yes.@0003
So make sure you keep up with
your training.@0003
@000CYes!@0003
[04B7]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@0122@000C@0017General Cecilia, why didn't you
teach magic to Roy?@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
@000CWhen Roy was studying in Ostia,
you wouldn't teach him magic at@0003
all, no matter how much he asked.@0003
@0009Ah... You're right.
I didn't.@0003
@000C@0017Why didn't you?@0003
You taught it to me a great deal.@0003
@0009@0017That's partly because of you.@0003
@000C@0017Because of me?@0003
@0009@0017Right.@0003
Roy... you know how he is.@0003
If I taught him magic, he would have
practiced and practiced to master it.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, you're right.
But...@0003
@0009@0017You see, practice isn't enough to
master a school of magic.@0003
You need talent, and that can't
be obtained through mere training.@0003
What would Roy think if there was
a person with that talent right@0003
near him?@0003
He's working as hard...@0003
No, probably even harder than
that person, but he's still@0003
lagging far behind.@0003
What would he feel like?@0003@000C@0017That person...
Is it me?@0003
@0009@0017People have things that they're
naturally good at.@0003
It was clear that Roy wouldn't do
very well with magic, so I figured@0003
that he would be better off mastering
the sword.@0003
@000C@0016.....@0003
@0009@0016Lilina, you will eventually lead
Ostia's future.@0003
Remember this...@0003
If you assign someone to a task that
he is naturally not good at, he will@0003
waste his ability.@0003
You must never think that everyone
works in the same way.@0003@000C@0017Yes...@0003
[04B8]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@0122@000CGeneral Cecilia, don't you think
Roy changed recently?@0003
@0009In what way?@0003
@000CHe's gotten calmer...@0003
Or rather, he's more confident when
he's giving commands to the army.@0003
You would naturally become like that if
you were in charge of an entire army.@0003
If Roy didn't grow, the army itself
would be in danger.@0003General Cecilia, you said the other
day that I would be leading Ostia's@0003
future.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
After all, you are Lord Hector's
only heir.@0003
@000C@0017Do you think I could be
like Roy?@0003
I mean...@0003
I couldn't even recognize a
Traitor in my own castle...@0003
@0009@0017People grow according to their
potential.@0003
Even me, I didn't know what I would
do when I was pulled from Ostia to@0003
Aquleia and was told that I would
be Etruria's Sorcery General.@0003
@000C@0017But you were able to
succeed because of your ability..@0003
@0009@0017That's not true.@0003
I was only able to come this far
thanks to Percival and Lord Douglas.@0003
You're thinking that you have to do
everything on your own, aren't you?@0003
@000C@0017Oh...@0003
@0009@0017Even Roy isn't fighting on his own,
you know.@0003
He's putting faith in the people
around him.@0003
That is another important attribute
for a person in power.@0003
So you can depend on people when
you want to, too.@0003
@000C@0017Even you?@0003
@0009@0017Of course.@0003
I'll be glad to offer
you help when you need it.@0003
@000CYes!@0003

@0007@0080@0004@000C@0013What!
That's awful!@0003
@0009@0014But Zephiel was very patient.@0003
He said that he did not mind even if
he did not gain the throne.@0003
But the people around us, who were
looking forward to Zephiel's ability@0003
to be a good king, would not allow
anyone else to be the heir.@0003
Pressured by the public, our father
lost his patience at last, and...@0003
@000C@0013Decided to kill King Zephiel...?@0003
@0009@0014At a banquet, our father gave Zephiel
a poisoned drink from his own hands.@0003
And that was the first and last cup
that Zephiel ever took from our father.@0003
After returning to his room, Zephiel
started to get sick.@0003
For 10 days and nights, Zephiel lingered
between life and death.@0003
But Murdock, Zephiel's teacher and
loyal general, saved his life.@0003
@000C... The former king never did
anything after that?@0003
@0009No...@0003
But I have heard that he had plans
to get rid of Murdock and Zephiel's@0003
mother as traitors.@0003
He was scheming to murder them all
along with Zephiel.@0003
After hearing that, Zephiel made
believe he was dead.@0003
Our father then checked the coffin to
confirm Zephiel's death.@0003
At that moment, Zephiel rose up from
the coffin and...with his sword...@0003
@0009@0014@0016I was but a child then, so
naturally I could not have@0003
understood what was going on.@0003
All I knew is that after our father 
died, Zephiel never smiled again.@0003
Until then, he was strict at times,
but always a kind and loving brother@0003
to me. So...@0003
@000C@0012Princess..@0003
@0009@0014So from that moment forward,
I knew I had to take action.@0003
@000C@0013I... see...@0003@0080@0004
@0009@0014... But now Zephiel is at a place
where he can never hear me.@0003
Roy, please...
Please stop him.@0003
Please stop him from inflicting
pain and suffering to the people@0003
of Bern and the people of other
of other nations.@0003
@000CEven if it may resolve to
the blade?@0003
@0009...I have made my resolve when
I entrusted this task to you.@0003
@000CI see.@0003
You have my word and loyalty,
Princess Guinevere.@0003
I swear to the Fire Emblem
that I will stop King Zephiel!@0003

@0009Still, I would not be able to create
actual things like the Dark Dragon can.@0003
@000CSo you found Zephiel.@0003
@0009Right.@0003
I found Zephiel and asked him,
'Why did you break the Dark Dragon's@0003
seal?'@0003
Zephiel was an odd man.@0003
He didn't seem to be the least bit
surprised.@0003
He looked me right back in the eye
and asked me who I was.@0003
After I told him that I was a Dragon,
he started to smile mysteriously.@0003
He then said,
'My intentions are to give the@0003
the world to your kind.'@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009I cannot say that I fully trusted him,
but he was still the Dark Dragon's@0003
new master, so I decided to work
with him.@0003
Zephiel then ordered the Dark Dragon to
lead the world in the place of foolish@0003
humans.@0003
@000CBut Zephiel is dead.
What is the Dark Dragon doing now?@0003
@0009Although he is gone,
the Dark Dragon resides in the@0003
chamber behind me.@0003
She is waiting for the chance
to free the world.@0003
@000CBut her master is gone!
Are you her new master?@0003
@0009I did not need to become her master.@0003
She was commanded to carry out
Zephiel's orders even if he were@0003
to die.@0003
Idoun has absolute obedience to
her master.@0003
She will make sure that humans are
banished from this land.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
Her heart was destroyed,
and now she's bound to orders@0003
given by a person long dead?@0003
@0009Do you feel pity, like Hartmut
did?@0003
...You humans are truly difficult
to understand.@0003
But let me tell you this.@0003
No matter how hard you try, humans
and Dragons will never be able to@0003
live in harmony.@0003
The gap between species is
impossible to fill.@0003
@000CThat's not true!@0003
I know a place where Dragons and humans
are living together.@0003
Dragons and humans were both brought
into the same world.@0003
They can, and will, understand each
other!@0003
@0009Dragons and humans,
living together in harmony?@0003
Rubbish.@0003
I have no intention of
listening to such nonsense.@0003
Now, enter my domain.
Let us see who has more power!@0003

@000CIt didn't die?@0003
@0009Yes, apparently the sword reacted to
its wielder's feelings and changed its@0003
power accordingly.@0003
@000CSo Hartmut didn't want to kill
it, so the Sword of Seals@0003
reacted to his emotions and only@0003
knocked the Dark Dragon unconscious?@0003
@0009I understand that Hartmut did know a
little bit about the Dark Dragon.@0003
And then seeing her as the little girl
Idoun, he must have felt pity for her.@0003
It is another emotion that we Dragons
cannot comprehend.@0003
@000CPity...@0003
@0009And thus at the bottom of his heart
he didn't want to kill her.@0003
In my opinion, I would never leave something
that would be a danger to me alive.@0003
@000CSo Hartmut's heart
changed the sword's strength...@0003
@0009Hartmut persuaded his comrades and decided
to seal the Dark Dragon.@0003
He built a temple deep in the forests of
Bern and sealed Idoun away using the@0003
sword and a gemstone.@0003
They are what you call the Sword of
Seals and the Fire Emblem.@0003
He then created a nation near the temple
that would watch over and protect the seal@0003
from being broken.@0003
They are the ancestors of Zephiel.@0003
@000C...How do you know all this?
Were you watching?@0003
@0009No.@0003
I had been deeply wounded, so I was
leading a hidden life healing myself.@0003
I heard the story about the seal
from Zephiel.@0003
Although he said that he read it in
the ancient scrolls that are kept in@0003
the court library.@0003
@000CHow did you meet Zephiel?@0003
@0009With him?@0003
Hm... If you reach me,
I will tell you.@0003

@000CBut what about the time when
you came to aid us in Ostia?@0003
@0009That event was an exception
because Percival worked with me.@0003
But now...@0003
@000CPlease don't worry yourself..@0003
We can return to Lycia when we
complete this mission anyway.@0003
But may I ask you to take care
of Lycia while we are away?@0003
@0009Of course.@0003
You can leave the Lycia Alliance, and
also Princess Guinevere, to me.@0003@0011
@0008@0010@0157Roy...
I may not go with you?@0003
@000CThe battles on these islands
are likely to become slugfests.@0003
You can never know what
will happen.@0003
I think you should hide in Etruria
with protection from General Cecilia.@0003
@001C
@000A@0010@0134Your Highness, please trust me.
I understand your intentions of@0003
suggesting a truce, and I also promised
Roy that I would protect you.@0003
Trust me, I will defend
you at all costs.@0003@001C
@0008...I understand.
I apologize for being selfish.@0003
Roy, I pray
for your safety.@0003
@000C@0017Thank you, my Lady.
I will pray for yours as well.@0003

@000C@0012@0016......@0003
@0009@0010@0157@0014@0016I was but a child then, so
naturally I could not have@0003
understood what was going on.@0003
All I knew is that after our father 
died, Zephiel never smiled again.@0003
Until then, he was strict at times,
but always a kind and loving brother@0003
to me. So...@0003
@000C@0012Princess..@0003
@0009@0014So from that moment forward,
I knew I had to take action.@0003
@000C@0013I... see...@0003@0080@0004
@0009@0014... But now Zephiel is at a place
where he can never hear me.@0003
Roy, please...
Please stop him.@0003
Please stop him from inflicting
pain and suffering to the people@0003
of Bern and the people of other
of other nations.@0003
@000CEven if it may resolve to
the blade?@0003
@0009... I have made my resolve when
I entrusted this task to you.@0003
@000CI see.@0003
You have my word and loyalty,
Princess Guinevere.@0003
I swear to the Fire Emblem
that I will stop King Zephiel!@0003

@000C@0080@000DWhat!?
Then Lycia would be in danger!@0003
@000D@0010@0154M-Master Roy!@0003
@0008Your country could be in peril.@0003
Are you sure you want to be wasting
your time on a little island like this?@0003
@000DHe's right!@0003
If Bern wanted us to get away from
Lycia so they could invade,@0003
then we must go back at once...@0003
@000B...I'm not going back.@0003@001C
@000DWhat!? Why!?@0003@001C
@0008@0016......@0016@0003
@000BRight now, it's very difficult
to judge what information@0003
is true and what is false.@0003
In times like this, the worst thing
to do is to jump to information@0003
presented in front of you and taking
action based on it.@0003
Sure, I'm worried about Lycia,
but my father is there, and@0003
General Cecilia is also watching
over Lycia.@0003
But only our army is on these islands.@0003@001C
@000DThat's true, but...@0003@001C
@000BIf we just leave without fully
clearing out the bandits,@0003
then what we did so far
would all be a lie...@0003
@0008...I see you are blessed
with a wise leader.@0003
@000BWhat?@0003
@0008Master Roy,
I am so sorry I tried you so.@0003@001C
@000DTried us!?
So what you said was a lie!?@0003@001C
@0008I have not lied.@0003
But I did present the rumor in such
a way that you would easily@0003
jump onto it.@0003
But Master Roy kept his head.@0003
I feel that I would like to join
an individual like you.@0003
Master Roy,
please count me among your ranks.@0003
@000B...I don't like the idea that
you were testing us, but if@0003
@0017you're willing to help,
then we'll welcome you.@0003
@0008@0017Then...@0003
@000B@0017Yes,
please fight alongside us.@0003
@0017Well then,
back to business.@0003
What can we do to help the
people on these isles?@0003
@0008Head south...
towards Caledonia.@0003
@000BWhy?@0003
@0008Castle Idina is located there,
where the people being sent@0003
to Mt.Ebrakhm are kept.@0003
@000BAll right,
then let's save those people first!@0003@0006
@0008Master Roy,
please take this sword.@0003
@000BWhat is this?@0003
@0008It is a sword called the
Wyrmslayer.@0003
I hear it was created during the
Scouring to use against Dragons.@0003
@000BWyrmslayer?@0003
This isn't a Divine Weapon?@0003
@0008No.@0003
The Divine Weapons can only be used
by those who have skill equal to the@0003
Eight Heroes.@0003
But this weapon should be useable@0003
by people of this army as well.@0003

@000CIt can make more Dragons...@0003
@0009The Dark Dragon can make more of
its kind.@0003
That would explain where Bern is
getting all of its Dragons.@0003
@000CThat is possible.@0003
@0009Now, that being said...@0003
I want to learn more about the Dragons.
Let me accompany your travels.@0003
@0014I wield Dark Magic...
I'm sure I can be of some assistance.@0003
@000COf course.@0003@0002
We want to learn about the Dragons
as well.@0003
It may be dangerous, but if that's
okay with you, you're welcome to@0003
join us.@0003
[07CA]

@000B@0013Then they should be
powerful allies.@0003
@0009@0014Yes!
Fortune is still with us,@0003
Master Roy!@0003
But...
I heard from the mercenary@0003
knights that one of the Three
Dragon Lords is coming here@0003
with a legion of Dragon Knights.@0003
If they should join the rebels,
then our chances of defeating them@0003
would become extremely slim.@0003@001C
@000D@0013Roy... what are you going to do?@0003@001C
@000B@0014...The Kingdom of Etruria
might join us.@0003@001C
@000D@0013Etruria?!
Would that be possible?@0003@001C
@000BGeneral Cecilia, the Sorcery General of
Etruria was my teacher in battle arts@0003
while I was studying in Ostia.@0003
I have a feeling that she would be
willing to join forces with us.@0003
@0009I would object, Master Roy!@0003
If we depend on Etruria to solve our
own matters in Lycia, we'll be@0003
sure to be their laughing
stock for decades!@0003
@000BYes, I know that...@0003
But this is truly an important
matter for Lycia.@0003
I think that we should go
for the safest and most@0003
definite option rather than
worry about the@0003
consequences and do nothing,
which would most likely@0003
lead to the extinction of Lycia.@0003
@0009... Master Roy.@0003
@000BWe have to move quickly!
I'll write a letter to General Cecilia.@0003
Merlinus, I need you to get the letter
to her as quickly as possible.@0003
@0009...Yes, Master Roy!
You are right.@0003
I shall send the letter to her@0003
as soon as you are ready.@0003
@000BThanks.@0003
All right, everybody!
Let's retake Ostia!@0003

Bern surrendered.@0003
[0938]
Roy traversed underground passageway that
the Eight Heroes used to make their way@0003
to the Dragon Temple.@0003
[0939]
However, Brenya, the last remaining
Dragon Lord of Bern, stood before him.@0003
[093A]
Bern as a nation was gone,
but its spirit was@0003
[093B]
not dead yet...@0003
[093C]
Roy had a heavy heart at
having to fight these ghosts...@0003
[093D]
Etruria
[093E]
Etruria was the other powerful kingdom
along with Bern. After debating about@0003
[093F]
about Guinevere's and Roy's position,
the Etrurian Court decided that they@0003
[0940]
had no reason to attack Bern as they
had not suffered a direct offense.@0003
[0941]
Guinevere was to stay under Etrurian
Protection at the Capital of Aquleia,@0003
[0942]
and the Lycia Alliance Army was to be
an independent squad under the Etrurian@0003
[0943]
military. To test his worth, Etruria
sent Roy to the Western Isles, where@0003
[0944]
his mission was to rid the islands of
the bandits terrorizing the people.@0003
[0945]
The Western Isles is an archipelago
under Etrurian protection lying to@0003
[0946]
the west of the mainland. Many
mining corporations have sprouted up@0003
[0947]
trying to monopolize the rich minerals
that lie in the islands' soil. However,@0003
the riches attracted many bandits, and the
people lived in constant fear of them...@0003
[0948]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@014D
@000C@0013@0017Have you not found that bard
of the resistance force?@0003
@0009@0014We are still searching
for him, my lord.@0003
@000C@0013And?@0003
@0009@0014It appears he has hidden
himself in a village on the@0003
outskirts of the castle...@0003
@000C@0014The resistance group is
just another band without@0003
that Elphin supporting them
with his brains.@0003
I don't care what happens to
the village, just find him!@0003
@0009@0012Yes, my lord.@0003@0011
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0014@0017Ah, I apologize for keeping
you waiting, my lady.@0003
@0009@0013@0017You seemed...
busy.@0003
@000C@0014@0017Oh no, we prioritize allying
with Bern above all things.@0003
So if you need anything...@0003
@0009@0013@0017Then, as I asked earlier...@0003
@000C@0014@0017Ah, the whereabouts
of Princess Guinevere.@0003
@0009@0013@0017Do you have any
information, Lord Zinc?@0003
@000C@0014I regret to say
that I do not.@0003
You have already visited
the capital at Djuto?@0003
@0009@0012Yes.@0003
@000C@0014@0017Then I suggest you pay
a visit to Bishop Oro.@0003
He resides in the castle,@0003
overlooking Mt. Ebrakhm to the north.
He knows this region better than any@0003
of us, so I would believe he'd have
some ideas.@0003
However, if even he does not know
where Princess Guinevere is, then@0003
I would think she is not on these
islands.@0003
@0009@0013@0017I see.@0003
I will talk with
Bishop Oro.@0003
Thank you
for your time.@0003
@0011
[0949]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017The rebel group is supposed
to be very active in these areas.@0003
@0009Yes, according to
our sources.@0003
But I also understand that earlier
this week, the resistance@0003
group was hunted down by
Etruria's military.@0003
I heard that they were
devastated.@0003
@000C...The Etrurian government lets
the bandits go and opresses@0003
the resistance group who are
trying to help the people.@0003
It doesn't look good...@0003
@0009No, it does not.@0003
@000CCould we do anything
to help?@0003
@0009That would be difficult..@0003
We would be going against
Etruria's nobility.@0003
I don't think that would be
a good idea when we are working@0003
under Etruria's orders.@0003
@000CI'll send a messenger to
General Cecilia and see what@0003
she has to say.@0003
We probably shouldn't do anything
too risky right now, but...@0003@0009@0011
@0008@0010@0152@0014Master Roy!@0003
Lord Zinc who controls this area
is sending out troops to attack@0003
the villages to find a member
of the resistance force!@0003@0011
@0009@0010@0154@0013What!
...Should we?@0003
@000C@0014We don't have time to wait
for General Cecilia's reply...@0003
But I want to help the people.@0003
...Even if it means going
against Etruria's orders.@0003
@0009Master Roy...@0003
@000CLet's fight!@0003
So we can be proud
when we return to Lycia!@0003
[094A]
@0009@0010@0136@000C@0010@012E
@0009@0017Well, were you able to find out
where Princess Guinevere is?@0003
@000CNo.@0003
But I heard a bishop named Oro
in charge of the mines in the north@0003
might know.@0003
@0009@0013All right,
then let's head north.@0003
@000C@0014Gale... I'm sorry.@0003
King Zephiel wanted to keep the case
on Guinevere in secercy, so he only@0003
assigned my group to look for her.@0003
I'm sorry I got you mixed up into
this...@0003
@0009You shouldn't worry yourself
over things like that.@0003
@000CBut you're one of the captains
working directly under General Murdock.@0003
@0009General Murdock has agreed to my helping
you out.@0003
In fact, he wants me to find out the
location of the Princess and the Fire Emblem.@0003
@000C...Do you think that Princess
Guinevere has the Fire Emblem?@0003
@0009Well, that's the what the
royalty thinks.@0003
And I think they're correct,
looking at the situation.@0003
@000C@0016@0012......@0003
@0009@0016@0014Come on,
don't look like that...@0003
Probably Princess Guinevere
has a plan of some sort.@0003
Come, let's go.@0003
@000C@0012Yes...@0003
[094B]
@000C@0010@012B@000C@0012@0017...Where...am I..?@0003
@0009@0010@015A@0013@0017Are you awake?@0003
@000C@0012@0017...What...happened...
to me...@0003
@0009@0014@0017We found you lying at the
entrance of the village, all@0003
brusied and blood-splattered.@0003
So we brought you home and
treated your wounds.@0003
@000C@0012@0017And you are...?@0003
@0009@0013@0017I'm Mary.
I live here.@0003
@000C@0014@0017...Live here...@0006No!@0003
This village will be
endangered if I stay here..@0003
...Or maybe it's too late
if it's already been one day..@0003
@0009@0012?@0003
@000C@0014I am Elphin...
One of the resistance group.@0003
The landowner is sure to send
troops here to capture me.@0003
@0009The resistance group...@0003
@000CMiss Mary,
you should run from here.@0003
This village is in danger.@0003
@0009@0013@0017...No,
I will stay.@0003
@000C@0012@0017...Why?@0003
@0009@0014@0017I have a younger brother.@0003
Right now he's gone out to look
for work with his friend from@0003
next door.@0003
His friend asked me to take
care of his younger sister@0003
while they was gone.@0003
@000C@0013@0017I see...@0003
Then all I can do to protect
this village is leave.@0003
Thank you very much
for healing my wounds.@0003
Please take care.@0003
@0009@0013@0017Yes, you take
care too.@0003
[094C]
@000C@0010@014D@0009@0010@01D7
@000C@0017What is the matter?@0003
Why is taking so long to find one
resistance group member?!@0003
@0009The Lycia Alliance Army!@0003
They are fighting to protect
the villagers...@0003
@000CThe Alliance Army?@0003
They would go against Etruria?!@0003
@0009We have gotten a message from Djuto.
It says,@0003
"The Lycia Alliance Army is suspected
to be working with the bandits.@0003
Capture them, or kill them,
if necessary."@0003
@000C@0017Oh?
Tied in with the bandits?@0003
How ironic!@0003
So they want to kill them to
save their own skins...@0003
@0009@0017What, sir?@0003
@000CThis is not the mainland.
Might makes right here.@0003
@0009I'm not quite sure
I understand...@0003
@000CDon't worry about it then.@0003
Is that all they said from
Djuto?@0003
@0009No.@0003
Lord Arcard has provided
us with reinforcements.@0003
@000CWhat!@0003
@0009They should be arriving soon.@0003
@000CDamn!@0003
Even if we defeat the Lycia
Alliance Army, we will not@0003
get all the credit if we are
aided by reinforcements!@0003
We need to do this quickly..@0003
Ah, of course!
Get Scollan!@0003
@0009Yes sir.@0003@0011@0006
@000A@0010@0151Yeah?@0003
What can I do for you,
Master Zinc?@0003
@000C@0014I want you to burn down
all the villages in this area.@0003
Kill the villagers as well.@0003
@000A...What if there's
treasure?@0003
@000C@0013Do with it as you wish.
Just hurry.@0003
@000A@0017Got it, Master Zinc.
Hehehehe...@0003
[094D]
@000C@0010@0151@0013@0017Gonzales!
Where's Gonzales!@0003
@0009@0010@012FHere...
I here...@0003
@000CThere's a village to the south.
You got that?@0003
@0009@0012Get it.@0003
@000C@0014That might be a hidden base
for the resistance forces.@0003
Master Zinc says to burn it down,
village and all.@0003
@0009@0012Village and all...@0003
@000C@0014Right.
Now git!@0003
A stupid hulk like you only comes in
use at times like this.@0003
You better not screw up.@0003
@0009@0013I...I...@0003
@000CYou got a problem?@0003
@0009N-No...@0003@0011@0006
@000C@0014Heh, he looks like hell,
but has that damn kind heart.@0003
He shouldn't be scared of
busting up one tiny village.@0003@0002
You guys,
you got that too?@0003
@0009@0010@0150@0012Sure thing, boss!@0003
[094E]
@000C@0010@010D@0017So that's the
Lycia Alliance Army...@0003
@0009@0010@0128They're supposed to be fighting
against the bandits...@0003
@000CI know.@0003
But Lord Arcard says that they
are fighting with the bandits@0003
to attack the villagers.@0003
Why are they doing the opposite
of what they were told to do...@0003
@0009.....@0003
@000CTate, can you take your troops and
attack from the north?@0003
I'll start attacking from here.@0003
@0009Yes sir.@0003@0011
@000CTate!
Wait.@0003
@0009@0010@0128Yes?@0003
@000C@0017I see that you have some
siblings.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
I have two sistersア
one older, one younger.@0003
@000CAre they all Pegasus Knights
like yourself?@0003
@0009Yes.
Why do you ask?@0003
@000CWell, actually, I have a
younger sister myself...@0003
@0009She must be very beautiful
if she is your sister.@0003
@000C@0017Thank you.
And yes, she is pretty.@0003
But I've heard she got tangled
up in some mess and I don't know@0003
where she is now..@0003
@0009What?
Oh my..@0003
@000CI've sent out some people to look
but they haven't found her yet.@0003
If only I wasn't on this mission,
I could go look myself..@0003
@0009@0016.....@0016@0003
@000CTate, take care of yourself.
For your family's sake.@0003
@0009Yes,@0005
thank you.@0003
[094F]
@000C@0010@010D@0009@0010@01D7
@000C@0017All right, let's go.@0003
@0009Sir, are you sure?@0003
@000CAbout what?@0003
@0009Lord Arcard said to leave most
of the fighting up to Ilia's@0003
Pegasus Knights so that we
the Etrurian army, suffer the@0003
least casulaties.@0003

@000CDon't be ridiculous,
they are trustworthy companions.@0003
We will attack at the same time...
or even before them.@0003
Understood?@0003
@0009Yes sir.@0003@0011
@000C...Still, Lord Arcard's story
is strange..@0003
The army from Lycia just got here.@0003
...Would they get tied in with
the bandits so quickly...?@0003
[0950]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0153
@0009@0017Are you ready?
We're going to move southward!@0003
@000CCaptain...
Are you sure we'll be all right?@0003
@0009Why?@0003
@000CPerhaps the Etrurian army means
to use us up front as disposables..@0003
@0009Who says that?@0003
@000COne of our group members heard rumors
like that in the Etrurian army.@0003
@0009If you take rumors seriously all the
time, you won't be able to do anything.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
@0009Besides, if that were true,
General Klein wouldn't approve of it.@0003
@000CDo you really think so?@0003
@0009General Klein's not like that.
I trust him.@0003
@000C...Alright.@0003
Then we'll trust him as well,
for we trust you, Captain.@0003
@0009Thanks.
Let's go!@0003
[0951]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@014D@0009@0017Lord Zinc, the reinforcements from
Djuto should be arriving shortly.@0003
@000CDamn!@0003
We're having enough trouble
as it is...@0003
I don't need any reinforcements
to take all the credit!@0003
[0952]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@014D@0009@0017Additional reinforcements
will be arriving shortly!@0003
@000CWell...
I hope this will be enough...@0003
[0953]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0122
@000C@0012@0017Excuse me!@0003
@0009@0013W-What are you!
I'm an enemy!@0003
@000C@0014I'm sorry...@0003
But you had such a sad look
in your eyes.@0003
@0009...There is village near
mountain.@0003
You know?@0003
@000C@0013Yes, I know.@0003
@0009Let the people escape.
I take order, I destroy village.@0003
So...@0003
@000C@0014What?
Don't!@0003
The people living in the
village are innocent...@0003
@0009@0013No.
I can't disobey order.@0003
@000C@0014Can't you leave the people
who give you orders like that?@0003
@0009Leave?@0003
@000C@0014@0017I know!
You should fight alongside us!@0003
We're protecting the villagers.@0003
@0009@0017...No...I'm a monster...
I can't be with other people...@0003
People throw stones...
They say 'go away' to me...@0003
I'm a monster...
Not human...@0003
@000CNo!@0003
Of course you're a human!
You're also a kind hearted human.@0003
I can tell.
Come with us.@0003
Don't be afraid.@0003
@0009@0013@0017Me afraid?@0003
I'm not afraid!
Everyone afraid of me.@0003
I'm not afraid!@0003
@000C@0014No.
You are afraid.@0003
You're scared that people will throw
stones at you, and they'll tell you@0003
to go away again.@0003@0016
@0009@0012@0016......@0003
@000C@0014It's okay.
The people in our army are nice people.@0003
@0017They won't be mean to you.
Come on...be brave.@0003
That out that first step to live
positively...@0003
[0954]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0129@0013@0017B-Big sister!@0003
@0009Thany...?@0003
@000C@0014What are you doing here?@0003
@0009...I have a contract with
General Klein of Etruria.@0003
Thany...
Are you with the Alliance Army?@0003
@000C@0012Yeah.@0003
@0009@0013I see...@0005
Then there is only one thing to do.@0003
Draw your spear!@0003
@000C@0080@000F@0014No...
I don't want to fight you!@0003
@0009...Thany, you know the code
of the Ilian mercenary knights.@0003
@000D...Never betray your employer...@0003
@0009Right.
And we must follow that code,@0003
even if it means fighting
against your own kin.@0003
@000D@0080@000EBut...
One of us might die!@0003
@0009@0080@000CI know that!@0003
But we have to fight!@0003
We can't let down other nations'
trust in Ilia's mercenaries.@0003
It's the only thing we have
to support ourselves!@0003
@000C@0013Tate...@0003
@000A@0014Now,
draw your spear, Thany!@0003@000C@0011@0002@0007
@000A...Why...@0003
Why did it have to be
like this...?@0003
[0955]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0129
@000C@0012Tate!@0003
@0009@0013@0017Thany...
Are you prepared to fight?@0003
@000C@0014@0017No!
We don't have to fight!@0003
@0009@0013@0017What are you saying?
I just told you...@0003
@000C@0014@0017General Klein said he
would join us!@0003
So we don't have to fight!@0003
@0009@0012@0017What?
Really...?@0003
We...
Really don't have to fight?@0003
@000C@0014@0017Yes!
We don't have to fight to@0003
follow the code!@0003
@0009@0016@0012......@0003
@000C@0016@0013@0017...Tate?@0003
@0009@0017...Good...@0003
@000C@0017Tate...@0003
@0009@0017Thank goodness...
Really...@0003
@000CDon't say we have
to fight...@0003
We'll always be together,
big sister...@0003
[0956]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0129@000C@0012@0017B-Big Sister!@0003
@0009@0013Thany...?@0003
@000CWhat are you doing here?@0003
@0009...I have a contract with
General Klein of Etruria.@0003
Thany...
Are you with the Alliance Army?@0003
@000C@0012Yeah.@0003
@0009@0013I see...@0005
Then there's only one thing to do.@0003
Draw your spear!@0003
@000C@0014No, General Klein said
@0017he would join us!@0003
@000C@0014We don't have to fight!@0003
@0009@0012@0017What? Really?@0003
@000C@0014@0017Yeah.@0003
@0009...All right.@0003
I'll join you as well.@0003
@000CThanks,
big sister!@0003
[0957]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@010D
@0009@0017Wait!
Aren't you an Etrurian general?@0003
Why are you attacking us!?@0003
@000CI have specific orders from
Lord Arcard to kill you.@0003@0009He ordered you?
Can't you see what's happening here?@0003
The people here are suffering from
their landlord's abusive treatment!@0003
And you're helping him?
You should be ashamed!@0003
@000C...Wait.@0003
Did you say that you're
helping the villagers?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
The marquess here is ransacking
the villages, saying he's searching@0003
for rebels.@0003
We're fighting to stop him.@0003
But you seem to be siding
with him, so...@0003
@000CI have no such intention.@0003
I heard that you were the ones
working with the bandits to do evil.@0003
@0009What!?@0003
Why would we be working with
the bandits?@0003
We just want things cleaned up
here so we can get back to Lycia!@0003
@000C...Such mockery.@0003
@0009What!?@0003
@000CLord Arcard is underestimating me.@0003
I am not dull enough not to notice
who the real villans are.@0003
@0009@0017...Do you understand now?@0003
@000CI am Klein of the Reglay
family of Etruria.@0003
Forgive us for attacking you.@0003
@0009!
Yes!@0003
I am General Roy of the
Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@000CGeneral Roy, I would advise you
to be cautious.@0003
Since you have turned your back
on Lord Arcard, he would be sure@0003
to gather all of his henchmen
on these isles in every attempt@0003
to kill you.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
@000CIf you would allow it,
I would like to join you.@0003
@0009Really!?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
I wish to monitor your actions
as an Etrurian general.@0003
I should prove useful as
both a fighter and a diplomat.@0003
@0009Thank you.@0003
[0958]
@0009@0010@0103@000C@0010@010D
@0009Klein!@0003
@000CClarine?
You were safe?@0003
Thank goodness...@0003
@0009I'm sorry I left without
telling you.@0003
But I wanted to see you
so badly!@0003
@000C@0017The things you would do...@0003
Well, you're safe, and that's
what matters.@0003
@0017...And what brings you out here?@0003
Did you find someone trustworthy
to hire?@0003
@0009@0017No, I joined the Lycia Alliance
Army and am fighting alongside them.@0003
@000C@0017The Lycia Alliance Army?!@0003
@0009@0017Yes!@0003
My healing staves
have been very useful!@0003
@000C...I see.@0003
I thought your eyes looked...
sharper.@0003
@0009I'm now a lady, I am.@0003
@000C@0017...Let me ask you this.@0003
What kind of individual
is General Roy?@0003
@0009@0017Hmm...
He lacks a little finesse for a noble...@0003
I especially think he has to take
care of his hair a little more..@0003
@000C...Let me rephrase the question.@0003
@0017Is General Roy working with the
bandits and attacking the people here?@0003
@0009@0080@000BNo, of course not!
We are here to defeat the bandits!@0003
@000CI see...@0003
@0009The Etrurians here are evil
and malicious people...@0003
It is so embarassing.@0003
Klein...
Are you working for them?@0003
@000CNo.@0003
At least not now
after I heard your story.@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000CI was sent here to protect
the villagers.@0003
To fulfill my mission, I hereby join
join the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@0009@0017Klein!@0003
@000CThen let's go, shall we?
Will you introduce me to General Roy?@0003
@0009@0080@000COf course!
I love you, Klein.@0003
[0959]
@0009@0010@010D@000C@0010@0128
@0009Tate!@0003
@000C@0017General Klein!@0005
What is the matter?@0003
@0009I've made up my mind.@0003
We are going to fight alongside
General Roy in the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@000CUnderstood sir.
Then we will, as well.@0003
@0009Aren't you going to ask why?@0003
@000CWe are mercenaries.@0003
We follow our employer's every
order.@0003
Besides...@0005@0003
@0009Besides?@0003
@000C@0017I trust that you would@0005
not make the wrong judgements.@0003
@0009Thank you, Tate.@0003
[095A]
@0009@0010@0103@000C@0010@010D
@0009Klein!@0003
@000CClarine!@0003
I'm glad you're all right.@0003
I was worried when I heard
@0017that you disappeared.@0003
@0009I'm sorry.
I just couldn't wait to see you.@0003
@000C@0017The things you would do...@0003
Well, you're safe and that's
what matters.@0003
@0017And what brings you out here?@0003
Did you find someone trustworthy
to hire?@0003
@0009@0017I've been fighting alongside
the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@000C@0017The Alliance Army!?@0003
@0009@0017Yes.@0003
@000C@0017Well...
You've been through a lot.@0003
@0009@0017I'm a lady now,
I am.@0003
[095B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018A
@0017...We rebels suffered a
humiliating defeat here.@0003
Here, take this.
I'm going to look for other survivors.@0003
As long as we can find our leader,
we still have hope.@0003
[095C]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0189
@0017Dammit!
Just because those rebel idiots@0003
are raising hell, we ordinary
people have to deal with the@0003@0002
consequences. What...
You know what happens if we@0003
go against our landlord.
We just want to lead a normal life.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Hey...
W-Wait.@0003
I can't do anything...
but take this...@0003
[095D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0184
@0017I wonder how Mary's doing...
Her brother and his friends are@0003
all out there trying to make money.
It's too dangerous to go outside@0003
now... Can you go check on her?
Here, I'll give you this, so...@0003
[095E]
@0009@0010@011E@000C@0010@015A
@000C@0012Ward!@0003
@0009@0013Sis!
It's good to see you.@0003
@000CYou've returned?@0003
@0009@0017Well not really...
We just came here on a mission...@0003
@000C...You're not going
to come back anymore?@0003
@0009@0014No! That's not the case!@0003
...But I'm not ready to return yet.
Just wait,@0003
I'll come back with lots of
money so we can live an easier life.@0003
@000C@0017I don't care about that...
I just want you to be safe.@0003
@0009@0013@0017Sis...@0003
@000C@0014@0017I know it's pointless to tell
you to be careful with that personality@0003
of yours... but just remember that there
are people worried for you. Okay?@0003
@0009@0016@0012......@0003
@000C@0016@0013Here, take this.@0003
@0009@0012@0017What's this?@0003
@000C@0014@0017It's a special weapon.@0003
I treated the wounds of a traveler
a while back, and he left it@0003
in return. You can use it, can't you?@0003
@0009Thanks, sis!
I'll be going.@0003
@000C@0013Be careful...@0003
[095F]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@015A
@0009@0012@0017Mary...@0003
@000C@0013@0017Lot!
You've returned?@0003
@0009@0014@0017No...
We just stopped by on a mission.@0003
@000C@0013Oh...
Myu. will be sad.@0003
@0009@0014Ever since mother died,
I've been making you take care of Myu.@0003
I'm sorry.@0003
@000C@0013No...don't be...@0003
@0009@0012Someday...@0003
@000C!@0003
@0009@0013Someday I'll return.
...Can I leave Myu to you until then?@0003
@000C...Can you promise?@0003
@0009...Yes.@0003
@000C@0014Don't lie... You're going to war.
There's no saying you'll return.@0003
@0009@0016@0012......@0003
@000C@0016@0013@0017But I'll be waiting.
Without false hope...@0003
@0009@0012@0017I'm sorry.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Oh, take this.@0003
@0009@0012@0017What?@0003
@000C@0014@0017It's a magic weapon that
will help you keep your promise.@0003
@0009@0013Thank you, I appreciate it.
Well then... I must be off.@0003
@000C@0017Be careful...@0003
[0960]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015A@0017Have you seen my brother?@0003
His name is Ward,
and he's a mercenary...@0003
Have you at least
heard of him?@0003 
[0961]
@0009@0010@011E@000C@0010@015B
@000C@0013It's Ward!@0003
@0009@0014@0017Hey, how have you been doing?
...Come on,@0003
can't you at least say 'big
brother Ward' instead of just Ward?@0003
@000C@0017But... Ward is Ward.@0003
@0009@0013Ah, never mind.
You look like you've been okay.@0003
@000CYes!@0003
@0009@0017...Anyway, it's dangerous here.
Go hide in the hills or something.@0003@000C...Alone?@0003
@0009Sis is still here, right?
She'll take you.@0003
@000C@0014@0017Yeah, big sister Mary's here too.@0003
@0009@0017You call sis 'big sister'
and me just 'Ward', huh?@0003
@000C@0012@0017Oh.
Here.@0003
@0009@0013@0017What's this?
A feather?@0003
@000C@0014@0017It makes you like a bird!@0003
@0009@0013@0017Like a bird?
What's that supposed to mean?@0003
@000C@0017Like a bird is like a bird.@0003
@0009@0014@0016???@0016@0017
Uh, anyway,@0003
you're giving this to me?@0003
@000C@0017No.
It's for my big brother Lott.@0003
@0009@0013@0017Even he's not just 'Lott'...@0003
@000C@0014@0017Hahaha... I'll go see Mary.
Here's the feather.@0003
Give it to Lott, okay,
big brother Ward?@0003@0011
@0009She sure can change her tune quickly...
@0017Woah be careful! Don't trip...@0003
[0962]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@015B
@000CBig brother! You're home!@0003
@0009@0013Myu!
Have you been good?@0003
@000CYes!@0003
I was good!
I didn't even wet my bed!@0003
@0009Good girl.@0003
@000C@0014@0017Lott...
While you were away, Mom...@0003
@0009Yeah, I know...
She went to a faraway place...@0003
@000CHere...
Mom left it for you.@0003
She said you'll find a use for it.@0003
@0009@0012......@0003
@000C@0014Big brother...
You won't leave me, right?@0003
You won't go to a faraway place@0003
without me like Mom...@0003
@0009@0017Of course not!@0003
I'll come back here with lots
of presents for you.@0003
So listen to what Mary says
and be a good girl, all right?@0003
@000C@0012Okay!@0003
@0009@0014@0017Anyway, hide in the hills with Mary.
It's dangerous here.@0003
@000C@0013Yes sir...
@0017Lott?@0003
@0009@0012?@0003
@000C@0013You promised!
You won't go to a faraway place, right?@0003
@0009Yeah...@0003@000C@0011
@0009I hope I can keep that promise...@0003
[0963]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015BBig brother?@0003
@0017...Oh.
I'm sorry...@0003
[0964]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0182
Ah, our heroes!
I wish you thanks on@0003
the villages behalf.
is a scale from a real Dragon.@0003
They say it protects you with
a magical barries when you@0003
use it. Please take it.@0003
[0965]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0186
A few months ago, my granddaughter
went missing. The villagers searched@0003
the mountains for her,@0003
and when they found her,
she was with a huge monster of a man.@0003
We threw stones at him and drove him off...
But my granddaughter told me that@0003
he found her crying and led her to
the village. ..If you see that man,@0003
would you give him this?@0003
It's a special axe that's effective
against swords.@0003
And...
@0006@0002tell him I'm sorry.@0003
[0966]
@0010@014DThe people are suffering...?@0005
Fools.@0003@0002
What is it to me?
Their purpose is to@0003
die in my service.@0003
I couldn't care less
about the wails of those@0003
worthless animals.@0003

[0967]
@0010@014D
@0017This is my land..
Mine only...@0003@0002
No one...
shall...@0003
[0968]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Master Roy, there is a
young man here@0003
to see you.@0003
He says he is@0003
a member of the@0003
of the resistance force.@0003
@000C@0017Let him pass.@0003@0009@0011
@0008@0010@012BAh, so you are Roy?@0003
Pleased to meet you,
my name is Elphin.@0003
I am a member of the@0003
resistance forces here.@0003
@000CI am Roy of the
Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
@0008My thanks for saving our
village here.@0003
@000CNo, we simply did
what we thought was right.@0003
@0008@0017But now you have rebelled
against Etruria.@0003
Certainly you had thought of that
before you took action?@0003
@000CEven so,
we did what we felt was right.@0003
Although this is a sign of rebellion@0003
against Etruria, if the truth about
these islands is made public, they@0003
will understand.
I have sent a letter to a@0003
trustworthy member of the Etrurian
Nobility.@0003
If she takes the appropriate@0003
measures, I think we can tip the
tables in our favor.@0003
@0008I would not be so sure of that...@0003
@000CWhat do you mean?@0003
@0008Did you ever think it strange
that Etruria sent you in to@0003
rid of the bandits?@0003
@000CActually yes... of course.@0003
@0008This is merely my theory...@0003
But I believe that the ones who
requested your help are@0003
Advisor Roartz and Lord Arcard.@0003
@000C...How do you know that?@0003
@0008Why did those two have to
get your army off the mainland?@0003
Could there be some kind of problem
if you had stayed in Lycia?@0003
@000COh...@0003
I never thought of it
from that perspective...@0003
@0008There are rumors...@0003
That Roartz and Arcard are
actually tied in with Bern.@0003
[0969]
@0009@0010@015A@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0014Are you this this
army's leader?@0003
@000C@0013@0017Yes.@0003
@0009@0014@0017I wanted to thank you@0003
for protecting our village.@0003
@000CNo...
I just did what I thought was right.@0003
@0009Please take this as
a token of our gratitude.@0003
[096A]
@0009@0010@01DC@000C@0010@010D
@0009General Klein,@0003
we will stay here and reconstruct
the area, as you directed us.@0003
@000CGood.@0003
@0009We wish we could fight
alongside you.@0003
Oh, and here is the arrow you
had us keep.@0003
I will give it back to you.@0003
Farewell and good luck, General Klein.@0003
@000CThank you.@0003
[096B]
@000C@0010@0128@0009@0010@0153
Captain!@0003
We will return to Ilia
to make our report.@0003
@000CThanks.@0003
@0009Oh, and this...@0003
Your sister gave it to me
before we left.@0003
Please be careful...@0003
@000CThank you.
You be careful too.@0003
[096C]
@000C@0010@0187@0017Hurry!
Over here!@0003
@0009@0010@0189A-Are you sure?
If we get caught...@0003
@000CYou idiot!@0003
If we stay there, we have no
choice but to work and work@0003
until we die!@0003
You're going to put up with
that?@0003
Don't you have family or
something back home?@0003
@0009Yeah...@0003
@000CIf we escape toward the northeast,
there are some people who can help us.@0003
We've got to get there!@0003
[096D]
@000C@0010@0146@0017What!
Some more people escaped!?@0003
@0080@000EWhat were the guards doing!@0003
@0008@0010@014FSomebody put sleeping
drugs in their food...@0003
@000C...That means there is someone
among our ranks who is taking@0003
contact with the enemy.@0003@0008@0011
@000CMorgan!@000A@0010@01DD@0003
@000CI want you to pursue and
capture those who have escaped.@0003
@000AYes, my lord.@0003@001C
@000CI will return to the capital at Djuto.
Don't let them escape.@0003
Also keep sending workhands to the mines.
I can't afford to lose that mine now!@0003
[096E]

[096F]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Elphin,
that castle to the southwest...@0003
@0009Yes,
that is Castle Idina.@0003
The people captured on this island@0003
are first sent there before they
are ported to Mt. Ebrakhm.@0003
Today just happens to be the day
that the captives are sent to the@0003
mines on a weekly basis.@0003
Rescuing them will be difficult if
we have to go all to the mines.@0003
@000CThen we must rescue
them now!@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
I have already sent some spies
to sneak into the castle to help@0003
the people escape.@0003
@000CHow will they release
the captives?@0003
@0009I have told them to send the
captives to the northeast.@0003
In other words, here.@0003
@000CThen we must first rescue those
people before attacking the castle.@0003
[0970]
@0009@0010@0189@000C@0010@0120
@000C@0017So the people living on this
island are captured in that castle?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
@000CWell then, let's go rescue
them, shall we?@0003
@0009...I'm sorry.@0003
I know you were looking for your
daughter, and we made you help@0003
us out like this...@0003
@000C@0017Well, you guys helped me,
so I should help you, too.@0003
Besides, a real man wouldn't look at
people suffering due to their marquess'@0003
greed and simply ignore them.@0003
[0971]
@0009@0010@01DD@000C@0010@01D7
@000CLord Morgan,
the reinforcements are ready!@0003
@0009Good.
Send them out immediately.@0003
Send them from the back so that they
can defend the castle even if we@0003
should be surrounded.@0003
[0972]

[0973]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@0113
@000C@0013@0017Father?
What are you doing here?@0003
@0009@0017Ah, Fir!
I was looking for you.@0003
@000C@0014@0017Father,
I have made up my mind.@0003
I want to become a great
swordfighter like Mother...@0003
@0009@0017I understand.
I don't mean to drag you home.@0003
In fact, I want to assist you
in your journey.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Assist me?@0003
@0009@0014Well, I know that there are a lot of
hardships during a journey of training.@0003
So I can help you out
in tough situations...@0003
@000CBut Father, if you kept helping me,
there would be no point to my training.@0003
@0009@0012Nonsense.@0003
@0014Would you not be able to train your
sword skills with your father around?@0003
Or do you not understand your Father's
love for worrying about you like this?@0003
@000C@0013No!
That's not it...@0003
@0009@0017Well then,
we understand each other.@0003
But first we must capture that castle.@0003
@0011@000C@0012@0017Sigh....@0003
@0014I have to tell Roy that we're
getting another member...@0003
[0974]

[0975]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018B
Are you the guys
helping us out?@0003
Then please take this.
I grabbed it when I was@0003
escaping from the castle.
I hope everyone else made@0003
it out okay...

[0976]
@0010@01DD
@0017What are you doing!@0003
Hurry off and kill@0002
the ones who escaped!@0003
...?
Wh-Who are you people!?@0003
[0977]
@0010@01DD
@0017The resistance forces in this
area have been eliminated...@0003@0002
Who...are you people...?@0003
[0978]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Elphin!
Are you all right?@0003
@0009@0017I should still...
...!@0003
@000C@0017You should stay off the battlefield.
Leave the fighting to us.@0003
@0009Yes...
Forgive my being a hindrance...@0003
[0979]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Even though we've captured Castle Idina
and released the people here, it doesn't@0003
mean we've rescued all the people
living on these isles.@0003
@0009Right.@0003
To fully liberate the Western Isles,
we must get rid of the Etrurian@0003
capital.@0003
@000CSo we must head for Djuto.@0003
...Elphin,
may I ask you something?@0003
@0009What is it, Master Roy?@0003
@000CCorrect me if I'm wrong.@0003
But are you not someone of
high Etrurian nobility?@0003
@0009!!@0003@0002
...What makes you think that?@0003
@000CWell...
I can't really explain it, but...@0003
For example, the way you talk
sounds very educated.@0003
In Ostia, I learned how to 'study'
people and to make estimates about@0003
them.@0003
Anyway, am I right?@0003
@0009What would you do if I
were what you think I am?@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
No, I wouldn't do anything
in particular.@0003
@0009?@0003
@000CYou must have some reason
to hide your identity.@0003
You can tell me when you
feel comfortable about it.@0003
Okay?@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CThen let's go to Djuto!@0003
To save these isles and
defeat our true enemy!@0003
[097A]

[097B]
@0008@0010@0189@000A@0010@0187@000C@0010@0154
@000AHey, you with the mustache!@0003
@000CWhat!
Who are you?@0003
@000AHere,
give this to General Roy.@0003
Thanks to him, we can see
our families again.@0003
@0008We people of the Western Isles
never forget when people help us!@0003@001C
@000AMake sure you say thanks
for us.@0003@001C
@0008And that we all express our gratitude
from the bottom of our hearts!@0003
[097C]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0148
@000C@0017...
So Narshen fell at Aquleia.@0003
@0009Yes.
It has been confirmed.@0003
@000CI see...@0003@0009@0011
@0008@0010@0146@000A@0010@013DL-Lady Brenya...
What will become of us?@0003
@000CPlease do not worry,
Lord Roartz.@0003
We will not neglect you,
who have assisted us.@0003
I shall assure that.@0003
@001C@0008@0017Thank you...@0003@001C
@000C@0017Then, Lord Arcard, you will be
assigned the defense of this land,@0003
Talas.@0003
Lord Roartz, your post will be the@0003
city of Bulgar.@0003
@0008Talas!?
W-Wait!@0003
This is too close to Aquleia.
The enemy is already too close!@0003
@000C@0017Then what you must do is
defeat them.@0003
This is a good place to set up
defenses because the enemy will@0003
most surely attack here because
it is so close to the capital.@0003
We can be most prepared here.@0003
@0008@0017Well,
that's true...@0003
@000ABulgar...@0003
That is in the foreign land
of Sacae.@0003
I hear that there is much@0003
rebellion among the nomads...@0003
@000C@0017Then force them into submission.
Is that not your speciality?@0003
@000A@0017Well...@0003
@000C@0017Rumours say that the enemy commander,
Roy, is still a boy.@0003
But he has gone through many scandals
and conspiracies and rebuilt the Lycia@0003
Alliance Army and has strengthened
it further than ever.@0003
Compared to his hardships, your's are
close to nothing.@0003
Am I wrong?@0003@001C@0008@0017......@0003@001C
@000CThen I must be off.@0003
I will be praying for
your success.@0003@0011
@0009@0016......@0003
[097D]
@0008@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0148
@0008@0017...Are you sure?@0003
@000CThey are disgraceful cowards who cast
away their homeland and fled to safety.@0003
We must not assist them anymore than
necessary.@0003
They should be thankful that they are
getting the land troops that they are.@0003
@0008@0016......@0003
[097E]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0013We are soon approaching
the Etrurian border.@0003
@000C@0014Bishop Yodel, I must thank you
for everything.@0003
Thanks to the Church, we were@0003
able to proceed thus far with
ease.@0003
@0009Please.@0003
If you had not captured Aquleia,
we would be suffering from@0003
prosecution under Bern.@0003
This is nothing in comparison
to what you did for us.@0003
@000C@0013@0017I am glad that I can could
be of use to you.@0003
@0009@0014Now...@0003
May I ask you a very
important favor?@0003
@000CYes, anything that I
am capable of.@0003
@0009If you find out anything else
about the Dragons...@0003
@000CI understand.@0003
If I discover anything new, I
will report to you immediately.@0003
@0009@0017Thank you!@0003
@0017...@0003
Oh yes,
I must tell you something else.@0003
The lands around here...@0003
They are surrounded by high
mountains and valleys.@0003@0002
@0009And it is night now...@0003
@000CThe perfect place for ambushing...@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
Castle Talas up ahead
is under Bern's control.@0003
@000CAll right.
I will be careful.@0003
@0009@0014@0017Yes, please.@0003
Then, may Saint Elimine
bless the Etrurian Army!@0003
[097F]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0168
Are you fighting Bern?
Then please take this staff.@0003
I heard a noble princess
once used it...@0003
[0980]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017A
We don't get many visitors
up here...@0003
What?@0003
The enemy was going to
attack our village?@0003
I see...
I must thank you for@0003
informing us.
Please take this.@0003
[0981]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017D
I hear there's a village
far to the northeast.@0003
It's too far from here,
so nobody's ever seen it,@0003
but I wonder if anyone's
living there?@0003
[0982]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0177
I saw a strange person
in Bern's ranks.@0003
Probably a thief.@0003
I think you should tell the
villagers before they get robbed.@0003
[0983]
@0010@0146@0017W-Why!@0003
Why is this happening
to me?!@0003
[0984]
@0010@0146@0017I...am an...
Etrurian... noble...!@0003@0002
I must not die...
here... Guh!@0003
[0985]
@000D@0010@0154@000B@0010@0102
@000D@001C@0017Lord Arcard...@0003
What a pathetic ending for one
who became so powerful.@0003
@000B@001CWell, last year I didn't think
we would be doing this either.@0003
Maybe fate can turn out in the
most unlikely way...@0003
And that might be true for Bern
also...@0003
@000D@0011@0009@0010@0154...?@0003
Master Roy, what is that
you are holding in your hand?@0003
@000BOh, this?
This is the Fire Emblem.@0003
@0009Oh...
So this tiny gem...@0003
@000BPrincess Guinevere wanted me
to keep it.@0003
It seemed...@0003
difficult for her to give it
to me...@0003
She must have been hoping to
end the war peacefully until@0003
there was no hope left...@0003
@0009Hmmm...
Trust between siblings?@0003
It didn't seem likely on
the outside.@0003
@000B@0012Why not?@0003
@0009@0014The enemy is Zephiel,
king of Bern!@0003
It is said that he murdered his own
he father, so I didn't think that@0003
would be moved by family trust...@0003
@000B@0080@000EWhat?!
He killed his own father?@0003
@0009@0014Didn't you know,
Master Roy?@0003
Zephiel took the throne because the
former king had died.@0003
But because the former king's death
had been so sudden, there are@0003
many rumors going around.@0003
@000CAnd one of them is...@0003
@0009@0014...That Zephiel assassinated him.@0003
@000C...Does Princess Guinevere know
about this?@0003
@0009She must know something about
it, if not at all.@0003
@000C@0012@0016......@0003
[0986]
@000C@0010@01CD@0009@0010@01D7@0017The Etrurian army has appeared
from the west.@0003
@000CGood.@0003
Draw them into our territory as
planned.@0003
We shall show them our strength.
Have the other clans been notified?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
Although there are many clans who
are expressing their discontent@0003
toward our alliance with Bern, further
invasion by Etrurian forces seem@0003
to require more attention.@0003
@000CI see.@0003
...The Etrurian army should be
easier to deal with than that@0003
"Silver Wolf" since the Etrurian
army is an invasion force.@0003
@0009The clans will unite to fight
against invaders...@0003
@000CYes.
That is the law of Sacae.@0003
When we were up against the Silver Wolf,
no one aided us because they saw it@0003
as a conflict between clans.@0003
@0009But now we have Bern behind
us, so we need not any help.@0003
@000CExactly.@0003
Then of course, there are many
who don't like the idea that@0003
it is Bern who has actual
control of Sacae's politics.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
I hear there are many clans
who agree with the Silver Wolf's@0003
guerilla tactics and joined
forces with him.@0003
@000CHe is stubborn.@0003
His clan was defeated, so he
should join us.@0003
It is not as if he doesn't know
what happens to those who try and@0003
fight a head-on battle with Bern.@0003
@0009Even large cities like Bulgar have
been attacked and taken over by Bern@0003
since they resisted.@0003
@000CFrom now on, those who are strong
enough to manipulate the situation@0003
around them will survive, like us.
And right now, we must use the law@0003
of Sacae to do so.@0003

[0987]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Princess Guinevere...
We are getting close to Bern's army.@0003
@0009...Yes.@0003
@000CSince we are getting closer, we
are clashing with soldiers from Bern@0003
more and more often.@0003
It will not be long until we engage
in full combat with Bern.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CI wish to ask you something
before we do.@0003
@0009What is that?@0003
@000CI have been hearing rumors...
that King Zephiel rose to the throne@0003
because he killed his father, the
former king.@0003
@0009@0080@000A!!@0003
@000CI could not believe it.@0003
You tried to stop him even by casting
away your nationality.@0003
If King Zephiel is such a mad individual
as the rumors say, then you would not of@0003
thought of doing what you did.@0003
@0008@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Princess Guinevere,@0003
I accepted the Fire Emblem not
to use it in battle, but to@0003
try and find a use for it
to end this war peacefully.@0003
@0008Roy...@0003
@000CTherefore, please tell me
the truth about the rumors...@0003
@0008I...I'm sorry.
Please...give me some time.@0003@0011

[0989]

[098A]

[098B]

[098C]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017A
All of the clans shall
unite to defeat invaders...@0003
That is the law of Sacae.@0003
[098D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017A
Pray daily to the sky and
and earth...@0003
That is the law of Sacae.@0003
[098E]
@0009@0010@FFFF @000C@0010@017C
The clans shall go into
a defensive arc to fend@0003
off invaders.
That is the law of Sacae.@0003
[098F]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017C
Enemies shall face the wrath
of our fellow clansmen...@0003
That is the law of Sacae.@0003
[0990]
@0010@01CDYes...
That's right!@0003
Closer...closer...@0003@0002
Right into our trap!@0003
[0991]
@0010@01CDArgh...!
How could you defeat us...@0003@0002
My calculations...were...
flawless...@0003
[0992]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017That was no easy feat.@0003
@000CBut now we have hit our strongest
enemy in Sacae hard.@0003
Although I'm sure that there are
remaining forces somewhere.@0003
@0009They must be meeting
to plan a retaliation.@0003
@000CCan we find out where
they are meeting?@0003
@0009Well, I sent a spy out earlier,
so he should be returning soon.@0003
I will go check.@0003@0011@0007@0080@0004
@0008@0010@0157......@0003
@000CIs something wrong,
Princess Guinevere?@0003
@0008@0080@000B...I have come to speak
about my brother.@0003
@000C!!
...Is it all right?@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
I want you to know before we
enter Bern...about the tragedies@0003
that have occurred.@0003
You asked earlier if my brother
murdered the former king.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009In short...@0005
it is true.@0003
@000C!@0003
Then King Zephiel indeed killed his
own father to seize the throne...@0003
@0009@0080@000CNo!@0003
@000CNo?@0003
He didn't kill his father
to get the throne?@0003
@000ANo...@0003
Our father was the first
one who tried to kill Zephiel.@0003
@000CWhat!?
Then King Zephiel...@0003
@000AHe...couldn't bear the abuse he
was taking from our father.@0003
And so he...@0003
@000CWhat...
Why did....@0003@0080@0004
@0008@0010@0154...Master Roy!@0003
We have found where the
enemy is meeting!@0003
...?
What is the matter?@0003@001C
@000ANo...it is nothing.
Perhaps later...@0003@0011@001C
@0008...Did I appear at a bad time?@0003
@000CNo, it's okay.
Where is the meeting place?@0003
@0008@0080@000BIt is in a city called Bulgar.@0003
@000CBulgar...
I've heard of it.@0003
@0009It is the largest city in Sacae.@0003
Although, now it has been taken
down by Bern.@0003
@000COh...@0003
All right, we'll be
heading there soon.@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0002...Why did the former king
try to murder his own son?@0003
[0993]
@0009@0010@013D@0080@000B@0017They're here...!
And so quickly...@0003
Could they not have given me
the time to set up defenses!@0003
@000C@0010@014EWe will try and stop the enemy
from progressing any further.@0003
You can retreat to the palace
and fortify your defenses there.@0003
@0009...Can you hold them back?@0003
@000CWe must at least try.@0003
@0009@0080@000BIf you do not know whether
you can win or not...@0003
@000CThen what would you do?
Flee?@0003
Tell me, just where do
think you can hide?@0003
@0009......@0003
@000CGeneral Brenya has given me
orders to protect you.@0003
And I will do so with all my
strength!@0003
But you must not be afraid to
fight either!@0003
@0009...A-All right...@0003
Then I shall fortify the inside
and leave the outside to you.@0003@0011@0006
@0009@0010@01D7...That is the highest advisor
of the Etrurian council?@0003
Why should we fight for him at
all?@0003
@000CDon't say that.@0003@0002
General Brenya didn't willingly tell
us to protect him.@0003
She had no choice because Etruria
joined forces with Bern.@0003
Therefore, we must fulfill our
our duties as warriors.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I have also gotten hold of
information that allies of the Silver@0003
Wolf are lurking around here.@0003
Keep on guard at all times.@0003
@0009Yes sir.@0003
[0994]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102@0017Princess Guinevere.@0003
@0009...We fight again today.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
I am sorry that I cannot find
the time to talk with you at@0003
leisure.@0003
@0009No, it is all right.@0003
...My brother started this in the
first place.@0003
@000CPrincess...@0003
@0009...Yes?@0003
@000CMay I ask the reason why
Bern's former king tried@0003
to murder King Zephiel?@0003
@0009...Zephiel and I have different mothers.
So I am in actuality his half sister.@0003
@000CI heard that Zephiel's mother
was the Etrurian princess.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
It was an arranged marrige to strengthen
the tie between Bern and Etruria.@0003
However, our father already had a woman
he loved at that time.@0003
She was my mother.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016The marriage between our father
and Zephiel's mother was forced.@0003
Therefore, our father didn't love
Zephiel's mother and always@0003
thought badly of Zephiel.@0003
@000CThen is that why the former king
and King Zephiel had a bad relationship?@0003
@0009No...@0003
Even then, Zephiel was always trying
his best to gain our father's affection.@0003
He excelled in his studies and military
training and was always trying hard.@0003
He grew to become a proud heir to
Bern's throne.@0003
@000C@0080@000DThen why did the king try to...@0003
@000DMaster Roy!
We are ready for the attack!@0003
@000BAll right,
I'll be there in a minute!@0003@0002
Princess Guinevere,
I am sorry, but...@0003
@0009No, it is all right.
Please be careful.@0003
[0995]
@000B@0010@0124@0017Well well...
So it has started.@0003
@000D@0010@0107So it seems.@0003
@0009@0010@017BJust when we thought Bern had
finished invading, now we@0003
have to deal with Etruria.
Sigh.@0003
@000D@0016......@0016@0003
@000BSmall wonder.
This is a large trading city.@0003
Any army would want control of it.@0005
Well then...@0003
@0009H-Hey wait,
where are you going?@0003
@000BI'm going to watch the fight.
Let us see how good that Roy is.@0003
@0009What, now?
But...@0003
@000BDon't you worry about me.
Everything will be fine.@0003@0011
@000D@0011@0009What? Hey wait!
You're leaving too?@0003
[0996]
@0009@0010@014EThe reinforcements should be
arriving soon...@0003
I want you to@000C@0010@01D7@0009open the front gate to
let the reinforcements in when@0003
they arrive.@0003
@000CYes sir.@0003
[0997]
@0009@0010@014E@000C@0010@01D7
@0009Tell the troops to start attacking the
guerilla forces hiding in the houses.@0003
@000CYes sir.@0003
[0998]
@0009@0010@01D7All right, they should be here soon...
Open the gate!@0003
[0999]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017B
I was selling weapons to Bern
before the war...@0003
But now that they've taken
over the city,@0003
They won't pay me anything!
Here, I'll give you this@0003@0002
Dragon-killing sword,
so can you do something?@0003
I've been hiding it from them...
You know why...don't you?@0003
[099A]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0179
Would you like a magic
ring from Etruria?@0003
People used to buy them before,
but I had to close my shop@0003
because of the war.
Here, take one...@0003
They won't sell anyway.@0003
[099B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017D
This goddess statue@0003
brings good luck.
Well, I used to say that@0003
to trick people,
but I can't do business@0003
with the war going on.
Here, take one.@0003
It won't bring you any luck, though.@0003
[099C]
@000C@0010@017F
Phew...@0005
I found this,@0003
so I'm not stealing it!
I'm sure I can sell it...@0003
@0009@0010@FFFF
@000CWhoa!
A-Are you from Bern?@0003
No, I wasn't stealing
this sword!@0003
See ya!@0003
[099D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017E
This is a Longbow,
a favorite of Sacae clans.@0003
Here, take one.
Use it to drive Bern's@0003
soldiers out of here!@0003
[099E]
@0010@014EI am Gel.@0003@0002
Behold my blade...@0003
As I swing it for
for the last time.@0003
[099F]
@0010@014EAs a swordsman...
This...is inevitable.@0003
[09A0]
@000A@0010@0124@000C@0010@0102
@000AHm.@0003
You're not too bad,
are you?@0003
@000C@0017W-Who are you!?@0003@001C
@0008@0010@0152What!?
Hey!@0003
I said you couldn't come in.
Master Roy is very busy.@0003
@000CWhat's the matter?@0003
@0008She kept pestering me that
she wanted to see you.@0003
But you were busy so I
was trying to drive her away.@0003@001C
@000A@0017Listen to me first.@0003
Then you can decided whether to want
to get rid of me or not.@0003
I think I have some information that
you might be interested in.@0003
@000C@0017...What is that?@0003
@000A@0017It is about the beasts
who change form into humans.@0003
@000C@0006@0017...I want to speak
with her in private.@0003
Can you leave the room?@0003
@001C@0008Yes sir.@0003@0011
@000A@0080@000BWell well, that got you
interested, didn't it?@0003
@000CThose beasts you speak of...@0003
@0009Right. Dragons.@0003
@000CThe Dragons you speak of...@0003
They are not the Wyverns that Bern's
Dragon Knights use, but the strange@0003
troops that are mixed in with
Bern's soldiers...@0003
@0009Exactly.@0003
Those are the Dragons that
were supposedly defeated@0003
in the Dragon Human wars.@0003
@000C...Who are you?@0003
@0009I am Niime.@0003
I study ancient Dark Magic in the mountains,
so some call me the Hermit on the Mountain.@0003
This war...at first I thought it was just
another battle so I didn't pay heed to it.@0003
But now I can feel the evil among Bern's
troops, so I investigated.@0003
@000CAnd did you find
out anything?@0003
@0009The Dragons are indeed shrouded
in mystery.@0003
I looked through many ancient books
and scrolls, but I could only decipher@0003
so many of them.@0003
But...@0003
@000C...But?@0003
@0009I have come to believe that Bern
has resurrected the Dark Dragon.@0003
@000CDark Dragon...@0003
That is the leader of the
Dragons that Hartmut defeated.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
@0009Dragons are simply a much more advanced
species than humans.@0003
They have much greater vitality and
intellect than us.@0003
However, there was one thing that the
Dragons lagged far behind the humans in.@0003
The Dragons' reproductive system was
much less efficient than that of the@0003
humans.@0003
But even then, the Dark Dragon...
It had the power to create more Dragons.@0003
That is what I learned from my research.@0003
[09A1]
@000C@0010@013D@0017They allowed them to get in to
the palace!?@0003
@0080@000EBlast!@0003
If I go to hell, then that Roy
shall be going down with me!@0003@0009@0010@01D7Lord Roartz!@0003
The remainders of the Djute Clan are
saying that they'll come to our aid@0003
once they have securely hidden
the Mirugre.@0003
@000CMirugre?@0005
Ah, one of the Divine Weapons.@0003
Good, we must hold our own until then!@0003
[09A2]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017This is Roartz's manor...@0003
@0009I understand that this palace holds
methods of attacking through little@0003
cracks in the framework.@0003
You must not think you are safe
just because your back is to the@0003
is to the wall.@0003
@000CDo you know much about this
place?@0003
@0009Well, I am at least slightly known
to know more things than most people.@0003
The rumor about the palace is
something I picked up back in the city.@0003
@000C...Do you know what the
Dark Dragon looks like?@0003
@0009Well, I can't say I'm absolutely sure@0003
about that.@0003
But I would love to see it with my
own eyes.@0003
@000CI was thinking...@0003
Maybe the Dark Dragon is in
human form as well.@0003
@0080@0004@0009Perhaps.@0003
Maybe all the Dragons are in
human form now.@0003
I've also heard stories of Dragons in
human form living with people.@0003
@000C@0013Nabata...@0003
@0009Hm?
Did you say something?@0003
@000CNo, nothing.@0003
@0009I don't know anything specific,
but I read in an ancient scroll@0003
that Dragons started taking human
form only after the Ending Winter.@0003
@000CThe Ending Winter...@0003
@0009You have heard about it,
have you not?@0003
@000CYes, only in legend.@0003@0002
'At the Winter of Ends, the
laws of nature were turned@0003
upside down.@0003
Day became night, and
summer became winter.'@0003
@0009That's it.@0003
These scrolls are so old and damaged
so I couldn't decipher all of them,@0003
but one thing is clear.@0003
The Ending Winter was a disaster
powerful enough to bend and twist@0003
the planet.@0003
@000CWhat caused it?@0003
@0009Who knows...@0003
Popular belief says that the
laws of nature were twisted when the@0003
Dragons unleashed vast amounts of
magical power, but I have no idea what@0003
really happened, either.@0003
But it does seem certain that Dragons
started taking human form after the@0003
Ending Winter.@0003
@000CYes, I agree.@0003
@0009Well either way,
the truth lies in Bern.@0003
[09A3]
@0009@0010@01CEThose pigs from Etruria...!@0003
I shall avenge the Djute Clan
right here, right now!@0003
[09A4]
@0009@0010@0107Good,
the palace is in chaos.@0003
I shall fight those Bern troops
@0017alone, to the death!@0003
[09A5]
@000C@0010@012C@0017So...@0003
This is Bulgar, the biggest city
in Sacae.@0003
I heard it was demolished by Bern,
but there are so many soldiers here...@0003
@0017There must be some treasure.@0003
[09A6]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Are you the Etrurian General
leading this group?@0003
@000CYes.
And you are?@0003
@0009I am Dayan.@0003
@000CDayan...?
I've heard it somewhere...@0003
@0009I must first thank you.@0003
My clan was always fighting against
Bern and the clans that followed Bern.@0003
We were forced to reside to guerrila
warfare instead of going up against@0003
them face to face.@0003
However, now that you have attacked
Bern, the tables are beginning to@0003
tip in our favor.@0003
@000CI see.
I am glad that I could help.@0003
@0009But I want to ask you one thing.@0003
Once this battle is over, do you
intend to withdraw your troops@0003
right away?@0003
@000CAfter this battle?@0003
@0009Yes.
Sacae belongs to us Sacaean people.@0003
If authoritarian rule by Bern is only
to be replaced by Etrurian rule, then@0003
we would have to fight you next.@0003
@000CRight after this battle...
That would not be possible.@0003
We must have Sacae as a base to
launch direct attacks on Bern.@0003
@0009What...
Directly into Bern's lands?@0003
@000CEven if we could drive off Bern now,
it would only be a matter of time@0003

his studies, he was skilled in war craft...@0003
He grew to be the perfect heir for the king.@0003
@0009That is correct.@0003
@000C@0014But still the former king
did not look kindly at him.@0003
@0009In fact...@0003
Our father began to hate Zephiel
because he grew to become such a@0003
brilliant and worthy youth.@0003
@000C@0012What...
is that supposed to mean...?@0003
@0009@0014Our father was a man of ordinary
skill and intellect.@0003
Therefore, Zephiel's outstanding skill
made our father cold towards him.@0003
@000C@0012@0016Jealousy...?@0003
@0009@0014@0016And then one day, our father
told Zephiel that 'the next heir to@0003
Bern would be Guinevere's husband.'@0003

forces throughout to populate the land.
And now, 1000 years later...
[0A72]
The Scouring...
The great war between Dragons and men...@0003
[0A73]
The Dragons were defeated
and disappeared from Elibe...@0003
[0A74]
Mankind celebrated victory and then
spread their forces throughout the continent...@0003
[0A75]
1000 years have passed...@0003
[0A76]
The people of the continent Elibe have
been spreading technology and civilization@0003
for some time now, after the Dragons had
been defeated in the Scouring.@0003
[0A77]
In the west resides the kingdom of
Etruria, which has the highest level of@0003
civilization in Elibe.@0003
[0A78]
The Kingdom of Bern, with a powerful
military and a practical and pragmatic@0003
attitude about life, is located in the east.@0003
[0A79]
These are the two strongest nations in Elibe,
and the lesser nations are located between@0003
them.@0003
[0A7A]
There is the Lycian Alliance, which is under
joint relationship of various marquesses.@0003
[0A7B]
The people of the Knights Union of Ilia
are hard at work cultivating the snowy@0003
wastelands in the north.@0003
[0A7C]
In Sacae live various clans which ride
through the plains on horseback.@0003
[0A7D]
Although there were occasional clashes
between nation-states, there was a general@0003
sense of balance of power and peace in
Elibe.@0003
However, that balance was suddenly
disrupted...@0003
[0A7E]
King Zephiel, ruler of the Kingdom of Bern,
has sent his forces out to conquer the rest@0003
of Elibe.@0003
[0A7F]
Bern's forces invaded Sacae and Ilia and
mercilessly massacred all those who stood@0003
against them.@0003
And now, Bern has shown signs of invading
the Lycia Alliance.@0003
[0A80]
A youth named Roy was in Lycia's largest
territory, Ostia.@0003
@0080@0004He was sent as a transfer student to train
to become the next Marquess of Pherae.@0003
However, @0080@0004Eliwood, who has fallen ill,
has sent for Roy to return home.@0003
[0A81]
@0080@0004Just around that time Lilina, the@0080@0004
daughter of Hector, had traveled to Lycia@0003
to pay her respects to Eliwood.@0003
[0A82]
After getting the message, Roy hurried
back home, taking with him his loyal@0003
knights and @0080@0004Bors, a knight from Ostia
responsible for Lilina's safety.@0003

[0A83]
The story begins when Roy had reached an
area on the outskirts of Pherae...@0003
[0A84]

[0A85]

[0A86]

[0A87]

[0A88]

[0A89]

[0A8A]
There is a small village on the border
of Pherae and Bern.@0003
Here was where Roy was to meet the
@0080@0004mercenary band that Eliwood had hired@0003
for him.@0003
[0A8B]
Just east of the village is a small castle
occupied by Bern's forces.@0003
When Roy had reached the village,
the castle was in a chaotic state.@0003
Roy had yet to learn that the confusion
going on in the castle was going to@0003
cause turbulence all over Elibe...@0003
[0A8C]

[0A8D]

[0A8E]

[0A8F]
Just to the north of Pherae territory
stands Castle Araphen.@0003
The Lycia Alliance had gathered here to
discuss the matters of going up against@0003
Bern.@0003
However, @0080@0004Roy@0080@0004 and @0080@0004Guinevere were only half
a day away from Castle Araphen, when a@0003
messenger brought them news that they
could not believe.@0003
The message was this:@0003
"Bern has a trio of elite generals
called the Three Dragon Lords."@0003
[0A90]
@0080@0004Two of these three, General Brenya and
@0080@0004General Narshen, have attacked Castle@0003
Araphen and nearly decimated the Lycia
Alliance Army.@0003

[0A91]
Although the morale of the Pherae Army went
down severely, @0080@0004Roy led his group towards@0003
Castle Araphen to find survivors and
check the damage.@0003
[0A92]

[0A93]

[0A94]

[0A95]

[0A96]

[0A97]

[0A98]
Respecting Hector's last wishes,
Roy made his way west toward Ostia.@0003
@0080@0004On the way there,
@0080@0004Roy passes through the Laus territory,@0003
goverened by @0080@0004Lord Eric.@0003
At a glance, Laus is a peaceful territory
with vast meadows and clear streams,@0003
but there was great skullduggery
going on behind the scenes...@0003
[0A99]
Lord Eric, Marquess of Laus, had been
working with Bern against his allies@0003
of Lycia.@0003
This gave @0080@0004Roy further shock.@0003
Lycia, where Roy had grown up in, was
no longer a safe place to be either.@0003
@0080@0004Heading for Ostia, Roy decided to move
@0080@0004through the mountains where people@0003
seldom want to avoid unncessary trouble.@0003
[0A9A]

[0A9B]

[0A9C]

[0A9D]

[0A9E]

[0A9F]
After taking @0080@0004Saul, a priest of the
Elimine Church, and @0080@0004Dorothy, his@0003
bodyguard into their ranks, @0080@0004Roy
and company crossed the mountains and@0003
entered the @0080@0004Thria lands, located to
the southeast of Ostia.@0003
Thria is governed by Lord Orun, a
half brother to Lord Hector.@0003
[0AA0]
Orun's home castle seemed to be a safe
place to stay for Roy.@0003

[0AA1]
However, Bern had its reach in the lands
of Thria as well...@0003
[0AA2]

[0AA3]

[0AA4]

[0AA5]
Hearing of the rebellion,
Roy hurried his pace towards Ostia.@0003
[0AA6]
According to the information that he had
gathered on the way, @0080@0004General Leygance,@0003
one of Lord Hector's advisors, had started
a rebellion with@0080@0004 Lieutenant Devias to sell@0003
Ostia to Bern.@0003
[0AA7]
Lilina had been captured and taken hostage
by Leygance. She was then imprisoned inside@0003
Castle Ostia, because Leygance thought
that he could use her for something@0003
later on.@0003
[0AA8]
Hearing that report, Roy and company
entered Ostia in an effort to@0003
rescue Lilina.@0003
[0AA9]
Ostia, the largest and most active city in
Lycia, was to become a battlefield,@0003
stained with blood...@0003
[0AAA]

[0AAB]

[0AAC]

[0AAD]

[0AAE]
Ostia's military primarily consists of
soldiers in heavy defense gear,@0003
such as Armor Knights and Generals.@0003
@0080@0004With them, Castle Ostia's defenses
have always been incredibly strong.@0003
For a long time now, the castle has been
rumored to be "unconquerable."@0003
However, that rumor was about to be
proven wrong.@0003
By @0080@0004Roy, who, ironically, wished
to protect the castle.@0003
[0AAF]

[0AB0]

[0AB1]

[0AB2]

[0AB3]

[0AB4]

[0AB5]

[0AB6]

[0AB7]
Roy vowed to protect Lilina forever.
However, with Bern coming full force at them,@0003
Roy's army wouldn't stand a chance.@0003
Therefore, they decided to try
and take the Divine Weapons before@0003
Bern got their hands on them.@0003
Lilina showed them to a cave

in the outskirts of Ostia,@0003
where the first Divine Weapon was hidden.@0003
The cave, located at the foot of a volcano,
was going to be a major ordeal for Roy.@0003
[0AB8]

[0AB9]

[0ABA]
After driving off General Narshen from
Ostia, @0080@0004Roy and company braced themselves@0003
for further attacks from @0080@0004Bern.@0003
However, Bern's belligerent movement
towards Lycia suddenly stopped altogether,@0003
as if to mock Roy and his caution.@0003
Bern was also maintaining a neutral
position regarding the truce offer@0003
from Etruria.@0003
Bern's sudden silence and lack of
activity could only be described as eerie.@0003
[0ABB]
With Hector gone, Eliwood was now the
only lasting power in Lycia.@0003
Eliwood summoned the various marquesses to
Pherae to discuss their future actions.@0003
@0080@0004It was decided that Eliwood was to
become the next leader of the Lycia Alliance@0003
and that a new Lycia Alliance Army would
be established.@0003
This new army's purpose was not to
take the offense against Bern, but@0003
rather take a defensive stance for Lycia.
For his victory against Bern in Ostia,@0003
@0080@0004Roy was chosen to be the leader of
the new Lycia Alliance army.@0003
[0ABC]
Slowly but surely, the people of Lycia
were starting to brighten up.@0003
Business was improving, and people's
attitudes started to get more optimistic.@0003
Around that time, Etruria called for Lycia's
assistance in ridding the @0080@0004Western Isles of
the outlaws and bandits making their base@0003
base there.@0003
[0ABD]
Lycia's citizens expressed their discontent
by saying that they saw no reason in sending@0003
troops all the way to the Western Isles, but
because Lycia needed Etruria's protection@0003
against Bern, they had no choice but to
oblige.@0003
@0080@0004Thus, Roy and the Lycia Alliance Army
passed through Etruria and made their way@0003
towards the Western Isles.@0003
[0ABE]
The Western Isles are the various
islands off the western coast of Elibe.@0003
Currently, they are colonies of Etruria.
The Western Isles are rich in minerals@0003
and natural resources, so mining@0003
is a major industry. However, these
minerals are worth a fortune,@0003
so various @0080@0004rogue groups have traveled
there hoping to loot the mines@0003
and sell the minerals for themselves.@0003
Thus, the people living on the Western Isles
spend their days in constant fear@0003
of bandit attacks.@0003
And Roy had been sent
to defeat these bandits.@0003

[0ABF]
Roy accompanied Cecilia to the
Etrurian capital of Aquleia.@0003
[0AC0]
After debating about Roy and Guinevere's
Position, the Etrurian Court decided@0003
[0AC1]
that they had no reason to attack Bern
when they hadn't suffered a direct@0003
offense.@0003
[0AC2]
Guinevere was to stay under Etrurian
Protection at Aquleia, and the Lycia@0003
Alliance Army was to be an independant
[0AC3]
squad under the Etrurian Military.
To test his worth, Etruria sent Roy@0003
[0AC4]
to the Western Isles, where his
mission was to rid the islands@0003
[0AC5]
of bandits there. The Western
Isles is an archipelago under@0003
[0AC6]
Etrurian protection lying to the west
Of the mainland. Many mining@0003
[0AC7]
corporations have sprouted up, trying
to monopolize the rich minerals that@0003
[0AC8]
lie in the islands' soils. However,
the riches attracted many bandits,@0003
[0AC9]
and the people lived in
constant fear of them...@0003
[0ACA]
3 seperate islandsア Fibernia,@0080@0004@0003
[0ACB]
Caledonia,@0080@0004@0003
[0ACC]
@0080@0004and Dia.@0003
All of these islands are rich
in mineral resources,@0003
and mining has become a large industry.@0003
The largest mine is located in
@0080@0004Mt. Ebrakhm, in the north of Fibernia.@0003
@0080@0004Roy turned his forces towards
Ebrakhm hoping to gather some information
@0003on the bandits.@0003

[0ACD]
To get to Mt. Ebrakhm, one must go
past the castle that is located in @0003
Ebrakhm valley.@0003
Therefore, Roy sent a messenger to @0080@0004Nord,@0003
the castle owner, to be granted permission
to pass through his lands.@0003
Since Roy and company were there because
of an official request from Etruria,@0003
they didn't think that gaining Nord's@0003
support would be as difficult.@0003
[0ACE]
Roy couldn't believe Lalum's story.@0003
He quickly penned off a letter to @0080@0004Cecilia
letting her know of the horrors happening@0003
on the Western Isles.@0003
He also let her know of the actions that he@0003
planned to take from now on.@0003

After sending the letter, Roy and
company moved towards the mine in@0003
@0080@0004Mt. Ebrakhm to try and rescue the people@0003
[0ACF]
suffering from forced labor.@0003
Etruria had assigned @0080@0004Bishop Oro
of the Elimine Church to supervise@0003
the mine.@0003
Already a large amount of minerals had been
taken, but it seemed they wanted more..@0003
[0AD0]
Ebrakhm... known now as the Mine of Death.@0003
The wails of the people forced into labor
there echo through the mines, like@0003
the howling of ghosts...@0003
[0AD1]

[0AD2]

[0AD3]

[0AD4]
In order to get some information from
the resistance forces about the bandits@0003
@0080@0004on the Western Isles, Roy and company
moved west along the coastline.@0003

[0AD5]
Along the way, they came across@0003
a small village caught in constant
conflict between the resistance group@0003
and the landowner trying to get
rid of them.@0003
[0AD6]

[0AD7]

[0AD8]
The Lycia Alliance Army took Elphin as
a tactician.@0003
@0080@0004Following his advice, they moved south@0003
toward the isle of Caledonia.
Caledonia is one of the main islands@0003
that make up the Western Isles.
The other two are Fibernia and Dhia.@0003
@0080@0004Castle Idina is located on Caledonia. Here,
men from all over the world are rounded up@0003
[0AD9]
and locked in prison cells to be taken
to Mt. Ebrakhm, to the Mines of Death.@0003
[0ADA]
When Roy arrived at Castle Idina,
the situation already looked dire...@0003
[0ADB]

[0ADC]
To rescue the people of the Western Isles,@0003
Roy headed for Djuto, the Isle's largest
city and its capital.@0003

[0ADD]
According to Elphin, Lord Arcard, who was
in charge of supervising the Western Isles,@0003
was an Etrurian of high nobility, but not
of high importance to the Etrurian@0003
government.@0003

[0ADE]
Roy was still worried about Etruria's response
to his attacking the capital,@0003
@0080@0004but to rescue the people, he had
to get rid of Arcard as soon as possible.@0003
[0ADF]

[0AE0]

[0AE1]

[0AE2]

[0AE3]

[0AE4]
Following Elphin's lead, Roy
headed for the cave near Djuto@0003
to obtaian the Divine Weapon.

[0AE5]
But Roy and company weren't the@0003
only ones who knew of the cave.@0003
Yet another battle was awaiting them...@0003

[0AE6]

[0AE7]

[0AE8]
The coup d'etat at Aquleia quickly
spread out to the rest of Etruria.@0003

[0AE9]
Cecilia escaped with Guinevere from Aquleia.
She also formed an Anti-Coup d'etat@0003
group and traveled around Etruria
fighting the rebel forces.@0003
@0080@0004However, the rebel forces had Bern on
their side.@0003
@0080@0004King Mordred had been taken hostage,@0003
which led @0080@0004@0080@0004"Great General" Douglas and@0003
@0080@0004"Knight General" Percival to be forced onto
the rebels' side. With these powerful@0003
forces on their side, the rebels
gradually began to push the@0003
Anti-Coup d'etat group of of Etruria.@0003 
[0AEA]
The Anti-Coup d'etat forces had been
driven into an old castle on the island@0003
of @0080@0004Misul to the west of Etruria.@0003
[0AEB]
Roy had learned that Cecilia had been
forced back by the Coup d'etat.@0003
[0AEC]
In response, Roy headed for Misul.@0003
[0AED]
Meanwhile, the Anti-Coup d'etat group
was under attack by a joint force of@0003
Coup d'etat forces and Bern's troops.@0003
It would only be a matter of time before
the Anti-Coup d'etat forces were defeated...@0003
[0AEE]

[0AEF]

[0AF0]

[0AF1]

[0AF2]

[0AF3]
After rescuing Guinevere and Cecilia, Roy
headed towards the Nabata desert, following@0003
@0080@0004Sophia's lead.@0003

[0AF4]
According to Sophia, there was a
hidden oasis in the desert,@0003
and that's where her village, Arcadia,
was located.@0003
However, at that time, Arcadia was
under attack by Bern's forces.@0003
Their aim may be the Dragons
that are said to inhabit the village.@0003

[0AF5]
Although the Lycia Alliance Army moved
as quickly as they could towards Arcadia,@0003
a vicious sandstorm stood in their way.@0003
[0AF6]
In the hidden village, Arcadia,
stands an ancient temple.@0003
One of the divine weapons
is said to be hidden in it.@0003
Roy and company were quick to
follow Bern's troops,@0003
who had already found their way
into the temple...@0003
[0AF7]

[0AF8]

[0AF9]

[0AFA]
After saving the hidden vilage of Arcadia,
Roy's army found their way out of@0003
the desert, following Igrene's lead.
Now, they turned toward Etruria@0080@0004to confront@0003

[0AFB]
the Coup d'etat forces. At this point, a@0003
a disturbing message came from
the Elder of Arcadia.@0003

[0AFC]
Apparently, Fa, the little Dragon girl, had
left Arcadia, following Roy. If she were to@0003
fall into the hands of the Coup d'etat
forces or of Bern, who stood behind them,@0003
it would be a disaster.@0003

[0AFD]
Bent on finding Fa, Roy moved his@0003
forces toward a small fort
near the Etrurian border.@0003
[0AFE]

[0AFF]

[0B00]
After rescuing Fa,@0003
@0080@0004Roy headed for Aquleia.@0003

[0B01]
The capital of Etruria,@0003
Aquleia is also the largest,
most prosperous city on the continent.@0003
@0080@0004Preparing for the Lycia Alliance Army's
attack, the Coup d'etat army concentrated@0003
forces in Aquleia. Originally they had
planned on using the garrison of the city@0003
for defense, but since the @0080@0004Elimine Church
had turned to Roy's side, the Coup d'etat@0003
Army had no choice but to retreat to the
castle and take post there instead for fear@0003
that the Church may have encouraged the
city denizens to protest.@0003
[0B02]
The Elimine Church was started by "Saint
Elimine, one of the Eight Heroes. This@0003
religious organization had many followers,
primarily in @0080@0004Bern and Etruria.@0003
@0080@0004Roy had gained the Church's support
in attacking Aquleia.@0003
However, @0080@0004Narshen and his elite troops@0003
were waiting for Roy inside the castle.@0003

[0B03]

[0B04]

[0B05]

[0B06]

[0B07]

[0B08]

[0B09]
At the request of King Mordred, Roy
headed for the Tower of the Saint on@0003
the outskirts of Aquleia.
@0080@0004The Tower of the Saint was a place of@0003
worship for Saint Elimine, one of the
Eight Heroes, and in the tower lay@0003
various holy object relating to her.@0003
However, this sacred tower was now
@0080@0004@0080@0004under the control of Bishop Windam,@0003
who had rebelled against the Elimine
Church by Roartz's orders.@0003
[0B0A]
After Roy captured Aquleia, other Etrurian
forces flocked to Anti Coup d'etat group,@0003
forcing out the Coup d'etat Militia.
Roartz and Arcard were driven out of@0003
@0080@0004Etruria and fled @0080@0004north to Ilia, @0080@0004
which was under Bern's control.@0003
@0080@0004Ilia, or the Frozen Highlands, is a
land with short summers and long winters.@0003
[0B0B]
With little arable land, the
nation's main source of income@0003
was sending mercenaries out to
fight for pay.@0003
[0B0C]
The now free Kingdom of Etruria
joined its forces with the Lycia Alliance Army.@0003
Now a joint force under the name of the@0003
@0080@0004Etrurian Army, their first mission was@0003
to enter Ilia to finish off the Coup d'etat
Forces. After that, they would launch direct@0003
@0080@0004attacks on Bern. @0080@0004Roy, nominated as leader of
of the Etrurian Army, had@0003
the powerful support of the
Elimine Church, getting the@0003
people on his side.@0003

[0B0D]
However, Roy had to face the freezing
cold of Ilia, as well as the@0003
@0080@0004elite troops under General Murdock,@0003
the leader of the 3 Dragon Lords.
In addition, some of the powerful@0003
Ilian Knights had turned to Bern's side.@0003
@0080@0004As a start, Roy headed for Castle
Raemy, located on the Ilian border.@0003
[0B0E]

[0B0F]

[0B10]

[0B11]

[0B12]

[0B13]

[0B14]

[0B15]

[0B16]

[0B17]
After defeating Arcard, Roy moved
east deep into the frozen lands of Ilia.@0003
@0080@0004Soon, they entered the thick forests
that characterize Ilia's central land.@0003
@0080@0004However, a general of Bern,
Bishop Martel, was waiting for them@0003
@0080@0004with an ancient spell that was
said to have been lost centuries ago...@0003

[0B18]

[0B19]

[0B1A]

[0B1B]

[0B1C]

[0B1D]
After defeating Martel and making it
through the forest,@0003
@0080@0004Roy and company faced the blizzards that
are common of Ilia's winters.@0003
@0080@0004Ilia's harsh weather has been a natural
defense in itself against invaders.@0003
@0080@0004Coupled with Ilia's greatest natural weapon,
Sigune, captain of the Pegasus Knight@0003
@0080@0004Squad that had turned to Bern, was
preparing to attack Roy.@0003
[0B1E]

[0B1F]

[0B20]

[0B21]

[0B22]
After defeating Sigune,
@0080@0004Roy headed for Edessa,@0003
located in the northeast of Ilia.@0003
[0B23]
Castle Edessa, owned by @0080@0004Zealot, leader of
the Ilian Mercenary knights, once served as@0003
headquarters of the Pegasus Knight teams@0003
as well.@0003
@0080@0004However, with Zealot gone, Bern saw its
chance and attacked the castle, forcing@0003
the Mercenary and Pegasus Knights into
submission.@0003
Castle Edessa was @0080@0004Murdock's headquarters,@0003
but since Murdock had returned to Bern,@0003
@0080@0004
Roartz was put in charge.@0003
Alarmed by the Etrurian Army's
speed in advancing to Edessa,@0003
Roartz hurriedly contacted the
various Ilian knight groups asking@0003
them for aid.
However, their replies were not promising.@0003
[0B24]

[0B25]

[0B26]

[0B27]

[0B28]

[0B29]

[0B2A]
After taking back Castle Eldessa,
Roy turned his troops toward the ancient ruins@0003
located on the outskirts of the town.
There is a high chance that a@0003
Divine Weapon is hidden there.@0003

[0B2B]

[0B2C]

[0B2D]

[0B2E]
After Roy captured Aquleia, other Etrurian
powers slowly began to change their@0003
views and express their anti Coup d'etat
opinions. Driven away from their palace,@0003
@0080@0004Roartz @0080@0004and Arcard fled to@0080@0004
Sacae, which was still under Bern's control.@0003

[0B2F]
Sacae is the vast plain-covered
land in the center of the continent.@0003
Before Bern invaded, the various tribes
there led nomadic lives.@0003
[0B30]
The Etrurian army joined the Lycia Alliance
Army to form a joint Etruria-Lycia@0003
Union army. The decision was to head
@0080@0004for Sacae to get rid of the remaining@0003
Coup d'etat forces and also attack @0080@0004Bern,
who was behind them.@0003
@0080@0004Thinking that some Etrurian knight
groups would not approve of being seen@0003
under the Lycia Alliance Army, Roy
oficially named the new Union the@0003
"Etrurian Army" and became its commander.@0003
Roy led the division responsible@0003
for entering Sacae.@0003
[0B31]
The Sacae people are wary of outsiders
in the first place, but even worse,@0003
@0080@0004Brenya,@0003
another one of the Three Dragon Lords,
had gotten the largest tribe in Sacae,@0003
the Djute clan, under submission.
@0080@0004The warriors of the Djute tribe@0003
and Brenya's elite Bern troops stood in
front of Roy as he set foot on Sacae's soil.@0003

[0B32]

[0B33]

[0B34]

[0B35]

[0B36]

[0B37]

[0B38]

[0B39]

[0B3A]

[0B3B]
After defeating Arcard, Roy crossed
the border and @0080@0004entered the land of Sacae.@0003
After Bern invaded, the Djute clan,@0003
the most powerful clan in Sacae, became@0003
its servant. Most of those clans
who stood up against the two joint@0003
forces had already been
decimated.@0003
@0080@0004Although the "Silver Wolf" Dayan,
the leader of the Kutolah clan,@0003
had been retaliating with guerilla
tactics, the situation was dire.@0003
@0080@0004Sacae had basically become
a territory of Bern.@0003
Now, as Roy set foot on the plains
of Sacae, the warriors of the @0080@0004Djute@0003
clan stood in his path.@0003 
[0B3C]

[0B3D]

[0B3E]

[0B3F]

[0B40]

[0B41]

[0B42]

[0B43]
After defeating the Djute Tribe, Roy moved
@0080@0004toward Bulgar, the largest city in Sacae.@0003
[0B44]
As a center of commerce between Etruria,
Bern, and Ilia, Bulgar has had a history@0003
of being a free city without a rule.
However, with Bern's invasion,@0003
@0080@0004
Advisor Roartz now had control of@0003
Bulgar under Bern's protection.@0003
[0B45]
@0080@0004Roy approached Bulgar to liberate it and to
gain some useful information on invading Bern.@0003
[0B46]

[0B47]

[0B48]
After meeting Niime, the "Hermit on
the Mountain", the mysteries of Bern's@0003
Dragons were slowly beginning to unfold.@0003
With more unknowns still needing verification,
@0080@0004Roy directed his troops towards a large@0003
manor on the outskirts of Bulgar.@0003
[0B49]
There, Advisor Roartz of Etruria@0003
was preparing his defenses against Roy...@0003
[0B4A]

[0B4B]
Roy headed towards the ruins in Sacae,@0003
@0080@0004after the Divine Weapon.@0003
@0080@0004However, the remaining forces of the
Djute clan were waiting for Roy in the ruins...@0003 
[0B4C]

[0B4D]

[0B4E]
After surviving many hardships,
Roy finally set foot on Bern's soil.@0003
[0B4F]
@0080@0004Guinevere guided Roy toward the@0003
Temple of Seals, but in their path
stood Bern's elite troops,@0003
the strongest army on the continent,
led by @0080@0004Lord Murdock, the smartest@0003
and strongest general in Bern.@0003
[0B50]
Etruria and Bern, the two leading
forces on the continent, out for@0003
all-out war. The longest and bloodiest day
yet to be seen by Elibe was about to begin...@0003
[0B51]

[0B52]

[0B53]

[0B54]
Roy ventured deep inside the Temple 
of Seals.@0003
Apparently, there was something else
hidden there other than the Sword of@0003
Seals.@0003
@0080@0004However, @0080@0004  Pereth, once of Murdock's best
troops leaders, was already inside@0003
the temple and waiting to attack Roy.@0003
[0B55]

[0B56]

[0B57]
After obtaining the Sword of Seals,
@0080@0004Roy directed his troops towards Bern's@0003
@0080@0004capital, where King Zephiel was waiting.@0003
@0080@0004Inside the castle, Zephiel awaited with@0003
his personal guards at hand.@0003

[0B58]
Roy prepared to charge the castle
to end this war, and to bring@0003
peace to Elibe again...@0003
[0B59]

[0B5A]
 
[0B5B]

[0B5C]
Bern surrendered with King Zephiel's death.
The great war that shook the lands of Elibe@0003
@0080@0004was over.
However, Roy's battle was not.@0003
[0B5D]
Roy continued to search for the Dark
Priestess, who could be the Dark Dragon.@0003
@0080@0004Following the light emitted by the Divine
Weapons, Roy headed for the Dragon Temple.@0003
@0080@0004However, waiting for Roy in front of the
@0080@0004temple was Brenya, the one remaining@0003
Dragon Lord of Bern. She had rounded up the
remaining troops and was waiting@0003
to attack Roy.@0003
[0B5E]
A battle with the now dead Kingdom of Bern...@0003
Roy already had a heavy heart at@0003
having to battle these "ghosts".@0003
[0B5F]

[0B60]
lcaring.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
Yuno was pretty worried about
you and Thany.@0003
Knowing you, I would think you'd
be all right.@0003
But you know Yuno,
she's a worrier.@0003@0009Yes, I understand.@0003
Our sister was often too soft
on Thany and me.@0003
The day we left was a hectic one,
indeed.@0003
Yuno was constantly fretting over
us, worrying about our meals, and@0003
our clothes...@0003
@000C@0017Haha, that's Yuno.@0003
[0B61]

[0B62]

[0B63]

[0B64]

[0B65]

[0B66]
After defeating Bern's remaining
troops, Roy entered the Dragon Temple.@0003
@0080@0004He searched for the Dark
Priestess to prevent the same@0003
@0080@0004tragedy as the Dragon Human@0003
@0080@0004wars from happening again.@0003

[0B67]
Here in the temple, Roy was to
learn the truth of the legends he had@0003
always heard. What Roy was about to hear
was completely different from what@0003
he had always believed to be true...@0003

[0B68]

[0B69]

[0B6A]

[0B6B]
Here in Lycia, Roy, the young heir@0003
[0B6C]
of Pherae, was studying in the great city@0003
[0B6D]
of Ostia to train himself for his
position. Today, his teacher,@0003
@0080@0004General Cecilia of Etruria, is
instructing him on battle tactics...@0003

@000C@0014Your Majesty,@0005
our troops are ready!@0005
@0009@0012Good.
I will be right there.@0005
[0BA3]
@0009@0010@0149@000C@0010@014B
@0009All right, let's go@0005

@000CYes I am, Alan! @0005

@0009@0010@0119@000B@0010@0102
@000B@0013@0017Oh, it's Lance! @0005
What's the matter? @0005
Why are you in such a hurry?@0005
@0009Master Roy! Bandits have appeared@0005
and are attacking the castle@0005
as we speak!
@0005 
[0BA6]
@0008@0080@000C@0010@0102Let's go, Marcus! @0005 @0005
[0BA7]
@0010@011CMaster Roy, swords are weak@0005
against spears.
Don't do anything rash.@0005

@0008@0080@000B@0010@010FMaster Roy, please don't move. @0005
I'll heal your wounds...@0005

One thousand years after the great
war between Dragons and men known
as the Scouring...
@0005 
[0BCE]
Mankind was beginning to
prosper once more.@0005 
[0BCF]
However, a sudden invasion from
the east threw the continent
into war again.@0005 
[0BD0]
Those who started the war...
Those who suffered...
Those who stood up...@0005 
[0BD1]
Countless people fought to the
death to protect what they
believed in.@0005 
[0BD2]
This is a story of a group of
heroes who withstood the test
of time during this age of suffering...@0005 
[0BD3]
@0009@0010@0150@000C@0010@01CB@0009@0017B-Boss!
An army's invading our cave!@0003
@000CWhat!@0003
How many of them are there?@0003
@0009Dunno, Boss.
I hope there aren't too many of them...@0003
@000CThat's strange...@0003
The Lycia marquesses should be having
bigger problems than dealing with@0003
bandits like us.@0003
@0009Well?@0003
What do we do?@0003
@000CThey probably don't know much about
this cave, anyway.@0003
Just lure them into stepping on the
floor tiles where hot lava spurts@0003
up and get rid of 'em.@0003
[0BD4]
@0009@0010@0122@0009@0017Roy, over here!@0003
The Divine Weapon is located on
the other side of this lava pit.@0003
@000C@0010@0102Lilina, are you all right?@0003
Have you calmed down?@0003
@0009@0017Well...@0017maybe I'm not fully all right,
but now isn't the time to be sad.@0003
I need to protect Ostia,
like my father before me.@0003
@000CAll right...
@0017Good for you, Lilina.@0003@000C@0011
@0009I'm okay because you're
with me, Roy...@0003
@000C@0010@0102@0017What?@0003
Did you just say something?@0003
@0009@0017No, nothing.@0003
Anyway, I'll tell you what I know
about this Divine Weapon.@0003
The one here is the sword that was used
by Roland, one of the 'Eight Heroes.'@0003
@000C@0017That Roland... is that King Roland,
the first king of Ostia?@0003
@0009@0017Right, he's our ancestor.@0003
This sword is called 'The Blazing Sword,'
or the Durandal.@0003
@000C@0017The Durandal...the name has a
strange echo to it.@0003
So Roland used the Durandal to fight
the Dragons during the Scouring.@0003
@0009@0017That's how the legend goes.@0003
They also say that after the war ended,
Roland returned to his hometown of Ostia.@0003
He raised the Durandal high above his head,
and the land that had become barren after@0003
the war suddenly became lush with
vegetation and life again.@0003
@000C@0017Wow... that must be some sword.@0003
@0009@0017Well, it's a weapon that can defeat Dragons.
It must have some special powers in it.@0003
@000C@0017Yes.@0003
...Oh yeah, I heard that a group
of bandits has made its base here.@0003
Is it going to be all right?@0003
@0009?@0003
Is what going to be all right?@0003
@000CI mean, there's always the chance that
they have might have taken the Durandal.@0003
@0009@0017No, don't worry.@0003
Only those who are Roland's successors know
how to remove the Durandal from its sheath.@0003
@000COh, okay.
Then everything's fine.@0003
@0017All we have to do is get rid of
the bandits and obtain the Durandal.@0003
[0BD5]
@0010@01CBSigh.@0003
What are you guys doing in a
place like this?@0003
Oh well, but since you're
already here...@0003
I can't let you guys go,
can I?@0003
[0BD6]
@0010@01CB@0017Crap...@0003
I knew this would happen...@0003
[0BD7]
@0009@0010@0122@0017Roy!
Here it is!@0003
@000C@0010@0102@0017So this is the Durandal...
It's a very large sword.@0003
I don't think many of us are
going to be able to swing it.@0003
@0009But history has it that Roland
was a small man.@0003
I think it's the person skill in the
sword that determines whether or not@0003
he can use.@0003
@000CThen if I become better with my
sword, I can use it as well?@0003
@0009Well... maybe.@0003
@000CMaybe?@0003
Come on...at least say 'probably.'@0003
@0009Hee hee!@0003
[0BD8]
@0009@0010@0154@0017Master Roy, here it is!
There was a sword under the altar.@0003
It was a task to get it out,
but we have it now.@0003
@000C@0010@0102This is the Durandal...@0003
But was it worth losing Lilina...?@0003
[0BD9]
@000C@0010@01D3@0017So this is the end of the caaave?@0003
Treeaasure...
Where are you...@0003
Answer meee...@0003
@0009@0010@0150
Boss... you sure about this?@0003
Bern told us to block the entrance
to the cave.@0003
If they catch us now, we'll be
sent back to prison!@0003
@000C@0080@000DIdiooot!@0009@0080@000A@0003
@000BWe're gonna bury this cave
anywaaay...@0003
Sooo they ain't gonna know that we
took the treeaasure...@0003
If we bury the cave without taking the
treasure, no one's ever going to be@0003
able to fiiind it...@0003
Have ya ever thought about how the
treasure would feel theeen!@0003
@0008Well...
'Guess you're right.@0003
@0008@0011@0009@0010@0151Boss!@0003
There's an army stationed outside
the cave!@0003
@000BWhaaat?@0003
So they think they're going to take
our treasure, do they?@0003
Have the boys near the entrance take
take them ooouut...@0003
And grab all the treasure chests...@0003
They're mine nooowww!@0003
[0BDA]
@000C@0010@0102A Divine Weapon lies in this cave...@0003@0002
It's pretty dark in here.@0003
@0009@0010@012BAccording to a scholar in Djuto,
if there is a Divine Weapon in here,@0003
it would most surely be the Armads,
the 'Axe of Lightning'.@0003
@000CArmads...@0003
An axe, not a sword this time.@0003
@0009The Armads was used by 'Durban the
Berserker', the largest and most@0003
muscular of the Eight Heroes.@0003
A blow from his axe must have
been quite a sight to see.@0003
@000CElphin, you certainly know a lot about
the Eight Heroes and the Divine Weapons.@0003
@0009I'm a bard.
I know lots of myths and legends.@0003
@000CI see.@0003
I want to hear them, when we have
the time.@0003
@0009Of course.@0003
...Master Roy, it seems we have
company in this cave.@0003
@000C@0017We do?@0003
@0009@0017There are also some strange
fumes coming out of the cave walls.@0003
We must proceed with caution.@0003
[0BDB]
@0010@01D3Daaaahhhhhh!@0003@0002
Rah!@0003
[0BDC]
@0010@01D3Guh...@0003
[0BDD]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102@0017Where is the Divine Weapon?@0003
@0009Hmm...@0003
I can hear wind coming from behind
the throne.@0003
@000CWhat?
I can't hear it...@0003
@0080@000DThere's a niche... between the
floor and wall.@0003@0002
Oh!
It opened!@0003@0002
...So this is the Divine Weapon?
That axe is huge.@0003
@0009The Armads...@0003
So this is what Durban the Berserker
used.@0003
It certainly seems fit for a
mighty warrior.@0003
[0BDE]
@0009@0010@0152@0017Master Roy, here it is!@0003
There's a large axe behind the
throne!@0003
@000C@0010@0102This is the Armads...@0003
Durban's Axe...@0003
[0BDF]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@01C6@0017Haven't you found the
Divine Weapon yet!@0003
@0009Yes, we think it is lying inside
this altar, but it won't open...@0003
@000C@0080@000DBreak it, force it open, or
do whatever!@0003
We do not have much time.@0003
@0009@0080@000ABut we must also deal with the
enemies that have entered the Temple!@0003
We don't have enough manpower to
use force on the altar!@0003
@000BThen we must get rid of
the enemy first.@0003
Then we can examine the altar
with leisure.@0003
[0BE0]
@000C@0010@0102@0017This is the underground of
the desert?@0003
There's so much... water.@0003
@0009@0010@012DThis is close to a large source of
groundwater...@0003
That's why plants and animals can
live here...@0003
@000CI see.@0003
So that's why you were able to build a
village here.@0003
Still, how did you find such a convenient
place like this?@0003
@0009Athos...@0003
The "Archsage" Athos is
the one who led us here...@0003
@000C@0017What?@0003
Do you mean the Athos of the
Eight Heroes?@0003
@0009@0017Yes...@0003
After the Scouring...
Master Athos traveled around Elibe...@0003
At the end of his journey, he arrived at
a village in which people and Dragons@0003
lived together...@0003
But he said that... it would only be
a matter of time before it was found@0003
by other people...@0003
@000CSo he led you here...@0003
@0009Yes... and he hid his
Divine Weapon inside this Temple...@0003
@000CAnd...
Can we use his Divine Weapon?@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
Master Athos said that we were to
use his weapon to protect Arcadia...@0003
And if you use it...
it would be to protect us...@0003
@000CAll right.
Thank you.@0003
@0009Some of the pathways of this temple
will suddenly sink into the water...@0003
Please be careful...@0003
[0BE1]
@0010@01C6I...wasn't expecting you to
fight so well against all of us.@0003
[0BE2]
@0010@01C6Where... did you learn...
to fight... like this...?@0003
[0BE3]
@0009@0010@012D@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017It is here...
Inside this altar...@0003
@000C@0080@000D...@0003@0002
It won't open...@0003
@0009This altar is made... so that
only those of the village may@0003
open it...@0003
So please allow me...@0003
@000B@0080@000EYes.@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0016......@0003@0007@0002
@0016There...
There is the Divine Weapon.@0003
@000CThe one that Athos used?
Then...@0003
@000AYes...@0003
The "Infernal Element," Forblaze...@0003
[0BE4]
@0009@0010@0152@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017I think the book is inside the
altar, Master Roy.@0003
@000CCan you get it out?@0003
@0009I sent some people to ask the
villagers about it.@0003
@000CAll right.
But don't force them.@0003
If they don't want to give it
to us, then we'll leave it here.@0003
@0009Yes, sir.@0003@0011
[0BE5]
@0009@0010@0152@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017Master Roy!@0003
The villagers helped us remove the book
from the altar!@0003
Here it is.@0003
@000CWhat is this?@0003
@0009@0011@0009@0010@012B
...If the Archsage Athos hid it,
it must be the Forblaze, the@0003@0002
'Infernal Element'@0003
The legends say that no one
could escape its fiery wrath.@0003
@000C...We must be cautious with it.@0003
[0BE6]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@01D5@0017Lord Roartz fled!?@0003
Then what would happen to me, who turned
against the Church and took over this@0003
tower?@0003
@0009Sir, Lord Roartz's message is that he
'Doesn't want to waste time dealing@0003
with useless bishops who cannot even
tame the Elimine Church.'@0003@000CThat is because that damned Yodel
got in my way...@0003
@0009Well yes...
But even if you tell me about it...@0003
@000C...All right, fine...
Then this is our last mission.@0003
If we are to die, then the Lycia
Alliance Army is going down with us!@0003
Prepare the 'Heavenly Arrows'!@0003
@0009Please wait!@0003
If we use that, it will hit our
allies as well.@0003
@000C@0080@000DQuiet!
I do the ordering around here!@0009@0080@000A@0003@0008@0011
@000B...I shall show them...
Hehehe...!@0003
[0BE7]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0102@0009This is the Tower of the Saint.@0003
Saint Elimine's Weapon, the Aureola
Spell book, lies here.@0003
@000CThank you, Lord Douglas.@0003
You are helping us, who were your
enemies just a while earlier.@0003
@0009You do not have to thank me.@0003
The king ordered me to help you.
Do not worry about it.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Besides, you are saviors of Etruria.@0003
It is an honor to be able to fight@0003
alongside you.@0003
@000CLord Douglas...@0003
[0BE8]

[0BE9]
@0010@01D5Die!@0003@0002
All of you!
Everything shall be destroyed!@0003
[0BEA]
@0010@01D5Hahaha!
Haha...Ha...@0003
[0BEB]
@0009@0010@0152@000C@0010@0102@0009Master Roy,
I think we found the spell book.@0003@0011
@000CLord Douglas,
is this...?@0003
@0009@0010@010AYes, this is it.@0003
This is the 'Pinnacle of Light,' the
Aureola spell book, Saint Elimine's@0003
weapon.@0003
@000CMay we use it?@0003
@0009The king said to use anything in
the tower that you found useful.@0003
And the Elimine Church is on our
side as well.@0003
If we still have trouble, then I can
negotiate.@0003
@000CAll right.
Thank you, Lord Douglas.@0003
[0BEC]
@0009@0010@0152@000C@0010@0102@0009Master Roy, I think we
have found the spellbook.@0003@0011
@000C...This must be the Aureola,
the 'Pinnacle of Light.'@0003
Merlinus,@0003@0009@0010@0154
@000CI want you to give this to
the Elimine Church.@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
But the king said we could use anything
we found in the tower.@0003
@000C@0017This is the spell book their
saint used.@0003
It would be disrespectful to take it
Without their permission.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
[0BED]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@0102
@0009Master Roy.@0003
@000CBishop Yodel?
What is wrong?@0003
@0009About the Aureola...@0003
@000CAh, yes.@0003
I will return it to the church
immediately.@0003
@0009Please don't.
We want you to take it.@0003
@000C@0017...Are you sure?@0003
@0009@0017What Saint Elimine truly wished
for was peace.@0003
Please take it and end this war.@0003
@000CAll right.
I will use it with care.@0003
[0BEE]
@0009@0010@0152@000C@0010@01E0@0009@0017Lord Teck!
The enemy is advancing!@0003
@000C@0017There is no need to panic.@0003
These ruins are surrounded by plenty
of enforcement.@0003
They won't be able to come in so easily.@0003
@0009@0017But the enemy has defeated the Ilian
troops and our troops one after another!@0003
We do not have a high chance of winning...!@0003
@000C@0017We do not have to win.@0003
Lord Murdock said that all we must do
is defend this place.@0003
We must hold out until the enemy gives
up and leaves.@0003

@000C@0010@0102@0017The Divine Weapon lies in here...@0003
@0009@0010@0132@000CZealot, have you heard about this
place?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
I believe that the Marte, the Spear of
Snow and Ice resides in these ruins.@0003
@000CSpear of Snow and Ice...@0003
@0009Barigan the 'Faithful' used it
during the Scouring.@0003
@000CBarigan?
All knights know about him.@0003
I used to hear a lot about him
during my studies.@0003
He is the finest example of knighthood.@0003

everywhere.@0003
Is there a path leading inside?@0003
@0009Probably the remaining forces of Bern
buried the pathways to defend themselves.@0003
@000CThen they must not have had much
time to do it...@0003
Maybe the walls are weak at certain
areas.@0003

Bern's troops are escaping.@0003
@000COh.@0003
All right.@0003
@0009All right?
We must attack them now.@0003
@000CNo, don't.@0003
They are fleeing.
They don't have anymore will to fight.@0003
@0009But...@0003
@000CThey have families as well.@0003
There's no need to fight more

@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@0102@0017There is a Divine Weapon under here?@0003
@0009Yes, I think so.@0003
I have only heard rumors within the army,

that was placed to protect the Temple of
Seals from intruders.@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@012BThis place is guarded by Bern's troops

@000CYes.@0003
We're going up against Zephiel soon.@0003

@0009Yes.@0003
They are so well designed that it would
be impossible for us to find them.@0003
Perhaps thieves would be better at
finding them...@0003
Please be careful.@0003
@000CYes, Princess.
We will be careful.@0003
[0C04]
@0010@01C7
Darkness from an age
long forgotten...@0003@0002
I will show you its power.@0003
[0C05]
@0010@01C7
@0017Dark...@0003
It is getting so dark...@0003
[0C06]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@012B@000C@0017Elphin, do you know what this
spell book is?@0003
@0009...It is probably the Apocalypse
spell book.@0003
@000CApocalypse?@0003
@0009Yes, it is also known as the
Silencing Darkness.@0003
Bramimond... the most mysterious
of the Eight Heroes, used it.@0003
@000CBrammimond...@0003
I only know his name.@0003
@0009We don't even know if Bramimond
is male or female, old or young.@0003
None of the old scrolls say
anything specific about Bramimond.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
@0009@0016.....@0003
@0009@0011@000A@0010@0157@0016Roy, is something wrong?@0003
@000CNo, I was just thinking.@0003
@000AAbout what?@0003
@000CI was wondering why there is always some
kind of trap where a Divine Weapon lies.@0003@000A...Perhaps it is to warn people that their
power is too great to be dealt with lightly.@0003
@000CBut still...
The traps are so carefully set.@0003@0002
There must be other reasons.@0003
@000A@0016.....@0016@0003
@000A@0011@0009@0010@012B
...I wondered about the same thing.@0003
Perhaps I shall look into it.@0003
@000CYes...
Please.@0003
