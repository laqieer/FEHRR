@000C@0010@0150Boss!@0003
They've all hidden themselves
inside the castle!@0003
@0009@0010@0137Heh. Even Eliwood, the greatest knight in
Lycia, is no match for an illness, it seems.@0003@000CHee hee hee...@0003
You were right when you said
there wouldn't be many soldiers.@0003
They're all getting ready
to defend against Bern!@0003
@0009Of course I was right.
I'm always right, you fool.@0003
But reinforcements could be
here any minute.@0003@0002
All right, you curs, listen up!@0003
Kill everyone in the castle
while we still got time!@0003
Then we can waltz outta
here with all the loot!@0003
[02]
@000C@0010@0151Heh heh, castles ain't the only
places with loot.@0003
Let's go ransack the villages
and take everything they got!@0003
[03]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0156@0009@0017Lord Eliwood!@0003
We're under attack by
bandits from Mount Bolm!@0003
@000CI understand. Thank you, Merlinus...@0003
Blast it! Were I not in this pitiful state,
I would take care of them all myself...!@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@0122@0012Lord Eliwood...?@0003
@000C@0014Lilina, you must hide yourself.@0003
This castle is going to
become a war zone.@0003
@0008@0080@000B@0012No, my lord.
I can fight, too!@0003
@000C@0013Don't be absurd.@0003
I couldn't face Hector if something
happened to you in my own castle.@0003
@0009@0012My father?
But...@0003
@000C@0013@0017It's going to be all right.@0003
Roy should be here any moment, so we
just need to hold our own until then.@0003
He'll drive off these dastards.@0003@0009@0011@000C@0017
[04]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0017Merlinus!@0003
Send a messenger to Roy to let
him know the current situation!@0003
We need his help!@0003
@0009@0013Y-yes, milord!@0003@0011
[05]

[06]
@0009@0010@0119@000B@0010@0102@000B@0013@0017Oh, it's Lance!
What's the matter?@0003
Why are you in such a hurry?@0003
@0009Lord Roy!@0003
Bandits have appeared and are attacking
the castle as we speak!@0003
@000D@0010@0118No!
Is the marquess unharmed?@0003
@0009@0014He's inside, defending against
the bandits' attack.@0003
But I don't know how long he can
last with his illness...!@0003
@000D@0011@000D@0010@0109@0012Excuse me. Lance, is it?
Is Lady Lilina safe?@0003
@0009@0014You must be a knight of Ostia.
Lady Lilina is in the castle.@0003
She should be all right.@0003
She's with Lord Eliwood after all,
but he can't last forever.@0003
@000D@0011@000BNo...@0003
I shouldn't have let Lilina go to
the castle before me.@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@010B@0013Lord Roy, regret won't solve anything!
We must retake the castle!@0003
@000A@0010@011CWolt is right.
We must make haste!@0003
@000B@0012Yes, you're right.
This is no time to despair.@0003@0002
@0013@0008@0011@000A@0011@000BVery well. To arms then!@0003
Our target is the castle!
We must rescue everyone!@0003
[07]
@000C@0010@0150Boss!@0003
They've all hidden themselves
inside the castle!@0003
@0009@0010@0137Heh, even Eliwood, the greatest knight in
Lycia, is no match for an illness, it seems.@0003@000CHee hee hee...@0003
You were right when you said
there wouldn't be many soldiers.@0003
They're all getting ready
to defend against Bern!@0003
@0009Of course I was right.
I'm always right, you fool.@0003
But reinforcements could be
here any minute.@0003
All right, you curs, listen up!@0003
Kill everyone in the castle
while we still got time!@0003
Then we can waltz outta
here with all the loot!@0003
[08]
@000C@0010@0137@0013@0017Curses!
Reinforcements already!@0003
But they'll have to go through
me to get into the castle!@0003
[09]

[0A]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015C@0013@0017Are you knights going
to the castle?@0003
I know this isn't much...@0003
But please accept this money
on behalf of all of us.@0003
Use it well!@0003
[0B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015F@0014We're all doomed...@0003
Soldiers from Bern have
crossed the border...@0003
They laid an awful attack.@0003
And even if the allied lords
strike back, Lord Eliwood...@0003
He can't even stand anymore...@0003
[0C]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0164@0014Listen!@0003
If you wanna do well in battle
you'd better use terrain wisely.@0003
For example, if you're in a forest
the trees will cover you.@0003
That'll teach your enemies who
they're dealing with.@0003
[0D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015D@0017Money is vital for any army.@0003
If you don't have any, you won't be
able to replace your broken weapons.@0003
And you can't fight
without weapons!@0003
[0E]
@0010@0137@0017You bumbling idiots!@0003
You can't take down a
few pathetic knights?!@0003
[0F]
@0010@0137@0017Wh...what the...?!
S...so strong...@0003
[10]

[11]
@000C@0010@0102@0012@0017Father!
Lilina!@0003
@000A@0010@0156@0017Roy, is that you?@0003
@0008@0010@0122Roy!@0003
@000C@0013I'm so glad to see you both!
Thank goodness you're unharmed.@0003
@0008@0011@000A@0012Thanks for the
rescue, Roy.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Of course, Father.
How is your health?@0003
@000A@0017Well enough.
I've some life in me yet.@0003@0002
@0017But Roy, do you know why
I called you back here?@0003
@000C@0014I'm to take over your role by
leading the soldiers of Pherae.@0003
We must join the rest of the Lycian
Army to defend our people.@0003
@000AExactly.@0003
As you know, Bern has
commenced an invasion of Lycia.@0003
We are honorbound to follow
the vows of our allegiance.@0003
Lycia needs every lord's army,
and we must oblige.@0003
@000C@0012Of course.@0003
@000A@0014I'm truly sorry to interrupt your
studies and force you into this war,@0003
but I'm not well... I'm in no
condition to lead an army.@0003
@000C@0012Father...@0003@001C
@0008@0010@0122@0014@0017Lord Eliwood!
I'll go with Roy!@0003
My father leads
Lycia's largest army.@0003
And I'm certain my magic will
be of help to Roy...@0003@001C
@000ANo, Lilina.
You must return to Ostia.@0003
@000C@0011@0008@0011@000B@0010@0122@0012@0017...Why?@0003@0005
@000A@0014@0017With Hector preparing for battle, there is
no one sitting on the throne of Ostia.@0003
It must be an uneasy feeling for the
people not to have a sitting lord.@0003
As the daughter of the marquess, you must
take the throne until Hector returns.@0003
That will put the people at ease.@0003
Do you have any objections?@0003
@000B@0012@0017...No, my lord.@0003
@000B@0011@000C@0010@0102@000A@0014@0017Roy, I have arranged a contract with
a group of mercenaries.@0003
You are to meet them at the border to
Bern. Merlinus will accompany you.@0003
He is knowledgable and experienced and
should be of great help.@0003
@000CThank you for everything,
Father.@0003
@000A@0017Don't worry, my son.
I have absolute faith in you!@0003
Fight bravely, and show everyone who
the next marquess of Pherae is!@0003
@000C@0012@0017Yes, Father!@0003@000A@0011@000C@0011
[12]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0109@0009@0012@0017Bors, I have a
favor to ask of you.@0003
@000C@0014@0017You needn't ask, milady.@0003
I will accompany Lord Roy in his travels
and protect him with my very life.@0003
@0009@0013Thank you, Bors.@0003@000C@0011@0009@0011
[13]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017@0005Take care, Roy.@0003
@000C@0017I will.
You too, Lilina.@0003
[14]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0134@000C
Today, Roy, I will instruct you
in basic combat tactics.@0003
[15]
@000C@0010@0134
First, do you see this
moving square?@0003
This is the cursor, which is used
to give commands to soldiers.@0003@0080@0004
Let's begin the mock battle.@0003
I'm sure you have questions, but I'll be
here to advise you as needed.@0003
[16]
@000C@0010@0134
To win any battle, you, Roy, must seize
the enemy's main point of defense.@0003
That could be a castle gate, a throne,
or any number of locations.@0003
The enemy leader's position is
the location you want to seize.@0003
[17]
@0010@0134This is the point you must seize
for this training session.@0003
First, make your way
toward the castle gate.@0003
I'll teach you how to move
yourself around the map.@0003
[18]
@000C@0010@0134Units are soldiers that move
around the field and fight.@0003
Blue units are your allies, and
red units are your enemies.@0003
Let's try moving. Use the
+ Control Pad to move your cursor.@0003
It's already positioned on you,
so you can just press the A Button.@0003
[19]
The blue squares indicate where
you can move.@0003
Use the cursor to select where
to move, and press the A Button.@0003
If you change your mind,
press the B Button to cancel.@0003
Many actions can be cancelled
by pressing the B Button,@0003
so remember that if you
make a mistake.@0003
[1A]
The red squares outside the blue
squares indicate where you can attack.@0003
It appears there's an
enemy unit in a red square.@0003
[1B]
To attack him, move to an area
adjacent to the enemy unit.@0003
Select an area and press
the A Button.@0003
[1C]
Select Attack and
press the A Button.@0003
[1D]
@000C@0010@0134If an enemy survives your first attack,
it may perform a counterattack.@0003
A unit with much higher speed than
its opponent will attack twice.@0003
[1E]
Look at the red zone,
or the attack range.@0003
For you it was only one space,
but for this unit it's two spaces.@0003
That's because Wolt can attack
from a distance with his bow.@0003
Different weapons can attack
in different ways.@0003
[1F]
Wolt can engage in indirect
combat with his bow.@0003
[20]
To attack with a bow,@0003
your unit must be 1 space
away from the enemy.@0003
Try moving to one of these
spaces.@0003
[21]
Select Attack from
the menu.@0003
[22]
@000C@0010@0134
That was indirect combat
with a bow.@0003
If the enemy has no weapons
capable of indirect combat,@0003
there's no fear of counterattack.@0003
However, you cannot fire
on adjacent spaces.@0003
If someone moves next to
you and attacks, that's it.@0003
[23]
Some weapons,
such as magic and javelins,@0003
can strike enemies in adjacent squares
as well as those at a distance.@0003
As you can see, the red
zone is extended.@0003
[24]
Now you can attack
with magic.@0003
[25]
You can either attack from close
up or keep your distance.@0003
[26]
Select Attack.@0003
Also, do you remember the
R Button?@0003
You can press the R Button to
see help messages here, too.@0003
[27]

[28]
@000C@0010@0134That was a magic attack.@0003
You can attack from a distance to avoid
counterattacks from many foes,@0003
and you can also attack from an adjacent
square to avoid counterattacks from bows.@0003
I think you'll find magic to be
highly versatile.@0003
[29]
Choose which weapon to equip.@0003
[2A]
Select the enemy to attack.@0003
If there are multiple enemies
in your attack range,@0003
use your cursor to choose the
enemy you want to attack.@0003
Right now there's only one enemy
in range.@0003
[2B]
Now, press the A Button
to attack!@0003
[2C]
@000C@0010@0134
If a unit takes a hit,@0003
its HP, or hit points,
will be reduced.@0003
If a unit's HP is reduced
to zero, that unit will be lost.@0003
Once a unit is lost,
it's gone for good.@0003
Also, if you lose all your HP,
Roy, the battle is lost.@0003
That means game over.
So be careful.@0003
[2D]

[2E]
Do you see the Visit command?@0003
If you select it and press the A Button,
you can visit the village.@0003
[2F]
@000C@0010@0134Visiting villages may earn you
items or money.@0003
You can use any items you obtain
with the Item command.@0003
[30]

[31]

[32]

[33]
@000C
These are a unit's details.
There are many parameters here,@0003
but I won't bore you by
explaining each one.@0003
If you want to know about the
different values,@0003
press the R Button for
more information.@0003
Also, if you press right and left on the
+ Control Pad on this screen,@0003
you can view additional information,
such as held items and weapon skills.@0003
When you're done, press
the B Button to return to the map.@0003
[34]

[35]
@000C@0010@0134When the enemy's turn is done,
it's your turn again.@0003
The battle proceeds like this
in a turn-by-turn fashion.@0003
[36]
@000C@0010@010BAll right! I'll help
Lord Roy with my bow!@0003
[37]
@0010@0134Roy, the archer Wolt came
to help you.@0003
You're not the only unit
you can move.@0003
You have command over all
of your allies, too,@0003
but remember that you are
responsible for their lives.@0003
And one more thing...@0003
[38]
@0010@0134
Do you see where
the cursor is?@0003
This is the entrance
to a village.@0003
You should inform
the village of the battle.@0003
Once you move to the
entrance of a village,@0003
you can select Visit
to inform them.@0003
[39]
@000C@0010@0122Roy, are you all right?
I'll help you with my magic!@0003
[3A]

[3B]
@000C@0010@0134
Do you think you have a grasp
on the basics of battle now?@0003@0002
Now I'll tell you about one of the
most powerful weapons you have...@0003
Information.@0003
You can press the R Button to 
investigate numerous things.@0003
For example, if you press the R Button while
the cursor is on a unit,@0003
you can view its statistics,
items, and other data.@0003
You can also press the R Button on
commands if you don't understand them.@0003
If there's something you're unsure
of, the R Button is there to help.@0003
[3C]
@0009@0010@0134
You will soon approach
the castle.@0003
Like I said before,
to win,@0003
you have to seize the
castle gate or throne.@0003
In other words, where
the enemy leader is.@0003
Bors is leading the enemy
in this training mission,@0003
so your final task is to
defeat him.@0003
Once you've done that, use
the Seize command on the gate,@0003
and victory will be yours!@0003
[3D]
@000C@0010@0134
Good! You defeated the enemy leader.@0003
Now, Roy, all that's left is for you to
move onto the castle gate and Seize it.@0003
[3E]
Do you see the Seize command?@0003
Select it and press the A Button
to win the battle.@0003
[3F]
The Rescue command allows you
to carry allies to protect them.@0003
A unit can only be rescued if its Con stat
is lower than the rescuer's Aid stat.@0003
You can see a unit's Con and Aid
values on the unit data screen.@0003
While a unit is carrying another,@0003
its combat statistics are lowered
significantly, so be careful.@0003
After rescuing a unit,@0003
you can drop it onto a space by
using the Drop command.@0003
Or if you prefer,@0003
you can pass it to another unit
with the Give or Take commands.@0003
Remember, however, that you can
only perform one command per turn.@0003
[40]
The Trade command allows a unit
to trade items with other units.@0003
If you select the command and
press the A Button,@0003
the two units' inventories will
be displayed.@0003
You may select which items you
want to trade with the A Button.@0003
If you just want to give or
take an item,@0003
trade that item to an empty
space.@0003
If you give all of a unit's
weapons to another unit,@0003
it won't be able to fight,
however, so use caution.@0003
[41]

[42]
These are commands that you
can give to your units.@0003
Right now, you can see the
Item and Wait commands.@0003
You can issue a command
with the A Button.@0003
The Item command allows you to
equip, use, or discard items.@0003
If you're finished with a unit,
select Wait to end its turn.@0003
Remember that you can cancel
with the B Button,@0003
but if you select Wait you can't
take it back,@0003
so make sure you're finished
before selecting it.@0003
[43]

[44]
@000C@0010@0134
I'll tell you about the map menu now.@0003
Move the cursor to an empty space
and press the A Button.@0003
You can see more information about
each command by using the R Button.@0003
[45]
If you press the A Button when the
cursor is on an unoccupied space,@0003
the map menu appears.@0003
First, look at the bottom command.@0003
You can choose End to end your turn
before moving all of your units.@0003
Just select it and press the A Button
if you're ready.@0003
If you want to return to the map and
the cursor, press the B Button.@0003
[46]
@0010@0134Roy...! Nooo!@0003
...That's what I would be saying
if this was a real battle.@0003
This battle is lost.@0003
Don't be discouraged...
We'll try again tomorrow.@0003
Let's get some rest.@0003
[47]
@0010@0122
Roy... If this was a real
battle, I'd be dead.@0003
Remember that defeated
allies are gone forever.@0003
Be more careful in real
battles, OK...?@0003
[48]
@0010@010B
L-Lord Roy...@0003
This is only a training
session, so I'm fine,@0003
but if this were a real
battle, I would be dead.@0003
When defeated, allies are
gone forever.@0003
[49]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015C
Thank you for coming.@0003
Please remember to inform the
villagers in real battles as well.@0003
[4A]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0134
Good job! You've captured
the enemy's castle gate.@0003
That finishes our training
session for today.@0003
How do you feel?
Do you think you can do it?@0003
If you ever find yourself in
a real battle,@0003
just remember what you learned
here today and you'll be fine.@0003
[4B]
@0010@0109Ah, you've made it.@0003
This is a training session,
but a battle all the same.@0003
Don't expect me to go
easy on you!@0003
[4C]
@0010@0109Well... You win.
Nicely done.@0003
[4D]
@000C@0010@012E@0009@0010@0138@000C@0017All I want to know is what
happened to Princess Guinivere!@0003
@0009Y-yes, Captain Melady...@0003
I'm certain she was in her room this
morning, but she simply vanished...@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0013You told me that already, you buffoon!@0003
I don't want excuses! Are you so
incompetent you can't understand that?!@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0012Well... I... Er...@0003
@000B@0013Our forces are mobilizing to
begin a full-scale war with Lycia.@0003
How are we to focus on the battle
if the princess is missing?!@0003
Naturally, you will take full
responsibility for her disappearance.@0003
@0008@0012@0016......@0003
@000B@0014@0016I never should have let Her Highness
come to the border to begin with.@0003
I will return to Bern and inform
the king of this matter.@0003
I'll try not to cause a panic, but I can't
promise your life if the princess isn't found.@0003
I trust you'll take every measure to
locate her as soon as possible.@0003
@0008@0012Yes, Captain!@0003
[4E]
@000C@0010@0138@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0013@0017Is Princess Guinivere
secure?@0003
@0009@0012Yes, Commander. She's under constant
surveillance in the cellar.@0003
@000C@0014Good.
Don't let her escape.@0003
@0009But Commander...@0003
Are you sure this
is a good idea?@0003
@000C@0014@0017Of course I'm sure!@0003
The younger sister of King Zephiel...@0003
We're sure to get a hefty sum turning
her over to one of Bern's enemies.@0003
@0009@0017@0016......@0003@0016
@000CLoyalty to one's king.
Bah. What a worthless notion.@0003
The world is ruled by neither king
nor queen. It's ruled by gold!@0003
@0009Yes, indubitably, Commander.@0003
...But there has been a
snag, shall we say.@0003
@000CHm?
What do you mean?@0003
@0009I just received a report...@0003
It seems that Princess Guinivere's
lady-in-waiting has escaped...@0003
@000CWhat?! You lout, why didn't
you say so earlier?@0003@0002
Find her this instant!
Don't let her get away!@0003
[4F]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017Lord Roy,
this is the location.@0003
@000CThis is where we're supposed
to meet the mercenaries?@0003
@0009@0013Yes, though it seems
they aren't here yet.@0003
@0002Wait, who's that? Somebody's
coming this way...@0003
[50]
@000C@0010@010F@0009@0010@0102@0017
Be careful there!@0003
@000COh, forgive me!
I'm in such a hurry...@0003
@0009@0017No need for apologies.@0003
Are you hurt?@0003
@000C@0017No, I'm fine.
Thank you, good sir.@0003
@0009@0017Farewell, then.@0003
@000C@0017...Are you from Lycia,
by chance?@0003
@0009@0017I am.@0003
I am the son of
Marquess Pherae.@0003
@000COh, Saint Elimine! Thank you
for guiding me to this boy!@0003
@0009@0017Pardon?@0003@0080@0004
@000C@0080@000DPlease, I need your help
to rescue my mistress.@0003
@0009What happened?@0003
@000BMy name is Elen. I am a
cleric of Saint Elimine.@0003
My mistress and I came from Bern to seek
an audience with the lords of Lycia.@0003
However, Commander Ruud of the
castle east of here trapped us.@0003
We were captured, imprisoned
by our own countrymen.@0003
@000D@0010@0154
Lord Roy!@0003
We must avoid unnecessary
entanglements with Bern!@0003
@0009But we can't neglect a noble of Bern who
wants to speak with the lords of Lycia.@0003
...Then again, we can't simply charge
into enemy territory either...@0003@0002
Wait, who's there?!@0003
[51]
@0009@0010@01D7
@0017There she is!@0003
Over here, boys!
Get the girl!@0003
@0009Our orders say
dead or alive!@0003
[52]
@000C@0010@010F@0017Oh dear...@0003@0011
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
Well, Merlinus, they provoked hostilities.
I don't think we have any choice now.@0003
@0009You wouldn't listen even
if we did, I'm sure.@0003
But no matter. Let me witness all you've
learned about tactics in Ostia.@0003
@000CAll right, everyone!
We're going to charge the castle!@0003
Sister Elen, you should
find a place to hide...@0003
@0009@0011@0009@0010@010FNo, I will
come with you.@0003
I cannot fight, but I can
heal wounded allies.@0003
@000C@0012But...@0003
@0009@0014I'm the one that got you
tangled up in this mess.@0003
Please let me do what I can to help.@0003
@000COK, but just stay behind
us so you aren't hurt.@0003
@0009Certainly. Thank you
for the concern.@0003
[53]
@000C@0010@0115@0017They should be around
here somewhere...@0003
@0017Shanna, @0009@0010@0129@000Ccheck around and try to
find the soldiers from Pherae, will you?@0003
@0009@0012Sure!@0003
[54]
@0009@0010@011E@000C@0010@0115@0009@0014So Big Man, who's our
client this time?@0003
@000C@0013House Pherae, one of the
noble families of Lycia.@0003
The marquess's son is going to join the
other armies of the Lycian League.@0003
@0009@0011@0009@0010@011F@0017We're going up
against Bern then?@0003
@000C@0012@0017Looks that way.@0003
@0009@0011@0009@0010@011E@0013Finally, a foe worthy of my axe!
Let's show 'em what we're made of!@0003
@0009@0011@0009@0010@011F@0017Bern, eh? This won't be easy, I can
tell you that. We had best tread lightly.@0003
[55]
@0009@0010@0129@000C@0010@0115@0009@0014I think I've found them!@0003
@0017But it looks like they're already
caught up in a skirmish.@0003
@000C@0013What? The fighting's
started already?@0003
Let's get a move on then.
Time to earn our pay!@0003
[56]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@0102@0009@0013Are you Lord Roy of
House Pherae?@0003
@000C@0012@0017Who is it that's asking?@0003
@0009@0013@0017Name's Dieck.@0003
You should've heard about me from
an older man named Merlinus.@0003
@000CSo you're the leader of
the mercenary band?@0003
@0009@0013Just a small company, really.@0003
Sorry we're late.@0003
Didn't think the fighting
would start so soon.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Well... There was
a complication...@0003
@0009@0014@0017Don't take it the wrong way.
We don't blame you.@0003
Actually, quite the contrary.@0003
My boys are excited for a chance
to show off their skills.@0003
@000C@0013Brilliant. It sounds like you're just
the caliber of fighters we need.@0003
@0009@0012Enough chitchat then.@0003
Let's wrap things up.@0003
[57]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015FFlying units may be weak against bows, but
you can use that against your enemies too.@0003
If a pegasus or wyvern comes close, you
can tear 'em apart with arrows!@0003
[58]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0160Armored knights have nearly
impenetrable defenses.@0003
But some weapons, like this sword,
can pierce their armor.@0003
I'm sure you can get better use out
of it than us. Please, take it.@0003
[59]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0165Pegasi are useful for flying to
hard-to-reach places.@0003
But woe to any rider who finds
herself against an archer.@0003
An arrow can make short work
of a pegasus!@0003
[5A]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0161The weapon triangle...
Swords, axes, and lances.@0003
Remember, swords best axes, axes best
lances, and lances best swords.@0003
Keep this in mind and things
will be much easier for you.@0003
[5B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015EForts are the key to a good defense.@0003
If you're in a fort, you can defend
and even dodge more easily.@0003
On top of that, your wounds
will heal slowly over time.@0003
[5C]
@0010@0138@0017Curse it all!@0003
Just when I thought things had
finally turned my way...@0003
[5D]
@0010@0138@0017Oof...@0003
Greed can only...bring
you...an ill fate...@0003
[5E]
@0009@0010@0154@000B@0010@0102
@0009@0017Lord Roy!@0003
There was a woman locked
in the cellar!@0003
@000BThat must be Elen's mistress.
Bring her here.@0003
@0009Yes, milord.@0017@0003@0009@0011@0009@0010@0157
[5F]
@000D@0010@010FYour Highness!@0003
@0009Elen!
I'm so relieved you're well.@0003
@0017You put yourself in such danger
running off like you did...@0003
I worried myself sick about you.@0003
@000DI am sorry, Your Highness, but I couldn't
leave you in that dank cellar...@0003
@0009@0017Don't worry yourself, Elen.
It's thanks to you I am safe now.@0003@000D@0011
[60]
@0009I am in your debt.
May I ask your name...?@0003
@000BI am Roy, son of Eliwood,
Marquess Pherae.@0003
@0009It's a pleasure...
As for myself...@0003
[61]
@000D@0010@010F@0017Your Highness... Are you
certain you should?@0003
@0009@0017Yes, Elen. It is fine.@0003@000D@0011
[62]
@0009@0017My name is
Guinivere.@0003
@000BGuinivere?!@0003
That's the name of the
princess of Bern!@0003
@0009Yes, that is I.@0003
@000D@0010@0154What?!@0003
This was a trap,
wasn't it?!@0003
@000BMerlinus, hold.@0003@001C
@000DI beg your pardon,
Lord Roy, but...@0003
@001C
@000BI wish to hear her out.
Give her a chance, will you?@0003
@001C
@000DTsk. As you will...@0003
@000D@0011@001C
@000BYou are truly Princess
Guinivere from Bern?@0003
@0009Yes, truly. I cannot blame you
for doubting me, however.@0003
@000BMaybe you are the princess of Bern,
and maybe you aren't.@0003
I can see from your actions and dress
that you are at least of high status.@0003
If you are indeed Princess Guinivere, however,
there's one thing I don't understand.@0003
Elen told me you intended to meet
the lords of the Lycian League.@0003
@0009Yes, that is correct.@0003
@000BWhy, if you are the sister
of the king of Bern?@0003
@0009I want to find a peaceful
way to end the war.@0003
If I can speak to the Lycian council, I'm
certain we can come to a solution.@0003
@000BYour brother instigated this war.
Is it in your power to stop it?@0003
@0009At the very least, I wish to do everything
I can. No, I MUST do everything I can.@0003
@000B@0017...I see.@0003
For the time being, come with us to
meet the Lycian League armies.@0003
I want to see what Lord Hector
thinks of this affair.@0003
@0009@0017You will allow me
to accompany you?@0003
@000B@0017Yes. If there is any possibility to
avoid further bloodshed, we must try.@0003
It matters not how small the chance.@0003
@0009Thank you!@0003
I truly am in your debt...@0003
[63]
@0009@0010@0148@000C@0010@0149@0013@0009@0017Your Majesty, we have
captured the enemy commander.@0003
@000C@0012Good.
Bring him before me.@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@01BF
@0008@0013You...@0003
You're Zephiel, the king of Bern!!@0003
Black-hearted fiend...!@0003
@000C@0014Ah, Lord Hector.@0003
You have my highest praise for lasting so
long against two of my Wyvern Generals.@0003
I suppose Ostia's reputation as the most
powerful house in Lycia is well-earned.@0003
The strongest of a bucket of worms is
hardly a match for my boot, however.@0003
Your end is nigh. If you've any last
words, I suggest you spit them out.@0003
@0008@0012Just tell me...
Why...?@0003
@000CWhat was that?@0003
@0008@0014Bern and Lycia...@0003
We were always on good terms with
each other...@0003
Even when you took the throne, we
always paid our respects to Bern...@0003
@000C@0013@0017Respect?@0003
@0017Pah. Don't make me laugh.@0003
The whole continent shall be my domain.
Only then can the world be liberated.@0003
I lack the time to concern myself with
such trivial matters as "respect."@0003
@0008You mean to liberate...the world?@0003
What do you speak of...?@0003
@000CPay it no heed. You won't
live to see it anyway.@0003
You there!@0003
Take him away!@0003
@0008@0011@0009@0010@01D7
@000C@0014Throw this dead man
into the dungeon!@0003
@0009@0014Yes, Your Majesty!@0003@0011@0005
@0009@0010@0148@0014Your Majesty, I will take my leave now.
I must return to the plains of Sacae.@0003
@000C@0014Yes, be on your way.@0003
@0009@0014...One matter before I leave, Your Majesty.@0003
If you will allow my opinion, I would not
place so much trust in that...woman.@0003
@000C@0014Do you speak of Idunn?@0003
@0009@0014Yes, Your Majesty.@0003
The men call her the "Dark Priestess"
and find her presence disturbing.@0003
I understand that she is a shaman
of great power, but--@0003
@000C@0014Brunnya,
do you doubt my judgment?@0003
@0009@0014Ah...! No, of course
not, Your Majesty!@0003
I just think--@0003
@000C@0014Your duty is not to think.@0003
Your duty is to follow orders.@0003
Is that clear?@0003
@0009@0014...Yes, Your Majesty.
Your will shall be done.@0003
@0009@0011@000C
"Do you doubt my judgment?"@0003
Dear me, the words that come
out of my mouth sometimes...@0003
[64]
@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@0102@0017Lord Hector
still lives?!@0003
@0009Yeah, probably.@0003
I saw some of Bern's soldiers
take him into the castle.@0003
@000CChad, was it? Do you know the
inside of Castle Araphen well?@0003
@0009I guess so.@0003
...Wait, are you guys going to
try to save Lord Hector?@0003
Sounds like a bad idea to me.@0003
Most of Bern's forces are gone, but there
are still plenty of soldiers in the castle.@0003
Marching in would be suicide.@0003
@000CPerhaps.@0003
But you said most of their
army is already gone.@0003
We can't afford to lose
Lord Hector.@0003
If we have a chance, we
must take it.@0003
@0009Really, now...?@0003
@0017I'll come with you then.@0003
I can show you around
the castle.@0003
@000C@0017What?
You don't have to do that.@0003
Please, just explain what the
interior of the castle is like.@0003
@0009I've got a bone to pick with Bern.
Please, let me go with you!@0003
@000C@0013If you insist, we're happy to
have you.@0003
I think your skills will be an asset.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah, I can pick any
locked doors or chests!@0003@0080@0004
@0009@0011@0009@0010@0157@0013@0017...Lord Roy...@0003
I'm sorry for my brother...@0003
I didn't think the invasion
would pick up so quickly...@0003
@000C@0014Princess, you're not
responsible for this.@0003
Please don't blame yourself.
Besides, Lycia is still united.@0003
We just need Lord Hector to lead
our army so we can fight!@0003@0002
We must retake Castle Araphen for all
of Lycia...and for Lilina...@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CLet's move out!@0003
[65]
@000C@0010@0121@0009@0010@01C1@000C@0013Thanks for taking the children
under your care, Bishop.@0003
@0009@0014Of course.@0003
The St. Elimine Church will take
good care of the orphans.@0003
And what will you do, Lugh?@0003
@000CI'm going to stay here.
I have some things to take care of.@0003
@0009@0013Is that so...?
Please be safe.@0003
@000CYes, you too.@0003
@0009@0011@000A@0010@0167@0008@0010@0166@000CMake sure you listen to what
the priest says, OK?@0003
@0008@0017You're not coming
with us, Lugh?@0003
@000C@0014@0017I'm going to wait for Chad.
We'll catch up with you later...@0003
@000A@0013Yay!
Chad's coming too?@0003
@000C@0012Of course.@0003
@0008@0014I want Raigh
back too!@0003
@000C@0012Yes...@0003
If Raigh would come back we could
all be together again.@0003
@0011
@000B@0010@01C1@0014Children,
we must be off.@0003@0011
@000C@0010@0121
@0008See you,
Lugh.@0003
@000ADon't take too long.@0003
@000C@0013Yes, yes. Hurry along now...@0003@0002
@0008@0011@000A@0011@0005@000C@0017I'm sorry for lying...@0003
But I've chosen not to run away anymore.@0003
[66]
@000C@0010@0149@0013@0017Narcian!@0003
@0009@0010@0142@000CWhat is causing all that noise?@0003
@0009@0014@0017What's left of the enemy are likely
putting up one last fight.@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@014B@0012@0017Shall I summon the dragons,
Your Majesty?@0003
@000C@0011@000B@0010@0142@0014@0017No need, my lady. We can handle them
without so much as breaking a sweat.@0003@0008@0012@0017@0016......@0003
@000B@0011@000C@0010@0149@0014@0016Not now, Idunn.@0003
Send the dragons back to
Bern as planned.@0003
@0008Yes, Your Majesty.
As you will.@0003
@000C@0011@000B@0010@0142@0012@0016......@0003
@0008@0011@000B@0011
@0009@0010@0142@000C@0010@0149@0014@0016I too must return 
to Bern.@0003
Narcian, I leave Lycia in
your hands.@0003
@0009@0013...What shall I do with the remnants
of the Lycian Army?@0003
@000CKill all who stand
against you.@0003
@0009@0017...What of women
and children?@0003
@000C@0017Was I unclear? Kill all who
stand against you.@0003
Grind them to dust.@0003
Ensure no others dare dream
of opposing us.@0003
@0009@0012@0017Of course, Your Majesty.@0003
@0016Hm@0005 hm@0005 hm...@0003
[67]
@000C@0010@0142@0009@0010@0139@000C@0017Hmph, what does His Majesty
see in that Idunn anyway?@0003
Well, I think it's time I
left as well.@0003
Slater, I entrust the
castle to you.@0003
@0009@0013Might I inquire where
you're going, milord?@0003
@000CA marquess who turned against Lycia
has a special gift for me.@0003
He says it's a girl of Etrurian
nobility...@0003
@0016Hm@0005 hm@0005 hm...@0016@0003
@0009Etrurian nobility?
She must be quite a catch!@0003
@000C@0013Yes, the marquess tells me she's
a beautiful thing.@0003
@0009You must be looking forward
to it.@0003
Please be careful on your
way there.@0003
@000C@0014You be careful too, Slater. Don't let
these scattered remnants defeat you.@0003
Should you fail, I personally will
order your public evisceration.@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0012@0016......@0016@0003
Have mercy...!@0003
@000C@0017Ha ha ha ha...!@0003
[68]
@000C@0010@0121@0009@0010@0111@000C@0013Chad!
You're OK!@0003
@0009@0017Lugh?!
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0012@0017We were hiding here.@0003
@0009@0014@0017Oh...@0003
Where's everybody else?
Are they all right?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, the St. Elimine Church
is going to watch over them.@0003
@0009@0012@0017And what about you?@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009@0013Why are you
still here?@0003
@000C...The same reason as you.@0003
@0009What?!
Lugh, you're not thinking of...!@0003
@000C@0014I can use some magic!@0003
Remember I borrowed that fire
tome from Poppa's room?@0003
@0009Lugh, you can't. You're
incapable of harming others.@0003
@000C@0012But...@0003
@0009@0014I'm going to avenge Poppa.
You stay with the others, Lugh.@0003
@000CI'm not going to hide anymore!@0003
I'm tired of everyone
leaving me...!@0003
Poppa, you, and even Raigh...@0003
I want to fight to protect the people
that I care for.@0003
I can't let others die for me my
whole life!@0003
@0009Lugh...@0003@0002
Fine. Once we finish Bern we can
go back and see everyone again!@0003
@000C@0012Yeah!@0003
[69]
@000C@0010@0121@0009@0010@0111@000C@0013Chad!
You're OK!@0003
@0009@0017Lugh?!
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0012@0017We were hiding here.@0003
@0009@0014@0017Oh...@0003
Where's everybody else?
Are they all right?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, the St. Elimine Church
is going to watch over them.@0003
@0009@0012@0017And what about you?@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009@0013Why are you
still here?@0003
@000C...The same reason as you.@0003
@0009What?!
Lugh, you're not thinking of...!@0003
@000C@0014I can use some magic!@0003
Remember I borrowed that fire
tome from Poppa's room?@0003
@0009Lugh, you can't. You're
incapable of harming others.@0003
@000C@0012But...@0003
@0009@0014I'm going to avenge Poppa.
You stay with the others, Lugh.@0003
@000CI'm not going to hide anymore!@0003
I'm tired of everyone

Poppa, you, and even Raigh...@0003
I want to fight to protect the people
that I care for.@0003
I can't let others die for me my
whole life!@0003
@0009Lugh...@0003@0002
Fine. Once we finish Bern we can
go back and see everyone again!@0003
@000C@0012Yeah!@0003
[6A]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0121@0014@0017Excuse me!
You're with the Lycian Army, right?@0003
Please, let me fight with you!@0003
I don't have any useful information,
but I can use a bit of magic!@0003
I'm sure I can help you!@0003
[6B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015F@000C@0017You're what's left of the
Lycian Army, aren't you?@0003
Here, take this and go quickly.@0003
We may be occupied by Bern, but
we're still Lycians!@0003
[6C]
@0010@0139@0017I-I can't fail!
If I do...@0003
...What awaits me...is a
fate worse than death...!!@0003
[6D]
@0010@0139@0017General Narcian...
Please...have mercy...!!@0003 
[6E]
@0009@0010@0154@0013@0017Lord Roy!@0003
We found Lord Hector
in the dungeon!@0003
@000C@0010@0102@0012You did?!
Is he all right?@0003
@0009@0013He's gravely wounded...@0003@0011
@0008@0010@01BF@0012Well met, Roy...@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0013Lord Hector!@0003
That gaping wound...!@0003
We must get you help!
Here, lean on my shoulder...@0003
@0008Don't worry yourself...
I'm done for...@0003
@000B@0012Lord Hector...@0003
@0008@0013We were taken by surprise...@0003
We'd have never supposed that Bern
had summoned dragons...!@0003
@000B@0012Dragons?!@0003
@0008@0014Yes...@0003
The same dragons that humans fought
against in the Scouring...@0003
@000B@0013The Scouring?
I learned of that in my studies.@0003
Eons ago, dragon and human each had
dominion of half of Elibe.@0003
The Scouring was a war for total
control of the continent...@0003@001C
@0008Very good, lad...@0003
The Eight Legends...defeated the dragons
and led the humans to...victory...@0003@001C
@000BHow did Bern summon dragons...?@0003@0008@0014I...haven't the faintest...@0003
But...Bern was once the
dragons' domain...@0003
Hartmut, one of the Eight Legends...
was the founder of Bern...@0003
Perhaps...the reason...lies
there...@0003
@000B@0012Lord Hector!@0003
@0008@0014Roy... Go to Ostia...@0003
You must...lead what remains of
the Lycian Army...in my place...@0003
@000BMe...? But...@0003
@0008Fear not...in Ostia...is a weapon...
that...can take down a dragon...@0003
@000BA weapon?@0003
@0008@0014Lilina can tell you more...
Please take care of her...@0003
She...may act strong...
But she is still a child...@0003
Please...don't let...her...d...@0003@001C
@000B...I promise you,
I won't.@0003
@0008@0014...Lilina... Let me...see you...
just...once more...@0003@0002
Hrk...!!@0003@0002@0016
......@0003@0016
@0011
@000BLord Hector!@0003
[6F]
@0009@0010@013A@000C@0010@0142@0009Ah, welcome,
General Narcian.@0003
@000CLord Erik.@0003
I don't think I've yet praised your
wisdom in joining Bern.@0003
@0009Thank you. My nation has never been
anything but a burden to me anyway.@0003
@000CYou, my friend, are wise
beyond your years.@0003
Now, where is that gift
you promised me?@0003
She does not seem to be here.@0003
@0009Ah, yes!
She is in her quarters.@0003
@0009She is exceedingly naive, you see.@0003
When I told her she could meet her brother,
she cooperated without question.@0003
@0017You there!
Bring her here!@0003
@0009@0011@0005@0008@0010@0103What is this hall?
Klein? Where are you, Brother?@0003
@000C@0017Welcome, Lady Clarine.@0003
@0008@0017Who might you be?@0003
@000C@0017I am Narcian, one of Bern's
three Wyvern Generals.@0003
My lovely little lass, I think you will enjoy
my company more than your brother's...@0003
@0080@000D@0016Hm@0005 hm@0005 hm...@0016@0003
@0008@0012Heh...
Ha ha ha!@0003
@000B@0013@0017What?@0003
Why do you laugh?@0003
@0008@0014@0017You compare yourself to my brother?@0003
You think too highly of yourself.@0003
Your garb, your hair--even your speech...@0003
All a painfully obvious guise to hide
your true lowborn face.@0003
@000B@0080@000E@0013@0017Lowborn?! Me?!
You would compare ME to a peasant?!@0003
@0008@0014Oh, heavens no.@0003
I would sooner compare you to a
filthy, disease-ridden mutt!@0003
@000C@0080@000DY-you vermin!!@0003
I'll see you
suffer!@0003
@0008@0011@000A@0010@01D7General Narcian, we just received word that
Castle Araphen was retaken by the enemy!@0003
@000BWhat?! Impossible!
What of Slater?@0003
@000AErr...
His whereabouts are unknown, sir.@0003
The enemy is reported to be Roy,
son of Marquess Pherae.@0003@0011
@0008@0010@0103@0012@0016......@0003
@000B@0016@0014Accursed interruptions!@0003
Lord Erik, lock the girl in a cell.@0003
I will give her the pleasure of
my company when I return!@0003
You, blockade the highroad
from Ostia.@0003
This Roy might just pass by.
I want his head!@0003
@000A@0010@01D7Yes, sir!@0003
[70]
@000C@0010@0151@0012Heh... Foolish nobility. Always
involved in some petty dispute.@0003
'Course, you'll hear no complaints from us.
Turmoil's how we make a living.@0003
Heh heh heh...@0003
[71]
@000C@0010@0103@0013@0017They will pay dearly
for this treatment...@0003
@0009@0012...Hey.@0003
@000CWho's there?!@0003
@0009@0010@0114@0014I'm a mercenary hired by Lord Erik.@0003
He wants to see you.@0003
@000C@0080@000FI will not.@0003
I refuse to meet with
such churlish people.@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0012@0016......@0016@0003
Just get over here.@0003
@000D@0013Let go! You will regret this!
Have you any idea who I am?!@0003
@000A@0012@0016......@0003
@000D@0013@0016Let go, I say!@0003
[72]
@000C@0010@0103@0009@0010@0114@000C@0012@0017Let go!
Let go, I say!@0003
@0009@0013Keep it down.@0003
You won't be able to make a clean
escape making all that noise.@0003
@000C@0012Escape?!@0005
Then you're...@0003
@0009@0013I prepared a horse for you
out back under a tree.@0003
Take it and go, while
everyone's distracted.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
Why are you helping me?@0003
@0009@0012I despise Bern with
all my soul.@0003
@000CWith all your soul?@0003
@0009...Never mind.
Forget it.@0003
@000C@0013
Saying that only piques
my curiosity further.@0003
@0009@0012Time is short.
Hurry!@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
[73]
@0010@0114@0012@0016......@0003
[74]
@000C@0010@0103@0017I've never met such a boorish man!
This is a battlefield!@0003
A proper gentleman would escort
a lady to her mansion!@0003
Well, it's hardly of concern now.@0003
Sigh, I only came here to see my brother,
and now look at the mess I'm in...@0003
What am I to do now?@0003
[75]
@0009@0010@013A@000C@0010@0114@0009@0017Ah,
there you are!@0003
@000CWhat do you want?@0003
@0009We need some backup.@0003
Take some troops and
prepare for battle.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Are you deaf?
Go and fight!@0003
@000CI heard you.
I'll leave when I'm ready.@0003@0011
@0009Tsk. Not the amiable sort, is he?@0003
If his sword arm is as skilled as the rumors
say, though, then it's no matter.@0003
[76]
@0009@0010@0103@0012@0017Pardon me,
you there!@0003
@000C@0010@0102Me?@0003
@0009@0013Do you see anyone else?@0003
You are the leader of this
little group, are you not?@0003
@000C@0012I am.@0003
@0009@0013Most convenient.@0003
Very well then. You
will protect me.@0003
@000C@0012Excuse me?@0003
@0009@0014Hard of hearing?@0003
I said that you will
protect me from harm.@0003
@000C@0011@000D@0010@0154Mind your mouth,
young lady!@0003
@0009@0013Away with you, peasant.
I was not addressing you.@0003
@000D@0080@000EWhat?!
Who do you think--@0003
@000C@0011@000B@0010@0102@0013Calm yourself, Merlinus...@0003
It looks like she's being pursued
by the castle's soldiers.@0003
That's why she wants us to
guard her.@0003
Right?@0003
@0009Um, yes!@0003
That is correct...@0003
@000B@0011@000C@0010@0154
Im...impudent child!@0003
We can't simply accept any
useless girl into our army!@0003
@0009@0080@000CYou may call me
Lady Clarine, peasant.@0003
And I am not useless!@0003
I can use staves to heal
wounded allies.@0003
@000C@0011@000B@0010@0102@0013So you'll help us fight?@0003
@000A@0014...If that's what it takes!@0003
I suppose I can't simply demand protection
without any kind of payment.@0003
@000B@0017Thanks, we appreciate it!@0003
Our enemy is Bern, so we need
everyone we can get.@0003
I'm Roy.
Pleased to meet you, Lady Clarine.@0003
@000A@0013The pleasure is all--@0003
@0080@000B@0017Ahem! Let's focus on
the issue at hand.@0003
[77]
@000C@0010@0103@0009@0010@0114@000C@0012@0017Oh!
It's you...@0003
@0009What?
You're still here?@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0014"Still here?"@0003
You abandoned me in the middle
of a battlefield!@0003
How can you have the
nerve to say that?!@0003
I could have been killed!@0003
@0009I guess you're lucky
you're still alive then.@0003
Did you want something or
can I go now?@0003
@000BJust a moment!@0003
I shan't allow you to abandon
me twice.@0003
A gentleman must take
responsibility for his actions.@0003
@0009@0012Responsibility? For what? I saved
you from that twisted sadist.@0003
@000B@0014If a gentleman rescues a lady, he must
also escort her to her mansion!@0003
In what fairy tale does some barf
of a man abandon his princess?@0003
@0009@0013...What in the world
are you on about?@0003
@000B@0014Besides, you said you "despise
Bern with all your soul."@0003
If you ask me, you'd be better off joining
us. We'll be fighting Bern, you know.@0003
@0009@0012What? Wait!
Is that true?@0003
Is that army you're in really
going to challenge Bern?@0003
@000B@0080@000EYes... Our leader, Floyd or whatever
his name is, told me so himself.@0003
@0009@0012@0016......@0016@0003
Fine.@0003
@000C@0012Yes?@0003
@0009@0013I'll join your army.
Satisfied?@0003
@000C@0012Ah...I suppose.@0003
@0009@0011@000CWait!@0003
My protection is more important
than fighting Bern! Come back!@0003
[78]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0166
Without a thief, you can't open
doors and chests so easily.@0003
Only thieves can use lockpicks.@0003
But I have something called a door
key, which will open any door.@0003
Anyone can use it.
You can have it.@0003
[79]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015D@0017We're all on your side.@0003
@000CWe're not about to abandon the
land in which we were born.@0003
@000CPlease take this sword.@0003
It was given to us generations ago.
A gift from the marquess.@0003
[7A]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015D
@000C@0017I can't believe this war is happening...@0003
We'll all suffer under Bern's
iron-fisted rule.@0003
But you just might be able
to stop them.@0003
Here is something that will help
you fight a little longer.@0003
Think carefully before using it.@0003
[7B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0162Bandits and pirates will
attack nearby towns.@0003
Once they loot a town,
there's nothing left.@0003
Visit the towns quickly and they
might just share something good!@0003
[7C]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0164There are mounted soldiers
with bows in Laus' army.@0003
They're from the nomad clans
of Sacae.@0003
Everyone wants their fighting
prowess these days...@0003
[7D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0161
@000C@0017You know the weapon triangle, but did you
know it doesn't apply to all weapons?@0003
Some weapons completely reverse
the weapon triangle.@0003
For instance, you might find an axe that
will work well against swords.@0003
[7E]
@0010@013A@0017You fools are bound down
by your allegiance!@0003
Allow me to teach you
the way of the world!@0003
[7F]
@0010@013A@0017Ha...ha ha... Fools...
There is no future for...@0003
those...who oppose...
absolute power...@0003
[80]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017Lord Roy! The remaining
soldiers from Laus are retreating.@0003
@000CThank you.
Tell everyone to get some rest.@0003
@0009Yes, milord.@0003
@0009@0011@0080@0004@0009@0005@0010@0157Roy...
Are you all right?@0003
@000C
I never would have thought that
Lord Erik would turn on Lycia.@0003
I thought the Lycian League's
bond was stronger than this.@0003
Cowardly Bern!
Underhanded tactics!@0003
@0009...I apologize.@0003
@000COh... I'm sorry.@0003
I wasn't even thinking
about you...@0003
@0009No... You are right.@0003
@000CWe'll now proceed west towards Ostia.@0003
But now we know that even the other
marquesses can't be trusted.@0003
With Lord Hector gone, I fear there
may be no peaceful end for this war.@0003
Princess, do you plan on returning
to Bern? If you need anything--@0003
@0009No, please allow me to stay,
if it would not be a burden.@0003
@000CYou, a burden? Never!
But why do you wish to stay?@0003
@0009My brother is wrong.@0003
He is pulling the dragons
into a human war.@0003
If he thinks this is how he can
free the world, I must stop him.@0003
@000CFree the world?@0003
@0009Yes, he has always been obsessed
with "liberating the world."@0003
He said that's the purpose
of this war.@0003
@000CWhat does that mean?@0003
@0009I do not know...@0003
My brother is not so power-hungry that
he would attempt to conquer the world.@0003
I'm sure he believes strongly in
what he's done to Elibe.@0003
Regardless, that doesn't excuse
the violence he has caused...@0003
@000CPrincess Guinivere...@0003
[81]
@0009@0010@0150@000C@0010@013B@0009@0013@0017Boss!@0003
Our boys just got back from
scouting the village.@0003
@000C@0014Then let's go get
our tribute.@0003
@0009But Boss, something's
different today.@0003
There's an army stationed
real close to us!@0003
They say it looks like
the Lycian Army.@0003
@000CLycia? Then there's
nothing to worry about.@0003
They were almost wiped
out by Bern.@0003
We can handle a few
battered soldiers.@0003
@0009You're right, Boss!@0003
@000CThey've probably got some
valuables on them too!@0003
Still, don't get careless.@0003@0002
Ready then? Let's mop up
these losers, boys!@0003
[82]
@0008@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102@0008@0017A villager is here to see you,
Lord Roy.@0003
Hey, you, wait just a second...@0003@0006
@000A@0010@015D@0013Are you Lord Roy of
House Pherae?@0003
@000C@0012Yes.
How may I help you?@0003
@000A@0013Milord, I beg you!@0003
Please, rid us of the bandits
terrorizing our village!@0003
@000C@0012Bandits?@0003
@000A@0013There's a group of bandits that made their
base in the castle near the cliffs.@0003
@000CWhere are the castle guards?@0003
@000A@0014They fled once they heard that the
Lycian Army was defeated by Bern...@0003
We villagers were left on our own.@0003
Our days are spent in fear of
bandit attacks.@0003
@000C@0012@0016......@0016@0003
@000AWe have no one else we can ask.
Please, help us!@0003
@0008@001C@0012Lord Roy, we must keep
our pace towards Ostia...@0003@001C
@000CYes, I know.@0003
But we can't simply ignore
people in need of help!@0003
@0008You're joking!@0003
@000A@0017You will help us?!
Thank you!@0003
Please use the gate
to the west.@0003
It'll take you right
to the castle.@0003
@000C@0017Thank you.@0003
@000AI'll arrange for the gate to be
opened when you approach.@0003@0011
@000CMerlinus! We're going to the
castle to drive off the bandits!@0003@001C
@0008Sigh... Youthful energy.
Where does it come from?@0003
[83]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010C
@0009Thank you, Dorothy. Please tell
Brother Saul as well.@0003
@000CI will, Father Yoder.@0003@0009@0011@0002
@000C@0017But where did Saul run off to now?@0003
How am I supposed to guard him
if he keeps disappearing?@0003
@000C@0011@000A@0010@0160@000B@0010@010E@000A@0013Er... Brother Saul, I appreciate
the offer, but not tonight...@0003
@000B@0014@0017Come now, don't be like that.@0003
We can sit by the fire in the dark of night
as I soothe you with my calming sermons...@0003
@0008@0010@010C@0012@0017There you are!
Saul!@0003
@000BWonderful.
Dorothy...@0003
@000A@001CI'll take my leave now.@0003@0011@001C
@000BNo, don't go!@0003@0002
@000B@0014@0017Oh my... Look what you've
done now, Dorothy.@0003
@000B@0014That expression on your face
scared her away.@0003
@0008@0080@000B@0017This is my normal look!@0003
Saul, you can't try to woo
every girl you meet.@0003
@000B@0013@0017You make it sound like a bad thing!@0003
I simply offer my helping hand
to any poor souls in need.@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0017Then why do you always offer
to give your sermons at night?@0003
@000B@0080@000E@0014@0017...Well, putting that aside...@0003
Did you have some reason for
interrupting my good work?@0003
@000A@0017Oh, right.@0003
The Lycian Army is apparently
somewhere around here.@0003
@000CTruly?! Is Princess Guinivere
still with them?@0003
@000AYes, if the reports from the
St. Elimine Church are accurate.@0003
@000CThen we must make haste!
Let us join them.@0003
@000A@0012@0016......@0003
@000C@0016What's the matter,
Dorothy?@0003
@000A@0014You only want to join them because Princess
Guinivere is said to be so beautiful.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Don't be ridiculous...
Come now, hurry along.@0003
@000A@0012Yes, let's go!@0003
[84]
@000C@0010@0164Oh, I heard you were coming.
I'll open the gate now.@0003
[85]
@000C@0010@013B@0017What?
There was a gate there?@0003
Cunning little
weaklings...@0003
[86]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0162
@000CHold on. Before you go,
take this lance with you.@0003
It was once wielded by a
knight called Sir Gant.@0003
The stories say he bested many
a foe with this lance!@0003
[87]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0163
If you can, try to occupy forts!@0003
That'll stop enemy reinforcements
from showing up!@0003
[88]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0165
@000CI was there when
Araphen was taken...@0003
The wyvern riders of Bern were
terrifying enough...@0003
But then a dragon engulfed the
Lycian Army in flame...@0003
Oh Elimine, please tell me
it was a dream...@0003
[89]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0160
@000C@0017This whole area is really perfect for
bandits. It's no wonder they appeared.@0003
They can cross mountains and a bandit on
a peak is a force to be reckoned with.@0003
Dreadful. Just dreadful...@0003
[8A]
@0010@013BNo one's ever survived
a blow from my axe!@0003
Hey, you. Wanna see why?@0003
[8B]
@0010@013B@0017Gah...!@0003
No...I don't wanna...
die...@0003
[8C]
@0009@0010@0154@000D@0010@0157@000B@0010@0102@0009@0017Lord Roy!@0003
A priest from the St. Elimine Church
wants an audience with you...@0003
and Princess Guinivere!@0003
@000B@0012He knew that Princess Guinivere
was with us?@0003
@0009@0013Yes. I can't imagine how.@0003
@000BMe neither...@0003
I'll see him alone.@0003
@000D@0013Roy, I will be fine.
I wish to meet this priest.@0003@001C
@000BPrincess?@0003@001C
@000DTensions between my brother and the
church have worsened as of late.@0003
I do not believe that they would
attempt anything underhanded.@0003@001C
@000BI see. Merlinus, allow
this priest in.@0003@001C
@0009@0011@0009@0010@010E@0014@0017Lord Roy, it is a pleasure to meet
you at last.@0003
I am Saul, an acolyte of the
St. Elimine Church.@0003
@000B@0017Pleased to meet you.@0003
@0009Oh...@0003
@0017And you must be Princess Guinivere!@0003
You are as beautiful as
the rumors say!@0003@001C
@000D@0012Pardon me...?@0003@001C
@0009Ahem... Forgive me.@0003@0080@0004
Your Highness, I wish to know the
location of the Fire Emblem.@0003
You have it with you,
do you not?@0003
@000D@0013
@0017How did you know that?!@0003
@0009@0014@0017Bern's head church tells us the Fire Emblem
disappeared from the Shrine of Seals.@0003
And you also went missing at exactly the
same time.@0003
@000D@0012@0016......@0003
@0009@0014@0016I was sent by the church to
confirm the truth.@0003
@0017Why did you take the Fire Emblem?@0003
@000D@0013...I wished to stop my brother.@0003
@0009Your brother...
Zephiel, the king of Bern.@0003
@000D@0014Yes.@0003
@0009Do you know what the
Fire Emblem is used for?@0003
@000D@0014...It's the key that awakens a sword that
was used to slay the dragons long ago.@0003
That was what my father told me anyway.@0003
I am unsure how exactly the Fire
Emblem or the sword work.@0003
My brother seemed to worry about the
Fire Emblem falling into enemy hands.@0003
...Extraordinarily so.@0003
@0009So you took the Fire Emblem to make the king
believe it fell into enemy hands?@0003
All in an attempt to stop his conquest?@0003
@000DYes...but the war continued anyway.@0003
@0009And what will you do now?@0003
@000D@0013...Must I reveal my plan
at this moment?@0003
@0009@0013Ah, so Your Highness has a plan.@0003
@000D@0012Yes. I have not given up hope of settling
this war without further bloodshed.@0003
@0009@0014@0017I see.@0003
In that case, I will accompany
you on your journey.@0003
@000D@0012If Roy allows it.@0003
@000BI have no objections.@0003
@000D@0011@0009@0011@0009@0010@0157Thank you, Roy.@0003
@000BOf course, Princess.@0003
[8D]
@000C@0010@012C@0017I snuck in here no problem, but
there's nothing worth stealing!@0003
Hmm, looks like the north hall has all
the valuables, but with that security--@0003@0002
...Are those footsteps?@0003@0011@0080@0004@0006
@000C@0010@01E3@0009@0010@01D7
@000C@0013I trust everything is under control.@0003
@0009Yes, Sir Wagner, the soldiers are
stationed all around the castle.@0003
@000C@0014Once they're inside and have their guard
down, ambush them, just as with Lord Orun.@0003
@0009Yes, sir.@0003
@000CI want Princess Guinivere alive.@0003
The rest you can do with
as you wish.@0003
Now go.@0003
@0009@0011@0005
@000C@0012Ha ha ha ha...@0003
@0014@0017First the Silver Wolf's granddaughter,
and now Princess Guinivere...@0003
With so much to offer, Bern is certain
to allow us to join them.@0003
@000C@0011@0006
@000F@0010@012C@0080@000EHmmm...@0005
Now isn't that interesting.@0003
[8E]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009Finally we can get a good
night's rest, Lord Roy!@0003
@000C@0017I wonder.@0003
That man said he was
Lord Orun's advisor...@0003
@0009Wagner? Did something
seem wrong with him?@0003
@000CHe seemed to be in control of
everything, as if he were the lord.@0003
And Lord Orun is so ill he can't
even meet his guests?@0003
It all seems strange...@0003
@0009Now that you mention it,
you have a point.@0003@0011
@000A@0010@010E@0014Excuse me, Lord Roy.@0003
There seem to be an awful lot of
soldiers patrolling the castle.@0003
@0008@0010@010CI think they're spying on us.@0003@001C
@000C@0012What?
No...@0003@001C
@000E@0010@012C@0014You noticed?
Not bad.@0003
@0008@0011@000A@0011@000C@0080@000D@0012Who's there?!
Show yourself, intruder!@0003
@000E@0080@000B@0017Hi!@0003
@000B@0013@0017And...who might you be?@0003
@0009@0014Aw, I'm not one to talk about myself.@0003
I overheard that Wagner guy
in the main hall though.@0003
He said they're gonna ambush
you guys.@0003
@000B@0012Lord Orun would never do that!@0003
@0009Oh yeah, he's dead, I think.@0003
Wagner assassinated him
or something.@0003
@000BWhat?!@0003
@0009@0014@0017He wants to capture you all
and turn you over to Bern.@0003
@000D@0011@0010@0154@0017Wait, Lord Roy!@0003
We can't trust her word
so easily!@0003
@0009@0017It's up to you whether you
trust me or not.@0003
But don't say I didn't
warn ya!@0003@001C
@000D@0011@0010@0157@0012@0017Roy...
If what she says is true...@0003@001C
@000B@0014Let's spring his trap.
We'll pretend like we're leaving.@0003
If Wagner is after us, he'll try
to persuade us to stay.@0003
@0009@0017If you wanna get out,
go through the north hall!@0003
That'll bring you to the courtyard,
so you'll be outta here in no time.@0003
Good luck!@0003
[8F]
@0009@0010@01E3@000D@0010@0102
@0009@0017Oh, Lord Roy!
Where are you off to?@0003
I will escort you back into the
castle. Please follow me.@0003
@000DMy apologies, Sir Wagner.@0003
I have just received a report
of grave importance.@0003
Please excuse us, but we must
take our leave now.@0003
@0009Surely you would appreciate a warm bed
after being in the field for so long.@0003
Lord Orun would be furious with me if you
left without accepting our hospitality.@0003
@000DDon't worry, I shall tell Lord Orun
myself that you are not to blame.@0003
I ought to at least offer him
a greeting anyway.@0003
Please show us to his room.@0003
@0009As I said, milord, Lord Orun is
ill and cannot accept guests.@0003
@000DIf we cannot see him,
then we must be off.@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0012There's nothing I can offer
to make you stay?@0003
@000D@0016......@0003
@000A@0014@0016You leave me no choice then!@0003
Guards! Attack!@0003
Kill them all, but leave
Princess Guinivere alive!@0003@0011
@000DThe girl was right! They
were trying to ambush us!@0003
@0009@0010@010ELord Roy!@0003
If we go this way, we'll be leaving
our rear open to attack!@0003
@000DThen we'll seize the whole castle!
Everyone, follow my lead!@0003
[90]
@000C@0010@012C@0013Hoo-boy, they're at each
other's throats now.@0003
Time to pilfer what I can now
that security's busy.@0003
[91]
@000C@0010@0106@0013@0017All that noise...@0003
A battle?
What is going on out there?@0003
[92]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0102@0009@0012@0017Who are you?@0003
@000C@0013What's a girl doing in here?@0003
@0009You aren't with the castle?@0003
@000CMy name is Roy.
Who are you?@0003
@0009I am Sue. Are you the one
causing that noise outside?@0003
@000C@0012Noise?@0003
@0009The noise of a battle.@0003
@000C@0014Oh, I guess so.@0003
We're fighting the
castle guards.@0003
It's a bit of
a long story...@0003
@0009@0013I see.
Then I will join your side.@0003
@000C@0012You will?
Why?@0003
@0009@0013The soldiers of this castle
have wronged me.@0003
@000CWhat?
What do you mean...?@0003
@0009Please give me a bow.
I will fight with you.@0003
[93]
@0010@01E3@0017Useless guards!
But very well.@0003
Witness my magic...and bow
down before its power!@0003
[94]
@0010@01E3
@0017No... My plan...
was flawless...@0003
[95]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0102@000C@0014@0017...You're the granddaughter of one
of the chieftains of Sacae?@0003
@0009My grandfather is the strongest
warrior in Sacae.@0003
People call him the
Silver Wolf.@0003
@000CThe Silver Wolf...
I've heard tales of him.@0003
But what are you doing in Lycia?
This is a long way from Sacae.@0003
@0009Bern invaded Sacae, so the Kutolah
clan decided to take up arms.@0003
Grandfather had the women and
children escape to Lycia, but...@0003
@000C@0012But?@0003
@0009@0013There was a traitor.@0003
@0014The Djute clan, who turned to
Bern's side, ambushed us.@0003
@000C@0012@0016......@0003
@0009@0014@0016We were all separated.@0003
I found my way into this land and
I was rescued by Lord Orun.@0003
But Wagner, his advisor, assassinated
Lord Orun and took over the castle.@0003
@000CAnd that's when you
were captured...@0003
@0009@0013Is your army fighting Bern?@0003
@000CYes, we will fight for
as long as it takes.@0003
@0009Then let me join you.@0003
Fighting Bern may lead
me to Grandfather.@0003
Lord Orun deserves
vengeance as well.@0003
@000CWe're headed for Ostia, in the west.@0003
Sacae is in the east, the opposite
direction. Is that all right?@0003
@0009@0014I don't mind.@0003
No matter where we are, Mother Earth
and Father Sky watch over me.@0003
[96]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017
Lord Roy! The spy I sent to
Ostia has just returned.@0003
He says that Ostia is in
a state of anarchy!@0003
@000C@0080@000DWhat?! Why?@0003
@0009@0014There's been a rebellion among those
who want to surrender to Bern.@0003
@000B@0013Is Lilina safe?@0003
@0009@0014The spy says that she has
been taken hostage.@0003
The rebels already took over Castle Ostia
and are fighting the loyalist soldiers.@0003
@0009@0011
@000B@0013We must hurry to Ostia!
Lilina... Please be safe!@0003
[97]
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Hey! You're...@0003
@0009Oops...@0003
@000CWait!@0003
@0009Hey, cut it out!@0003
Let go of my arm!@0003
Ow! That hurts!@0003
@000COh, I'm sorry.@0003
But what are you doing here?@0003
@0009@0017Well, uh, you know,
this and that.@0003
I'm a busy girl.
Ha ha ha...@0003
@000C@0017Here?
In a battlefield?@0003
@0009@0017
Oh yes, precisely BECAUSE
this is a battlefield--@0003
Whoops, better watch my
tongue...@0003
@000C@0017Do you have some
ulterior motive?@0003
@0009Uh...@0003
@000CWait, is that why you
told us the escape route?@0003
@0009Um, what?@0003
Sorry, I'm a little
deaf in this ear!@0003
@000CJust who are you?@0003
@0009Don't worry about it!
Forget you saw me.@0003@0002
Gotta go. Cheers!@0003@0011
@000CHey, wait!@0003
[98]
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017It's you!@0003
@0009@0017Ugh, you again...
Er, fancy meeting you here!@0003
Ha ha ha...@0003
@000C@0017...You're a thief.@0003
You shouldn't steal.
It's not right.@0003
@0009@0017Nah, it's fine.
I only take from the rich.@0003
No one's going to starve
or anything.@0003
@000C@0017That doesn't make
it any better.@0003
@0009Oh really?
Then let me offer you this.@0003
You nobles take food and money from people
living in what you call your land.@0003
How is tax collection any different
than tribute to a bandit?@0003
@000CWe protect the people
in return!@0003
@0009You do not!@0003
You kill them in
wars like this!@0003
@000CWe didn't start this war.@0003
Bern invaded, so we have
to defend the people...@0003
@0009You can't just do anything you want
and say you're defending us!@0003
How does burning down villages
help us anyway?!@0003
@000CBurning down villages?!
We never--!@0003
Wait a minute, was your...?@0003
@0009...My village was burned to
the ground by our marquess.@0003
He said that he had to do it to
prepare for Bern's attack.@0003
@000CBut...that's...@0003
@0009We always had barely enough to get by,
and then we lost everything...@0003
Our homes... Our crops...@0003
And here you come, saying
it's wrong to steal?@0003
Ha! Look who's talking!@0003
The nobility steals from the poor so you
can live in luxury at our expense!@0003
@000CI...
I don't know what to say.@0003
@0009Sigh. Don't get gloomy.@0003
I really don't like talking about
how pitiful we are anyway.@0003
But you started it.@0003
@000CI...@0003
@0009Ah, to heck with this.@0003
It's no fun stealing after a
conversation like that.@0003@0002
I'm outta here.
Ta-ta!@0003@0011
@000C@0016......@0003
[99]
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Oh! You!@0003
@0009Hm? ...You again?@0003
You always come and
mess up my plans.@0003
Do you have it out for
me or something?@0003
@000CNo!
I just...wanted to apologize.@0003
@0009...Excuse me?@0003
@000CThe last time we met, I was
pretty callous.@0003
I said you shouldn't steal, but I didn't
even realize what you'd been through...@0003
@0009@0017Oh, that? Whatever.
I don't care.@0003
@000C@0017But I still think what
you do is wrong.@0003
@0009You've got some nerve,
you know that?@0003
@000CJust give me
a chance.@0003
@0009A chance?@0003
@000COnce this war is over, I promise to
help rebuild your village.@0003
I'll be sure the taxes are
put to good use too.@0003
Just please, stop looting.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016@0002
How long will that be?@0003
@000CWhenever this war ends.
I can't say when...@0003
@0009And you expect me to wait
patiently until then?@0003
@000CNo. All I want
is your faith.@0003
@0009...Why are you so
kind to me?@0003
I'm just a thief.@0003
@000CWithout you, we wouldn't have
escaped Wagner's trap.@0003
Maybe you didn't care about helping us,
but the fact is that you did.@0003
You saved our lives. You're more than
just a thief.@0003
@0009@0017If things keep going
like they have...@0003
I guess you'll get in my way
no matter where I go.@0003
@000CAs long as you appear
in our path.@0003
@0009Fine, you win.@0003
I'll stop looting
battlefields.@0003
@000CYou will?
Thank you.@0003
@0009But I'm coming
with you.@0003
@000CWhat?
Why?@0003
@0009Actions speak louder
than words.@0003
Prove to me that you'll be true
to your promise.@0003
@000CI won't disappoint you!@0003
[9A]
@0009@0010@013C@000C@0010@0144@0017Is everything quiet,
Debias?@0003
@0009Yes, General. The townspeople are
no trouble.@0003
But the Ilian mercenaries that Hector
hired still refuse to join us.@0003
@000CWhat more do they want?
We already said we'd pay more!@0003
@0009Ilia's mercenary knights
are famously loyal.@0003
@000C@0080@000DI know that, you
bloated imbecile!@0009@0080@000A@0003
@000BBut General Narcian
will arrive soon!@0003
If we don't have Ostia under
our control by then,@0003
he'll never take us
seriously!@0003
@0008@0013Y-yes, General.@0003
@000B@0014Lilina may make for a valuable
bargaining chip with the mercenaries...@0003
If her life is in danger, they
should surrender.@0003
But that must be a last resort.@0003
First we must attempt to beat them
into submission.@0003
The wyvern riders Bern sent us
should prove invaluable!@0003
Debias, I want the mercenaries pacified
and the castle gate secured.@0003
I will be inside the castle readying
our defenses.@0003
@0008@0080@000B@0012Yes, General!@0003
[9B]
@0009@0010@0154@000B@0010@0102@0014@0017How many of Ostia's troops
have joined the rebellion?@0003
@0009Quite a large majority,
I'm afraid.@0003
They've forgotten their fealty
to Lord Hector.@0003
They all simply gave in to
Bern because they're afraid.@0003
It's a disgrace, I tell you.@0003
@000B@0012Is that so...@0003
@0009@0014But it's not all
bad news, Lord Roy!@0003
There's a band of mercenaries from Ilia
that wish to join us to stop the rebels.@0003@001C
@000D@0010@0157Mercenaries from
Ilia, you say?@0003@001C
@0009@0014Oh, yes.@0003
They signed a contract with Lord Hector
to fight Bern alongside Ostia.@0003
@000BThey could be a great help.@0003
But do they know Lord Hector
has passed away?@0003
Isn't their contract void
now that he's gone?@0003
@0009I would have thought
so, too, Lord Roy.@0003
They told me themselves however that they
heard of Lord Hector's passing.@0003
They're still eager to fight with us.@0003@001C
@000DThey're only mercenaries.
Why would they go so far?@0003@001C
@0009Ilia is a frozen land with a harsh
climate so the land is very infertile.@0003
And so, mercenary contracts are a major
source of income in Ilia.@0003
Ilian mercenaries are said to never
betray their employers, no matter what.@0003
It seems that's true indeed.@0003
[9C]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@0132@0014@0017It looks like the Lycian Army has
commenced a counterattack on the rebels.@0003
Let's join them and quell this
shameful little rebellion!@0003
@0009@0012Uh-huh.@0003
@000C@0014Wait,
where's Noah?@0003
@0009Uhhh, I think he went to the
arena a little while ago.@0003
He said he's coaching some
girl in swordplay.@0003
@000CNoah, a coach?
That's not like him...@0003
Has he made a little girlfriend,
I wonder? Ha ha.@0003
Well, no matter.
He can catch up with us later.@0003
@0009@0012Uh-huh.@0003
@000CTime for action.
Move out.@0003
[9D]
@0009@0010@0113@000C@0010@0130@0014@0017Looks like they've started
attacking the rebels.@0003
I need to get going, Fir.@0003
@0009@0014Thank you for helping
me, Sir Noah.@0003
@000COf course.@0003
I sure was surprised when you
came up to me though.@0003
Not many people would challenge someone
to a match so quickly like that.@0003
@0009@0017I-I'm sorry, Sir Noah.@0003
I'd never fought in
the arena before...@0003
@000C@0017If you'd asked anyone else,
you'd be dead now.@0003
You need to look your opponent over
carefully before choosing a fight.@0003
@0009And I must have the humility to surrender
if it appears I'll lose.@0003
@000C@0012Exactly.@0003
@0014You can always get your money back,
but don't throw your life away.@0003
@0009@0012You're right!
Thank you!@0003
@000C@0014What will you do now?@0003
Will you stay here and continue
practicing the sword?@0003
@0009No. I'm going to the
Western Isles.@0003
@000CThe Western Isles?
Why?@0003
@0009They're constructing a new mine, so there
are many new workers headed there.@0003
Miners are strong, so it's no doubt an ideal
place to find new opponents to challenge.@0003
And besides...@0003@000C@0012Yes?@0003
@0009@0014The Western Isles is where my
mother first met my father.@0003
She's passed on, but at my age she traveled
around the world training herself.@0003
@000C@0012So that's it...
You surprise me again.@0003
@0009@0016Why?@0003
@000C@0014@0016I thought all you wanted was
to become strong.@0003
I didn't realize you were following
in your mother's footsteps.@0003
You do have a cute side after all!@0003
@0009...Sir Noah!
Please don't tease me!@0003
@000C@0012Ha ha ha ha!@0003
[9E]
@0009@0010@013C@0014@0017The reinforcements should be
arriving from the south soon.@0003
Heh heh... I want to see the look on their
faces when they get hit from behind!@0003
[9F]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0132@0013@000C@0017Excuse me, are you Sir Zelot of
the Ilian mercenaries?@0003
@0009@0012That's me.
And you are?@0003
@000C@0013My name is Roy.@0003
I lead the army that's
fighting the rebels.@0003
@0009@0014You?@0003
@0009@0013Impressive...
I expected someone older.@0003
@000C@0014I'm here because Lord Hector
asked me to be.@0003
@0009Lord Hector...
We've lost a great man.@0003
He was a true warrior.@0003
@000CWe have to retake Ostia.
For Lord Hector!@0003
And for Lilina...@0003
@0009I concur.@0003
We'll offer what
help we can.@0003
@000CThank you for
the assistance.@0003
@0009Save the thanks for after
we've retaken the castle.@0003
Come! We must concentrate
on the enemy now!@0003
@000CRight!@0003
[A0]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0130@000C@0013@0017Are you one of the
Ilian mercenaries?@0003
@0009@0012Sure am.
Can I help you?@0003
@000C@0013My name is Roy.
I lead the Lycian Army.@0003
@0009@0014@0017Oh! I heard about you...@0003
I'm supposed to take orders
from you now.@0003
@000C@0012@0017Are you sure
that's all right?@0003
@0009What do you mean?@0003
@000C@0013Don't you have to check in
with your commander...?@0003
@0009@0014@0017He told us we're joining the
Lycian Army. That's enough for me.@0003
@000C@0012@0017But did he mean like this?@0003
@0009@0014@0017This is a battlefield.@0003
There's no time to check
everything with the commander.@0003
As long as I'm following orders, and
I am, I can play it by ear.@0003
@000C@0012I see.
Thanks for the help.@0003
[A1]
@000C@0010@0132@0012Noah!@0009@0010@0130@000C@0003
@0009@0013@0017Commander Zelot.
Sorry I'm late.@0003
@000C@0014I heard you were coaching a
girl in swordplay.@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
She was inexperienced and naive,
so I felt obligated.@0003
@000C@0013She isn't with you?@0003
@0009@0014She left. She said she was
heading for the Western Isles.@0003
@000CPity. I thought she might have been of
some help were she still here.@0003
But you, a coach? Since when do you
care about other people?@0003
It's very unlike you.@0003
@0009@0013Do you think so, sir?@0003
@000C@0012Oh, yes.@0003
@0014@0017I even joked with Trec saying
that you fancied the lass.@0003
But THAT wouldn't be like you
in the least, now would it?@0003
@0009@0012@0016......@0003
[A2]
@000C@0010@0132@0009@0010@0131@000C@0013@0017@000CTrec, we're now in service
to the Lycian Army.@0003
@0009OK, I guess.@0003
@000CNot the most enthusiastic
response. You don't like the idea?@0003
@0009Wha?
No, it's fine.@0003
@000COh, well, all right then.
Get to it then.@0003@0011
@0009Lycia, huh...?
Eh, it should all work out.@0003
[A3]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0131@000C@0013@0017Are you one of the
Ilian mercenaries?@0003
@0009@0012Hmmm?
Yeah, I guess so.@0003
@000C@0013My name is Roy.
I lead the Lycian Army.@0003
@0009@0014@0017Oh, I'll take your orders
from now on then.@0003
@000C@0012@0017What?
Just like that?@0003
@0009Hm?@0003
@000C@0013You don't have to check in
with your commander first?@0003
@0009@0014@0017Oh. Nah.@0003
He already said we're joining
the Lycian Army.@0003
@000C@0012@0017But still...@0003
@0009@0014@0017Really, it's fine.
This is a battle.@0003
There's no time to check every
little thing with the commander.@0003
It's not as though I'm going
against his orders anyway.@0003
@000C@0016...All right.@0003
[A4]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0130
@000C@0017Commander Zelot!@0003
@0009Ah, Noah.@0003
I heard you were
at the arena.@0003
@000CYes,
sorry I'm late.@0003
@0009Don't worry yourself...
Things are just getting started.@0003
I haven't even spoken with the
Lycian Army's commander yet.@0003
@000COh?@0003
Actually, I just spoke
to him.@0003
@0009Really?@0003
Then we'll take any commands
he gives from now on.@0003
Noah, I leave further negotiations
with the Lycian League to you.@0003
@000CYes, sir!@0003
[A5]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0131
@000C@0017Commander Zelot.@0003
@0009Trec.
What is it?@0003
@000CI just met with the commander
of the Lycian Army.@0003
@0009Ah, did you?@0003
Then we'll take any commands
he gives from now on.@0003
Trec, I leave further negotiations
with the Lycian League to you.@0003
@000CYes, sir!@0003
[A6]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0132@0013@000C@0017Excuse me, are you Sir Zelot of
the Ilian mercenaries?@0003
@0009@0012That's me.
And you are?@0003
@000C@0013My name is Roy.@0003
I lead the army that's
fighting the rebels.@0003
@0009@0014You?@0003
@0009@0013Impressive...
I expected someone older.@0003
@000C@0014I'm here because Lord Hector
asked me to be.@0003
@0009Lord Hector...
We've lost a great man.@0003
He was a true warrior.@0003
@000CWe have to retake Ostia.
For Lord Hector!@0003
And for Lilina...@0003
@0009I concur.@0003
We'll offer what
help we can.@0003
@000CThank you for the
assistance.@0003
@0009Save the thanks for after
we've retaken the castle.@0003
Come! We must concentrate
on the enemy now!@0003
@000CRight!@0003
[A7]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015ELook at this great
bow I made.@0003
It fires arrows much farther
than a normal bow!@0003
Very useful, don't you think?
Of course you do.@0003
You can have it.
I want it to go to good use.@0003
[A8]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0161
@000COh, this? This is a torch staff.
It creates light in foggy places.@0003
If you're in fog, you can't
attack anything you can't see.@0003
This should be helpful if you ever
find yourself in that situation.@0003
[A9]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015C
@000CWould you like to buy some elixir?
It'll patch your wounds right up!@0003
The recipe is top secret...
Don't ask, because I'm not telling!@0003
What's that?
You don't want any?@0003
Here, I'll give you a free sample!
You won't be disappointed.@0003
[AA]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0160
@0017Ostia is Lycia's greatest city!
But now look at it...@0003
What did you say? You're out
to restore our former glory?@0003
Then please,
take this gem...@0003
It'll fetch a high price
at any store!@0003
Just use the money
to help Ostia!@0003
[AB]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0167
@000C@0017Are you going to help Lady Lilina?@0003
Here's a staff that can heal
injuries from a distance!@0003
If Lady Lilina's hurt,
please heal her...@0003
[AC]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015F
@000C@0017A while back, I saw a man
dying in the street.@0003
I helped him out, and he gave
me this sword.@0003
Really strange person, but kind...
Hm? This is the sword.@0003
You can have it!
Take good care of it.@0003
[AD]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0152@0017General Legance has allied
himself with Bern!@0003
He had all who resisted him
killed... I escaped, though.@0003
Please take this. It's a
Hero crest.@0003
Give this to an experienced hero,
and fight to save Ostia...@0003
[AE]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015E
Cavaliers, paladins...
Mounted knights like those.@0003
This lance is incredibly effective
against such soldiers.@0003
There are many horsemen in the rebel
army, so use this against them!@0003
[AF]
@0010@013C@0017You...you beat Bern's
wyvern riders!?@0003
Ergh...
I'll not let you pass!@0003
[B0]
@0010@013C@0017General Legance...
Please be cautious...@0003
These people are...
powerful...@0003
[B1]
@000C@0010@0102@0014@0017The city is finally
under control.@0003
@000C@0080@000DNow let us retake Castle Ostia
and rescue Lilina!@0003
@0009@0010@0154Lord Roy, I understand your
apprehension, but please be patient!@0003
We still need to break down
the castle gate.@0003
@000B@0080@000E...Lilina.@0003
@0009@0014Speaking of Lady Lilina...@0003
What do you think of what
Lord Hector said?@0003
@000CYou mean about the dragons?@0003
They were real, not just myth...@0003
Lord Hector was one of the
greatest tacticians in Lycia.@0003
And yet his army was defeated in
the blink of an eye...@0003
@0009Bern's army is perhaps the
strongest in Elibe.@0003
I say, those wyvern riders were
indeed very formidable opponents.@0003
@000COf course the wyvern riders must
have been difficult enough.@0003
But the dragons... I can't even
conceive how powerful they must be.@0003
Lord Hector mentioned a weapon that
is effective against dragons...@0003
I wonder where it's hidden.@0003@0080@0004
@0009I presume it must be one of
the legendary weapons.@0003
@000CIf we can obtain those, we might have a
fighting chance against the dragons.@0003
But I do wonder what a legendary
weapon is doing in Ostia.@0003
@0009Perhaps Lady Lilina knows
the answer. I'm curious as well.@0003
Oh!@0003
Lord Roy, our men have finished
knocking down the gate.@0003
We can enter now!@0003
@000C@0080@000DAll right! Forward charge!@0003
Rescue Lilina, no matter
the cost!@0003
[B2]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0144@0017
@0080@000EThe enemy has broken
into the castle?!@0003
How could Debias have
failed against them?!@0003
Were those Ilian mercenaries
that skilled?@0003
...Or was the Lycian Army larger
than we expected...?@0003
Whatever the case, they have broken into
the impregnable Castle Ostia!@0003@0009@0011
@000CWe must defeat them here, or we'll
be a laughing stock in Bern...@0003@0002
You over there!@0003
@0009@0010@01D7Yes, General!@0003
@000CHave the troops take defensive positions
throughout the castle!@0003
Particularly around the throne room!@0003
We must not allow the Lycian Army
any further into the castle!@0003
@0009Of course, General!@0003
@000C@0080@000DOne other matter.@0003
I want you to have Lilina quietly
assassinated during the battle.@0003
@0009@0080@000AWhat? ...I thought we
were to keep her alive.@0003
@000BI felt she might make
a valuable hostage.@0003
But many of our rebel soldiers
still swear loyalty to her.@0003
If we openly use her as a hostage,
those soldiers may turn.@0003
@0008If that's the case, General, would they not
also turn if we assassinate her?@0003
@000B@0080@000DThat's why I said to do
it quietly, isn't it?!@0003
Kill her discreetly, and say that
she was hit by a stray arrow.@0003
We can hold the enemy responsible!
Now go!@0003
@0008Yes, General...@0003
[B3]
@000C@0010@0102@0005
@0008@0010@011D...General Roy of Pherae,
I presume.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0017Who are you?!
An enemy?!@0003
@0008@0017No, no. I'm on your side.
My name is Astolfo.@0003
I used to work here in the
service of the marquess.@0003
@000D@0010@0154What kind of work were
you doing exactly?@0003
You certainly aren't dressed
like a servant...@0003
@0008A bit nosy, don't you
think, old man?@0003
I'm a spy, see.@0003
I gather information, steal things,
check on people... Things like that.@0003
@000DThat explains it.@0003@0011
@0008I'm not much of a spy if you can tell I
work for a noble at first glance, am I?@0003
@0008@0017I've been running around Lycia gathering
intelligence for about a month now.@0003
When I heard about Araphen, I got back
as quickly as my legs would allow.@0003
And what do I find but those muttonheads
Legance and Debias inciting rebellion!@0003
I couldn't save Lord Hector, but I
won't let them take Lady Lilina.@0003
@000BThen you'll join us?
Do you know where Lilina is?@0003
@0008Of course. Finding that
stuff out is my job.@0003
Lady Lilina is locked in a small room
in the heart of the castle.@0003
And Legance is sitting on the
throne like he owns the place.@0003
@000BWe have to hurry then.@0003
We must defeat the rebels and save Lilina
before Narcian arrives from Bern!@0003
[B4]
@000C@0010@0122@0014@0017What's all that noise?
Is there a battle going on?@0003
I wish I could see outside
this chamber...@0003
[B5]
@000D@0010@0116@0014@0017Sir Barthe,
it's a dead end!@0003
@0009@0010@0108@0014This wall has cracks in it.@0003
We can break it down if we hit
it with our weapons.@0003
@000B@0010@01BDI wonder where
Lady Lilina is.@0003
@0009I have a pretty good idea
of where she might be.@0003
I've known this castle
for a long time.@0003
I do wonder what's causing
all the noise, though.@0003
@000BThe Lycian Army, perhaps?@0003
My brother must be
with them...@0003
@0009...We can't be sure he's
still alive.@0003
You had best keep your
hopes low.@0003
@000B@0013Ah...
Yes, you're right.@0003
@000D@0014Sir Barthe, must you
be so aloof?@0003
Bors is Gwendolyn's only brother.@0003
@0009@0013We must always stand
firmly in reality.@0003
@000D@0012But--@0003
@000B@0013It's all right, Ogier.
Sir Barthe is right.@0003
@0009@0014As a knight of Ostia,
you must always remain calm.@0003
It matters not how grave the
situation.@0003
Understood, Gwendolyn?@0003
@000B@0012...Yes, sir.@0003
[B6]
@0009@0010@012COh baby!@0003
Just as I thought.
They're at it again.@0003
How stupid can these
nobles get?@0003
I'll never understand what fun
it is fighting all the time.@0003
Oh well. I'll take the opportunity
to swipe what I can.@0003
[B7]
@000C@0010@0102@0012Lilina!@0003
@0009@0010@0122...Roy?@0005
Is it really you?@0003
@000CYes, it's me!@0003
@0009You came!
Thank you so much.@0003
@000C@0014I'm so glad you're unhurt.
Here, take this spell tome.@0003
Use it to defend yourself for
the time being.@0003
@0009@0013Thanks.@0003
[B8]
@0009@0010@01BD@0012Bors!
You're all right!@0003
@000C@0010@0109@0013Is that you, Gwendolyn?@0003
I'm so glad to see
you in one piece.@0003@0002
@0017Wha...!? What...what's
that you're wearing?!@0003
Did you join up with
the Ostian knights?@0003
@0009@0017Ah... Actually, yes.
I was knighted just yesterday.@0003
@000C@0014@0017What are you thinking...?@0003
I told you to leave the fighting
to me and live as you wish!@0003
You didn't need to become
a knight...@0003
@0009@0013@0017Yes, well, I thought about it, and I
realized that this is what I want.@0003
@000C@0012@0017But...@0003
@0009@0014I don't want to sit idly by and wait
for you to return from battle.@0003
I want to be a great knight,
just like you.@0003
@000C@0012@0016......@0003
@0009@0016...Bors?@0003
@000C@0014@0017You've always been a
stubborn one, Gwendolyn.@0003
@0009@0012@0017Bors...@0003
@000C@0014@0017Live as you wish.@0003
If Mother and Father were alive,
I'm certain they'd say the same...@0003
But the life of a knight
is never easy!@0003
@0009@0013@0017Yes, I'm prepared!
I'm ready for the challenge!@0003
[B9]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0109
Lady Lilina!
You are unharmed!@0003
@0009Bors, I'm sorry that
I worried you.@0003
@000CNot at all, milady!
You are well...@0003
That in itself is
enough for me.@0003
@0009Thank you, Bors.@0003
And you kept your promise
to protect Roy.@0003
I knew I could
depend on you.@0003
@000CThank you, milady!@0003
[BA]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0108
@0009@0017Barthe!@0003
@000CLady Lilina!
I am overjoyed to see you safe.@0003
@0009@0017Barthe, you were right.
Legance was planning this rebellion.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I'm sorry...@0003
If only I'd trusted your word,
this would not have happened...@0003
@000CNo...@0003
Lady Lilina, you have
nothing to apologize for.@0003
Legance betrayed your
kindness and trust.@0003
He is the one responsible
for this.@0003
@0017It is your undying kindness that we
soldiers respect the most, milady.@0003
@0009Barthe...@0003
[BB]
@0010@0144@0017Dogs of the Lycian Army...
Come.@0003
I shall cut you down
where you stand!@0003
[BC]
@0010@0144@0017How? You will only...
be crushed by Bern...@0003
How can you fight with
such conviction...?@0003
[BD]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0102
@000CWe've finally retaken
the castle, Lilina.@0003
@0009Thank you, Roy.@0003
I'm glad that my father didn't have
to go to the trouble.@0003
@000C@0017@0016!@0003@0016
@0009@0017Roy, is my father still in Araphen?@0003
I heard there was a horrible battle there,
but how much longer will he be?@0003
@000C@0017Lilina...
You haven't heard?@0003
@0009@0017Heard what?@0003
@0080@0004@000C@0017Lord Hector...
passed on.@0003
@0009What...?@0003
@000CI'm sorry... By the time we arrived
at Castle Araphen...@0003
It was already under Bern's control.@0003
@0009It's not your fault...
Don't apologize.@0003
@000CLord Hector had been fatally
wounded when we arrived.@0003
If only we had gotten there sooner,
we could have helped him...@0003
@0009@0017No...
I...was prepared for this...@0003
I'm the daughter of
a warrior.@0003
I've been taught to steel myself
in times such as these.@0003
@000C@0017Lilina.@0003
@0009Everybody kept it from me...
They didn't want to hurt me...@0003
But I'm strong... I can
handle this...@0003
@000CLilina, you don't have
to hold back...@0003
@0009Roy... I...@0003
@000CWe'll get through this...
I'm here for you.@0003
[BE]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102@0009@0014@0017Lord Roy! Bern's wyvern riders
are in front of Castle Ostia!@0003
@000C@0080@000DWhat?!
They're here already?!@0003
[BF]
@0008@0010@0142@000D@0010@0102@0008@0016Hm @0005hm @0005hm...@0003
@0016You must be Roy.@0003
I thank you for ridding me
of that cretin Legance.@0003
@0008@0080@000BNow, leave Ostia to me and we can all
go home with our limbs attached.@0003
@000D@0080@000D@0017Never!@0003
I'll never hand Ostia over to
the likes of you...!@0003
@0009@0017Oho?@0003
You think you can best us with that
sad little group of yours?@0003
@0009@0080@000CI will cut you open,
just as I did to Hector!@0003
@000B@0012@0017@0016......@0016@0003
@000FThat's enough!@0003
[C0]
@0009@0010@0142@0005
@000B@0010@01D7@0014General Narcian!
A legion has arrived from Etruria!@0003
@000B@0011@0009@0017I can see that, you fool!
But why...?@0003
@000C@0010@011A@0013I am Perceval,
Knight General of Etruria.@0003
@0014Mage General Cecilia informed me that the
Lycian Army had requested Etruria's aid.@0003
@0009@0012What...?!@0003@001C
@000C@0011@000C@0010@0134@0014@0017We are prepared for battle.@0003
Can those wyvern riders of yours
stand against our might?@0003
@0009@0017You...!@0003
@000CI am Cecilia,
Mage General of Etruria!@0003
Ostia is now under our
protection.@0003
@0009@0080@000CArgh...!
You...you...!!!@0003
@0008@0010@01D7@0014General Narcian,
please control your temper!@0003
General Perceval is one of the
most skilled knights in Etruria!@0003
Combined with General Cecilia,
we haven't a chance!@0003
@000AI know that!
We're leaving!@0003
@0008@0011@000A@0080@000ACecilia, was it?@0003
We'll see who has
the last laugh!@0003
[C1]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Are you General Roy of
the Lycian Army?@0003
@000CY-yes, I am!@0003
I lead the Lycian Army
in Lord Hector's place.@0003
@0009It's a pleasure.@0003
You have my sympathy for the
current turmoil in Lycia.@0003
Our king also sends his
condolences for Lord Hector.@0003
@000CThank you.@0003
If you hadn't helped us...Ostia
would be under Bern's control now.@0003
@0009You have no reason to thank me.
I simply followed my king's orders.@0003
You should thank Cecilia. She defied the
king until he agreed to help you.@0003
@000CShe...
opposed the king?@0003
@0009Yes, she put her neck on the line.@0003
Well, I must be off.@0003
Etruria calls. As one of the three Generals
of Etruria, it requires my presence.@0003
Cecilia,@000C@0011@000C@0010@0134
@0009will you take care of the loose ends?@0003
@000CYes. Thank you, Perceval.
Leave the rest to me.@0003
[C2]
@000C@0010@0102@0017Wow...
General Perceval...@0003
Just his presence was
intimidating.@0003
@0009@0010@0134@0017Nervous, were you?@0003
@000CGeneral Cecilia!
It is good to see you again.@0003
@0009How are you, Roy?
You look a little tired.@0003
@000CI'm fine, thanks to you.
It could have been a calamity.@0003
@0009I'm glad we made
it in time.@0003
@000C@0014@0017I'm sorry I put you through
so much trouble.@0003
@0009Don't be.@0003
It will benefit Etruria for Ostia
to go under our protection.@0003
@000CBenefit Etruria?
How?@0003
@0009Bern's been increasingly
aggressive, as you know.@0003
If Bern gains any further strength, the
balance of power will be shattered.@0003
Still, we haven't been attacked, so
we couldn't simply declare war.@0003
@000CSo when we requested aid, it was
justification to declare war on Bern?@0003
@0009Precisely.@0003
We only did what is
best for our land.@0003
You needn't feel that
you're in our debt.@0003
@000C@0013If you insist.@0003
@000CRegardless, please come in and
meet the rest of the army.@0003
[C3]
@0009@0010@0134...He's grown so much in the short
time since I met him last.@0003
He's maturing into a man.@0003
[C4]
@0010@0108@0017Show the enemy the
power of the Ostian knights!@0003
Triangle Attack!!@0003
[C5]
@0010@0109@0017Ready?
Charge!@0003
Triangle Attack!!@0003
[C6]
@0010@01BD@0017Uh...
Let's go!@0003
Triangle Attack!!@0003
[C7]
@0009@0010@0151@000C@0010@013E
@0009@0017Boss! The Lycians
are here!@0003
@000C@0013You sure?@0003
@0009@0014Oh yeah. We just saw 'em dock at
that little island in the east.@0003
@000C@0014Good. They're probably floundering
about in this thick fog.@0003
Sneak up from where they can't
see and finish 'em.@0003
@0009@0012Sure thing, Boss.@0003
[C8]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0134
@0009@0017Roy, I'm sorry that
I couldn't stop this.@0003
@000CIt isn't your responsibility, General
Cecilia. Don't concern yourself.@0003
@0009Even in Etruria people dislike how the high
chancellor treats the Lycians as pawns.@0003
@000CHigh chancellor? I thought the king
made the decision to send us here.@0003
@0009Actually, he didn't. High Chancellor Roartz
works closely with Lord Arcardo,@0003
the noble who heads the mining operations
here in the Western Isles.@0003
They made the decision without
consulting the king.@0003
@000CThey have that power?@0003
How?@0003
@0009...Did you hear of the tragedy that
occurred in Etruria last year?@0003
@000COf course.@0003
Prince Myrddin, next in line to be king,
abruptly passed away last year.@0003
@0009Yes, that's it.@0003
@000CI never had the honor to
make his acquaintance.@0003
I understand that he was a very
bright individual.@0003
@0009Yes... Were the prince alive, Etruria
would surely not be in this sad shape.@0003
King Mordred was overcome with sorrow
when his son departed.@0003
The shock was so great that he has
yet to recover.@0003
Of late, it seems he's always detached
from reality.@0003
He pays no mind to anything happening
around him or in the kingdom.@0003@0002
Roartz is exploiting the king's
condition for his own benefit.@0003
Now, he's essentially in charge
of the goings-on in the palace.@0003
He keeps the three Etrurian Generals,
Perceval, Douglas, and myself,@0003
away from the king except in times
of great urgency.@0003
[C9]
@000B@0013Then they should be
powerful allies.@0003
@0009@0014I agree! Fortune is
still with us!@0003@0017
But...the mercenary I spoke to
also had some bad news.@0003
He said one of the three Wyvern Generals is
headed here with a legion of wyvern riders.@0003
Should they aid the rebels, our chance of
victory will be all but gone.@0003@001C
@000D@0013Roy... What are you going to do?@0003@001C
@000B@0014...The Kingdom of Etruria
might help us.@0003@001C
@000D@0013Etruria?!
Is it possible?@0003@001C
@000BGeneral Cecilia, Mage General of Etruria,
was my teacher in tactics at Ostia.@0003
I feel she may join forces with
us if we ask.@0003
@0009I object, Lord Roy!@0003
If we have Etruria solve this Lycian matter,
our reputation with them will never recover!@0003
@000BThat may be so...@0003
But this is a matter of life or death
for Lycia.@0003
We must ask for help, for if we don't, Lycia
as we know it may become just a memory.@0003
@0009...Lord Roy.@0003
@000BBut we must act quickly! I've already
penned a letter to General Cecilia.@0003
Merlinus, I need you to send the
letter to her right away.@0003
@0009...Yes, Lord Roy!
I trust your judgment.@0003
I shall send it this
instant.@0003
@000BWith any luck, she'll
make it in time.@0003@0002
Get ready for combat, soldiers!
We will retake Ostia!@0003
[CA]
@000C@0017But what about when you came
to our aid in Ostia?@0003
@0009That was an exception because
I had Perceval behind me.@0003
But I'm sorry, I didn't have
the clout to prevent this...@0003
@000CI don't blame you.@0003
We will return to Lycia as soon as
we complete our mission here.@0003
But please, I only ask that you take
care of Lycia in our absence.@0003
@0009You needn't ask.@0003
The Lycian League is in safe hands,
as is Princess Guinivere.@0003@0011
@0008@0010@0157Roy...
May I not go with you?@0003
@000CThe battles on these islands
are likely to be ugly.@0003
I can't predict what might
happen.@0003
You should stay in hiding in Etruria
with General Cecilia's protection.@0003
@001C
@000A@0010@0134You can trust me, Your Highness.@0003
I know you want a truce to end
this war.@0003
I will defend you no
matter the cost.@0003@001C
@0008...I understand.
I'm truly sorry to trouble you.@0003
Roy, I pray for your safety.@0003
@000C@0017Thank you, Your Highness.
I will pray for yours as well.@0003
[CB]
@000C@0010@013E
@0009@0010@0113@0012@0017Scott!@0003
@000C@0013@0017Oh, Fir.
Sorry to call you in.@0003
@0009@0014@0017What's going on out there?@0003
@000CThe island is under
attack by pirates.@0003
They've come to kill the
people living here.@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0013What?!@0003
@000C@0014I sent some guys over to try and stop
them, but the pirates are very skilled.@0003
The outlook isn't good.@0003
@000A@0012I can't believe it...@0003
@000C@0014I'd like to fight them myself,
but I can't leave this castle.@0003
Fir, I'm sorry, but can
you go in my place?@0003
@000A@0014Yes. I will go and purge the
people of these pirates.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Yeah, thanks.@0003
@000A@0013@0017Leave them to my blade!@0003
Anyone who attacks innocent villagers
will get no mercy from me!@0003
@000C@0013I have someone you
can work with too.@0003
@000A@0012You do?@0003
@000C@0014Yeah. He's a nomad named Sin.@0003
He's a little skinny, but he's
a decent shot with his bow.@0003
[CC]
@000C@0010@013E
@0009@0010@0151@0017Boss, you sure? I mean, that
girl won't have any chance...@0003
@000C@0017I know what I'm doing.@0003
Once she's killed, we can take
that sword she's carrying.@0003
@0009@0017The sword?
That weird one she has?@0003
@000C@0017It's not just any weird sword. It's a
Wo Dao, a famous blade from the east.@0003
It's worth a fortune. Heh heh...@0003
@0009Ohhh, I get it now.@0003
@0014That's why you were so
hospitable to her.@0003
@000CI couldn't do anything before,
but now's our chance.@0003
I want you to follow her.@0003
Once she's finished, take the sword
from her lifeless hands!@0003
@0009@0012Sure thing, Boss!@0003
[CD]
@000C@0010@0105@0009@0010@0113@0012@0017Are you...
Sin?@0003
@000C@0013Yes.@0003
I heard everything from Scott.
Let's go.@0003
@0009@0012@0016......@0003
@000C@0012......@0003
@0009@0012@0016So, uh...@0003
@000C@0012What?@0003
@0009@0014@0017Uh, are you here to
protect the villagers like me?@0003
@000C@0017No... I have no interest
in such things.@0003
@0009@0013Then why are you here?@0003
@000C@0014I'm paid to fight.@0005
That is all.@0003
@0009@0012@0016......@0003
@000C@0012......@0016@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0013...I need to keep the 
conversation going.@0003@0002
@000C@0010@0105@0005@0009@0017Uh... You're from Sacae,
right?@0003
@000C@0012@0017Right.@0003
@0009@0013@0017What brings you all
the way out here?@0003
@000C@0013@0017Nothing special. You appear to be
from Sacae yourself.@0003
@0009@0014@0017As for me, I'm traveling around
Elibe to train myself, and...@0003
Oh, you didn't ask about me,
did you...?@0003
@000C@0012@0017@0016......@0003
@0009@0012@0016...Sigh.@0003
@000C@0014...I'm looking for someone.@0003
@0009@0014Who?@0003
@000C...My clan was crushed by Bern
when they invaded Sacae.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000COur chieftain had me escape and told me
to find and protect his granddaughter.@0003
I'm still in search of her.@0003
@0009I see...
Well, I hope you find her.@0003
@000C...Me too.@0003
[CE]
@0009@0010@0113@000C@0010@0130
@000C@0014Fir!
It is you!@0003
@0009@0013Sir Noah?!
What are you doing here?!@0003
@000C@0014I joined this army
back in Ostia...@0005 Whoa!@0003@0011
@000C@0010@0130@0017What are you doing?!
Sheathe your sword!@0003
@0009Sir Noah! You aren't the noble
man I thought you were!@0003
@000C@0012What?@0003
@0009@0014I know you're a mercenary...
But lending your services to pirates?!@0003
You should be ashamed!@0003
@000C@0012...What?@0003
@0009@0014Don't act like you don't know!@0003
You're working with pirates to
attack the people living here!@0003
And you call yourself a knight?!@0003
@000C@0017Hold on, I think there's been
some kind of misunderstanding...@0003
@0009@0017Misunderstanding?!
You still have the nerve--@0003
@000C@0017We're trying to help
the villagers.@0003
Our goal is to defeat the
head of the pirate group here.@0003
His name is Scott, I think.@0003
@0009@0017What? Scott is the head
of the pirates?@0003
@000C@0017Sure is. If you don't believe me why
don't you ask the pirate over there?@0003
The one behind you, hiding in
the bushes.@0003
@0009@0017Pirate?
What pirate--?@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0011@000C@0010@0113@0009@0010@0151
@0009@0014The plan failed! I gotta
go tell the boss!@0003@0011
@000C@0012Hey!
Come back here!@0003@0011
@0009@0010@0113@000C@0010@0130@000C@0017...You didn't suspect
them at all?@0003
@0009No! Scott was very
kind to me...@0003
@000CReally? The rumors say that
he's a brute of a man...@0003
@0009@0017My mother always said that you shouldn't
judge a person by their looks...@0003
@000C@0017Well, certainly,
but...@0003
@0009@0017...I was fighting for
pirates this whole time...@0003
What should I do now?@0003
@000C@0017Do you want to
come with us?@0003
@0009@0013Truly?
Can I?@0003
@000C@0014We're always looking for new
recruits to bolster our strength.@0003
I'll talk to Roy for you.@0003
@0009@0013Thank you!@0003
[CF]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0105
@000C@0012Sue!@0003
@0009@0013@0017Sin...
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0014@0017I was looking for you.@0003
@0009@0012@0017For me? Why?@0003
@000C@0017The chieftain told me to.@0003
@0009@0013@0017...What happened to
the clan after I left?@0003
@000CWe were no equal
for Bern...@0003
@0009@0012...We lost.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009@0013What happened to
my grandfather?@0003
@000C@0014He still continues the
resistance against Bern...@0003
@0009@0012Is that so...@0003
@000C@0012I was told by the chieftain
to find and protect you.@0003
@0009@0013Then you will fight
alongside us?@0003
@000CWith you?@0003
@0009@0014This army is fighting against Bern, like
my grandfather. They also saved my life.@0003
@000C@0013Then of course.@0003
If that is what you desire,
I am at your disposal.@0003
@0009@0017Thank you.@0003
[D0]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0187
@0017This whole area is basically
pirate territory.@0003
They take everything
from us.@0003@0002
Resist, you say?
It's of no use.@0003
They can do whatever they want
because of their numbers.@0003
We can't fight against them
like the resistance force.@0003
[D1]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018A
@0002You saved us!@0003
Are you with the resistance?@0005
No?@0003
Then you just did it out of the
goodness of your heart?@0003
As I'm sure you've seen, these islands
are swarming with pirates and bandits!@0003
There's nothing we can do out here,@0003
but word is the resistance is waging
battle in the western part of the Isles.@0003
Tell them we'll all move to the mainland.
They don't have to worry about us...@0003
[D2]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0185
@0017The only people here are
women and children.@0003
All the workers have been
taken north to the mines.@0003
They aren't even allowed to rest.
They're forced to work until they die...@0003
My brother escaped, but he
was reduced to skin and bone.@0003
That day he came back, he was already
too weak, and he drew his last breath...@0003
Now that I've told you this...can you...@0003
Er, sorry...@0003
I've said too much.
Please forget all of this.@0003
We'll leave the Isles now.@0003
[D3]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015C
There's so much mist here...@0003
In these conditions, you can never
know if someone's waiting to pounce!@0003
Torches can be very useful, even if
you have an eagle-eyed thief with you.@0003
[D4]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0188
The resistance is faring quite well.@0003
In the north and in the west,
they're always engaged in battle.@0003
Which way will you go?@0003
[D5]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0186
Among the pirates is a very
skilled nomad...@0003
You can't see him
through all this fog,@0003
but he also has a girl
with him...@0003
[D6]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0188
The nearby villagers...@0003
They're all deserting the
Isles for the mainland.@0003
It's very sad, really.@0003
If you want to visit, you'd
best do it quickly.@0003
You won't have time to go to both,
so you'll have to decide.@0003
[D7]
@0010@013E@0017Maybe the fog
didn't stop you...@0003
But you must be in rough
shape at least!@0003
I'll finish you off!@0003
[D8]
@0010@013E@0017Who...
are you?@0003
You're no ordinary army...@0003
[D9]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Merlinus, it appeared the enemy
was trying to ambush us...@0003
@0009They must have known
we were coming.@0003
@000C@0013I think there's more to this
than we realize...@0003
@0009You're right. Clearing out the bandits
may be more difficult than expected.@0003
Ever since Bern's aggressive behavior
started, Elibe has changed.@0003
@000CI don't even know what to expect...@0003
Dragons appearing, Bern's sudden invasion,
the collapse of the Lycian League...@0003
Everything happened so suddenly.@0003
In the end I suppose all we can do is
take it one problem at a time.@0003
[DA]
@0009@0013@0017Now...
Where do we go from here?@0003
@000C@0014Let's move north
along the coast.@0003
@0009North...
Toward the mines?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
I hear the people living on the islands are
being forced into slave labor there.@0003
@0009So you think we
should rescue them.@0003
@000CIf we do, we might be able to
find out who's behind all of this.@0003
@0009Well, we must start
somewhere.@0003
@000CThen let's not waste time...
Let's head north.@0003
[DB]
@0009@0013@0017Now...
Where do we go from here?@0003
@000C@0014Let's head west.@0003
@0009West?@0003
@000CI heard there's a resistance
group based there.@0003
They're fighting the bandits
to protect the villagers.@0003
@0009They may have information on
what's going on in the Isles.@0003
@000CIndeed.
We need a lead.@0003
@0009It seems like a sound idea,
Lord Roy.@0003
@000CThen let's not waste time.
Let's move west.@0003
[DC]
@0009@0014@0017Now...
Where do we go from here?@0003
We must choose a direction.@0003
@000C@0013Do you have any ideas?@0003
@0009@0014If we follow the coast north, we will
reach the largest mine on the Isles.@0003
The bandits may be based
around there.@0003
@000CAh, that makes sense.@0003
@0009We have an assignment, and it's
to get rid of the bandits.@0003
We mustn't wander about
aimlessly wasting time.@0003
@000C@0013You're right.
Let's head north!@0003
[DD]
@000C@0010@01E4@0017What can you tell me about
that spy from the resistance?@0003
@0008@0010@01D7You mean the dancer
called Larum?@0003
We threw her in the
dungeon, milord.@0003
@000C@0013Has she told
you anything?@0003
@0008@0014No. She keeps insisting that she's
not affiliated with the resistance.@0003@0011
@000C@0017A liar, is she?@0003
Perhaps I should
interrogate her myself...@0003
@0009@0010@01D7@0013@0017Sir Nord!@0003
@000C@0012What is it?@0003
@0009@0014There is a messenger here
from the Lycian Army.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0012Ah, the army that was sent to
clean up the bandits on the Isles.@0003
@0009@0014It seems that they want permission
to pass through to Eburacum.@0003
@000B@0017...Lord Arcardo told us to get rid of
the Lycian Army in their time here.@0003
Heh heh heh... If we impress Lord Arcardo
he may see fit to reward us.@0003
@0017Deploy the troops and
finish them here!@0003
@0009Yes, milord...@0003@0002
And the messenger?@0003
@000BKill him.@0003
@0009@0012Understood, milord.@0003
@000BBe sure to deploy
the ballista.@0003
Use it to defeat the Lycian Army
before they even reach you!@0003
@0009@0013Yes, milord.@0003
@000B@0014Just make sure the enemy
doesn't get hold of it!@0003
[DE]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Lord Roy, soldiers are
flowing out from the castle.@0003
@000C@0013Are there bandits
around here?@0003
@0009@0014No, they seem to be
heading toward us, actually.@0003
@000C...What about the messenger?@0003
@0009He hasn't returned...
Which may mean the worst...@0003
@000CHe hasn't returned?@0003
Why is Sir Nord attacking us?@0003
@0009The enemy draws near...
Lord Roy, what are your orders?@0003
@000C...I guess we have no
choice but to fight.@0003
We might learn something if
we can reach the castle.@0003
@0009Yes, milord.
You're right.@0003
@000CAll right, storm the castle!@0003
But have mercy! Some of their soldiers
may be willing to listen!@0003
[DF]
@000C@0010@01E4@0017Gonzalez!
Gonzalez, where are you?!@0003
@0009@0010@012F@0013Here... I here...@0003
@000C@0014There's a village to the north,
right along the mountain.@0003
Do you understand?@0003
@0009@0012Understand.@0003
@000C@0014It may be a resistance base.@0003
I want you to go and burn it to
the ground, village and all.@0003
@0009@0012Village and all...@0003
@000C@0013Good. You understand.@0003
This is the only use I have
for a lump such as you.@0003
Now get going, you halfwit,
before you forget your orders.@0003
@0009@0012I...I...@0003
@000C@0014Forget how to speak?
Are you trying to say something?@0003
@0009@0012N-no...@0003@0011
@000C@0014Such a monstrous face, and yet such
a needlessly compassionate heart.@0003
He will learn the value of
destroying a village firsthand!@0003
[E0]

[E1]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@0184
@000C@0017Geese...
You're really leaving?@0003
@0009The lord of that castle
killed my mates.@0003
I won't let their deaths
go unavenged.@0003
@000CYou mean that crew that
was always with you...@0003
@0009Yeah...@0003
They were taken to the mines and told
that they would be given work.@0003
But they were all worked like
slaves until they...@0005died.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Maybe they weren't the brightest
bunch, but they were good people...@0003
And then they were killed...
just like that...!!@0003
@000CDo you intend to avenge
them on your own?@0003
@0009Is there something wrong
with that?@0003
@000CNo...@0003
But I thought you were going to go
back to your merchant business.@0003
@0009Yeah, well, I've got bigger
problems now...@0003
Once my mates get their revenge, and
once the war subsides, maybe I will.@0003
@000C@0017...We won't forget you, Geese.@0003
You and your crew risked your lives
to get us food and supplies.@0003
If you ever need anything,
we'll be here.@0003
@0009Maybe I'll take you up on that,
if I'm still alive.@0003
...Thanks.@0003

@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Are you with
Etruria?!@0003
@000C@0013Y-yes...@0003
@0009@0014We fight for the people
suffering under your tyranny!@0003
En garde!@0003
@000C@0013W-wait!
We're on your side!@0003
@0009@0014You aren't with
the castle?@0003
@000CWe're trying to capture
it, actually.@0003
@0009Oh!
Sorry then.@0003
@000CI am Roy, leader of
the Lycian Army.@0003
@0009Lycia?
You've come a long way...@0003
@000CWe were sent by Etruria to rid
the Isles of the bandits.@0003
@0009What's that?!
So you are with Etruria!@0003
@000CPlease calm yourself!
We share the same goal.@0003
We want to bring peace
to the Isles.@0003
@0009...You may end up against
Etrurian nobility.@0003
@000C...Our mission is to find and
eliminate wrongdoers on the Isles.@0003
Social status matters not.@0003
@0009@0013You, my friend, are
a man of conviction!@0003
Very well! I think I'll
join your little army!@0003
@000C@0013You'll help us?
Thank you!@0003
[E3]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@0113
@000C@0013@0017Father?
What are you doing here?@0003
@0009@0017Fir!
I've been looking for you.@0003
@000C@0014@0017Father,
I've already made up my mind.@0003
I want to become a great master
of the sword like Mother...@0003
@0009@0017That is good.
I don't intend to drag you home.@0003
In fact, I want to help you
in your journey.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Help me?@0003
@0009@0014I know well the hardships one faces
in a journey of self-improvement.@0003
I can help you out of a bind if
things get rough.@0003
@000CBut Father, if you keep helping me,
my training is meaningless.@0003
@0009@0012Nonsense.@0003
@0014With your old man around, we can
practice sparring any time!@0003
Do you refuse your
father's love?!@0003
@000C@0013No! It's nothing
like that, but...@0003
@0009@0017It's settled then.@0003
But first we capture
the castle.@0003
@0011@000C@0012@0017Sigh...@0003
@0014I guess I should tell Roy that
we have another member...@0003
[E4]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0122
@000C@0012@0017Excuse me!@0003
@0009@0013W-what you doing?!
I am enemy!@0003
@000C@0014I know...@0003
But there's such a look of
sorrow in your eyes.@0003
@0009...There is village near
mountain. You know?@0003
@000C@0013Yes, I know it.@0003
@0009Tell people escape.
I have order. Destroy village.@0003
I...@0003
@000C@0014What? Don't!@0003
The villagers
are innocent...@0003
@0009@0013No.
It order. I must.@0003
@000C@0014It sounds to me like you should leave
the person who gave you that order.@0003
@0009Leave?@0003
@000C@0014@0017Yes!
You can fight with us.@0003
We're protecting the villagers.@0003
@0009@0017...No...
I monster...@0003
People mean to me...
People throw stones...@0003
People say, "Go away!"...
"You a monster!"...@0003
Not human...@0003
@000CThat's horrible!
Of course you're human!@0003
You're a very kind-hearted man.
I can tell.@0003
Please, come with us.
Don't be afraid.@0003
@0009@0013@0017Me afraid? I never afraid! Everyone
afraid of ME! I not afraid!@0003
@000CNo. You ARE afraid.@0003
You're afraid that people will throw
stones and call you a monster.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000CBut you don't have to
be afraid of us.@0003
Everyone in our army is nice. They
won't do that to you.@0003
Be brave... Take that first step, and
you'll never have to be afraid again.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
[E5]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Yeah? What?
You got something to say to me?@0003
@000CI want to ask why you're fighting
against the soldiers.@0003
@0009Who wants to know?@0003
@000CRoy, leader of the
Lycian Army.@0003
We're here on behalf
of Etruria...@0003
@0009You're with Etruria?!@0003
Then you're with the enemy.
Get ready to die!@0003
@000CSlow down!@0003
We're fighting the
castle's troops too.@0003
@0009And yet Etruria sent you?
I don't understand.@0003
@000CI don't either.@0003
We were sent by Etruria to get rid of the
bandits here, but something's strange.@0003
@0009...You say you're fighting
the castle's troops.@0003
I'm for hire, if
you'll take me.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009@0017I'm a seafaring man, so I know both the
land and sea around the Isles.@0003
You look a bit lost, so I could
be a good guide for you.@0003
@000C@0017That would help,
but why?@0003
@0009I want to help with
your mission.@0003
@0017To be honest, I'm a pirate, so I'm probably
the type you were sent to get rid of.@0003
But I only go after the rich. They have
more than their fair share anyway.@0003
@000CWell then, if you'll join us,
we're pleased to have you.@0003
We don't know this area at all,
so it's been difficult thus far.@0003
@0009Sounds like we have a deal!
Leave it to me!@0003@0002
@000C@0011@0006
@0009@0017...This is it, lads.@0003
Can you taste it?
You'll have your vengeance.@0003
And after you do, I might just tag along
with this Roy fellow for a while...@0003
[E6]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0184
@0017I'm worried about Larum.
I hope she's all right.@0003
She smuggled us weapons
so we could defend ourselves.@0003
Even when we begged her to hide,
she refused and kept helping us.@0003@0002
Here's an axe that she brought us.
It's a strange one...@0003
It's strong against swords,
but weak against lances!@0003
I'd gladly trade it for her safety,
though, so please, take it...@0003
[E7]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0188
@0017Brigands and pirates... They were all just as
innocent as anyone when they were young.@0003
Maybe if you spoke to some of them,
you could make them understand.@0003
[E8]
@0010@01E4You made it all the
way here.@0003
But I shall take your
pathetic lives...@0003
[E9]
@0010@01E4@0017...Death?@0003@0002
I feel...my life...
draining...away...@0003
[EA]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Lord Roy...@0003
We couldn't find any evidence
explaining Sir Nord's aggression.@0003
@000CBut now we know for certain
that somebody wants our heads.@0003
@0009I think we should send word to
the mainland about this.@0003
@000CYes, I'll send a message
to General Cecilia.@0003@0009@0011
@0008@0010@0152Excuse me, Lord Roy.@0003
We found a girl imprisoned
in the dungeon.@0003
She wishes to speak with you.@0003
@000CTo me?
Let her pass.@0003
@0008@0012Yes, milord.@0003@0011
@0009@0010@0126@0014@001CYou're Roy?@0003
The one who's here to clear
out the bandits?@001C@0003
@000C@0013Yes, that's me.@0003
@0009@0080@000D@001C@0014I beg you, Roy!
Please rescue my friends!@0003@001C
@000C@0080@000FWhoa, easy there!@0003
@0008@0010@0154@0080@000C@0014Hey!
Get off of him!@0003
@000DC-calm down and
tell me everything.@0003
You say your friends
are in danger?@0003@000A@0011
@000B@0080@000BMy name is Larum.@0003
I'm part of the resistance
force on the Isles.@0003
@000D@0013The force that's fighting
against the bandits?@0003
@0009@0012Yes.@0003
...Actually, no!@0003
@000DNo?@0003
@0009That's part of it,
but the real enemy is Etruria!@0003
They work with the bandits to squeeze every
bit they can out of the people here!@0003
@000D@0080@000EWhat?!
Is that true?!@0003
@0009The lords living here take people into
the mines and work them to death!!@0003
They're allowed no rest, even
if they're sick or injured.@0003
@000C...That's terrible...@0003
@0009@0014We're fighting Etruria
to stop this abuse!@0003
Our next plan was to attack the mine at
Eburacum and rescue the people there!@0003
But...but...!@0003
@000C@0013Calm down!
You can tell me.@0003
@0009A villager here leaked the
details of the plan!@0003
He was probably tortured...@0003
@0009@0014@001CI have to go to the mines before
the resistance is ambushed!@001C@0003
@000CThen there's no time to spare!@0003
We'll help the resistance force and rescue
the people being forced into labor!@0003
@001C@0009@0080@000D@0013@0017Truly, you will?!
Thank you, Roy!@0003@001C
@000C@0080@000F@0014@0017Whoa!
L-Larum!@0003
@0008@0010@0154@0080@000CHey!
I said get off of him!@0003@0011@001C
@000B@0080@000B@0017Here, Roy.
Use this sword.@0003
@000D@0080@000E@0017What is it?@0003
@0009@0017It's called a wyrmslayer.@0003
It's effective against wyvern riders, and
it's said it was used against dragons, too.@0003
Who can say, though?
It might come in handy.@0003
It belongs to Echidna, the leader
of the resistance.@0003
You're helping us though, so you
can have it for now.@0003
[EB]
@0009@0010@0140@000C@0010@012E
@000C@0013@0017@0014So Princess Guinivere isn't
in the Western Isles?@0003
@0009We searched every inch of the Isles,@0003
and our intelligence has learned
nothing from the Lycian Army.@0003
The princess is nowhere to be found.
I apologize.@0003
@000CI understand.
I will continue my search elsewhere.@0003
Bern thanks you for your
cooperation, Father Orlo.@0003
@0009@0017I pray that you find
Princess Guinivere soon.@0003
@000CThank you.@0003@0011
[EC]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0140
@0009@0013Who was that,
Father Orlo?@0003
@000C@0014Captain Melady. A wyvern rider from Bern
who serves Princess Guinivere.@0003
She's searching for the princess.@0003
@0009Did you tell her where
the princess is?@0003
@000COf course not.
Princess Guinivere is far too valuable.@0003
High Chancellor Roartz was ecstatic when
he learned the princess was in Aquileia.@0003
He had the same evil glint in his eye
when Prince Myrddin was assassinated.@0003
@0009Father Orlo!@0003
You must never speak of
the assassination...@0003
@000COh, yes, I must watch my tongue.@0003
Regardless, the princess is secure.@0003
@0009That's reassuring...@0003
@000CSo, why have you
come before me?@0003
Surely not just for
court gossip?@0003
@0009No, milord.@0003
It's regarding the village where the
leader of the resistance hides.@0003
We are prepared to attack,
so I am here for instructions.@0003
@000CWell done.@0003
Commence the attack immediately, before
any unpleasant interruptions arrive...@0003
[ED]
@0009@0010@0126@000B@0010@0102@0017The resistance hideout
is in this village?@0003
@0009Yes, but the castle's troops
may have attacked already.@0003
@000D@0010@0154I must say, that Orlo sounds like a
despicable wretch of a man.@0003
A bishop should preach the words
of the gods to help the people.@0003
But what he's doing is nothing
more than torture!@0003
@001C
@000BIt would be best to wait for
General Cecilia's reply, but...@0003@001C@0009@0011
@0008@0010@0152@0014Lord Roy!@0003
The castle troops are
attacking the village!@0003@0011
@000DOh dear, no!
Lord Roy, should we attack?@0003
@000B@0014I suppose there's no time
to await the reply...@0003
The people here need our help,@0003
even if doing so means souring
our relationship with Etruria...@0003
@000D@0011
@0009@0010@0126Roy...@0003
@000BWe fight!!@0003
Make Lycia proud of our
actions here today!@0003
[EE]
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@0136
@000C@0017Melady, have you discovered
where Princess Guinivere is?@0003
@0009No...@0003
It appears she has left
the Lycian Army.@0003
I thought we were
so close...@0003
@000CIt was a
dead end then.@0003
@0009@0014Galle...
I'm sorry.@0003
King Zephiel wanted to keep the matter
of Princess Guinivere a secret,@0003
so only I was assigned to search
for her.@0003
I'm sorry to get you mixed
up in this...@0003
@000CDon't worry yourself.@0003
@0009But you work directly under General
Murdock. Surely you have other duties.@0003
@000CGeneral Murdock agreed to allow
me to assist you.@0003
If she isn't here, then Princess
Guinivere must be on the mainland.@0003
I'll ask General Narcian for some
additional assistance.@0003
@0009@0013You're going to
bow to Narcian?@0003
@000C@0014Hm?
Of course.@0003
He's one of the three
Wyvern Generals.@0003
He leads the offense on
Lycia and Etruria.@0003
@0009@0013Galle, doesn't that...
frustrate you?@0003
@000C@0012Why should it?@0003
@0009@0014You were to be a Wyvern General.@0003
But Narcian put forth that you're not a Bern
native and took the title for himself.@0003
And you're going to bow down to him
and request his help?@0003
@000C@0013What he said is only the truth...
I wasn't born in Bern.@0003
@0009@0012Still...@0003
@000C@0014I'm pleased with the position
I have now.@0003
The king and General Murdock trust me,
even though I'm not of Bern by birth.@0003
To ask any more would be nothing
but greed.@0003
@0009@0012Galle...@0003
[EF]
@0009@0010@01D7@0017Echidna!
We know you are here!@0003
You are surrounded on
all sides!@0003
Drop your weapons and show
yourself immediately!@0003@0006
[F0]
@000C@0010@0133@0012@0017@0016......@0003
@0009@0010@01D7@0016You are Echidna,
leader of the resistance force?@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@0189@0014Echidna, I'm so sorry! They 
threatened the lives of my family...@0003
@000CI don't blame you.
I'll handle this.@0003
Hurry home to your family now.@0003
@0008@0012I'm sorry...
Truly.@0003@0011
@0009@0010@01D7@0014Surrender peacefully and Father Orlo
may have mercy on you.@0003
@000C@0013@0017I've always been a stubborn wench.
I have no intention of going quietly.@0003
@0009You resist?
Then you leave us no choice!@0003@0002
Take her head!@0003
[F1]
@000C@0010@0140Ha ha ha... I've a
delicious idea... You there!@0003
@0009@0010@01D7@0013@0017Yes, milord?@0003
@000C@0014Tell the brigands the
village is in disarray.@0003
Have them collect all the
money and valuables.@0003
@0009@0013Yes, milord.
But...are you certain of this?@0003
If this becomes public--@0003
@000C@0014You forget that I
speak for the gods.@0003
To accuse me is to oppose
Saint Elimine!@0003
I am immune to persecution!@0003
Hurry. Before the villagers
realize what's happening.@0003
@0009@0012Yes, milord.@0003
[F2]
@000C@0010@0151We can ransack
the village?@0003
@0009@0010@01D7@0017Yes.
But in return...@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, yeah. Take half the
loot to the castle, right?@0003
That bishop in charge of you guys is
a real piece of work, y'know that?@0003
@0009@0013@0017Don't disappoint him.@0003@0011
@000C@0014@0017All right, kids!
Grab your weapons!@0003
Take everything
they got!@0003
[F3]
@0009@0010@0152@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Lord Roy, bandits are approaching
from the mountains in the east.@0003
@000CThey aim to attack the
village in the chaos...@0003
We must stop them and help
the villagers!@0003
[F4]
@0009@0010@0140@000C@0010@01D7
@0009@0017What is taking so long?!@0003
Is the resistance force
so powerful?!@0003
@000CIt's the Lycian Army!@0003
They are supporting the
resistance...@0003
@0009What?!@0003
The Lycian League would
turn against Etruria?@0003
@000CActually, yes. We've just received
a missive from Juteaux!@0003
The Lycian Army is responsible
for the death of Sir Nord.@0003
They are suspected of betraying
Etruria's interests.@0003
They may also have ties with
the bandits.@0003
Lord Arcardo now wants them
dead or alive.@0003
@0009They killed Sir Nord,
you say...?@0003
@0017It seems they finally have just cause
to get rid of the Lycian Army.@0003
Ties with bandits? The Lycian Army?
Oh, the irony...@0003
@000C@0017Lord Arcardo has sent reinforcements
to help capture the Lycian Army.@0003
They should arrive shortly.@0003
@0009@0017He says "capture", but I'm sure he
he intends to kill them.@0003
Let us do the job for him.
Eradicate them!@0003
@000C@0017Yes, milord!@0003
[F5]
@0009@0010@0140@000C@0010@01D7@000CFather Orlo, the reinforcements
will arrive shortly.@0003
@0009I certainly hope it
will be enough.@0003
They are putting up a better
fight than I expected...@0003
[F6]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@0126
@000C@0013Echidna!@0003
@0009@0014Larum?
You're all right?@0003
That puts my mind at ease...@0003
I don't know what I'd say to Elffin
if something happened to you.@0003
@000C@0017I'm sorry... If I hadn't been caught
I could have warned you...@0003
@0009@0017It's fine.
Don't worry.@0003
@000C@0017But...@0003
@0009@0017It wasn't your fault.
Cheer up.@0003
And besides, I'm still in one
piece, so there's that, eh?@0003
@000C@0012@0017...Yeah.@0003
@0009Tell me, what is this
army you're with?@0003
@000CRoy and the Lycian Army!@0003
They came here to defeat
the bandits.@0003
@0009Lycia, huh?@0003
They've come a long
way to get here...@0003
Does it look like they'll
help our cause?@0003
@000C@0013Yes!
They saved me, too.@0003
@0009@0014From the sound of it, I've no
reason NOT to join them.@0003
@000CReally?
That's great!@0003
I'm sure Roy will be
happy too.@0003
[F7]
@0080@0004@0008@0017There are rumors...that Roartz and
Arcardo are working with Bern.@0003
@000C@0080@000DWhat?!
Then Lycia is in danger!@0003
@000D@0010@0154L-Lord Roy!@0003
@0008Your country may be in peril.@0003
Are you free to waste your time
on the Isles as you are?@0003
@000DHe's right!@0003
Bern wanted us out of Lycia so
they could launch an invasion!@0003
We must head back at once!@0003
@000B...We stay here.@0003@001C
@000DWhat?!
Why?!@0003@001C
@0008@0016......@0003@0016
@000BIt's difficult to judge what may
be hearsay and what may be truth.@0003
We can't simply jump on this
rumor and run back to Lycia.@0003
I am certainly concerned, but my father
and General Cecilia are there.@0003
The people on the Isles have only
us to rely on.@0003
@001C
@000DThat may be, but...@0003@001C
@000BIf we leave without finishing our mission,
then all we've done here was for naught.@0003
@0008...Your army is blessed with
a levelheaded leader.@0003
@000BWhat?@0003
@0008Lord Roy, I am sorry for
testing you so.@0003
@000DTesting us?
So that was a lie?!@0003
@0008It was the truth.@0003
However, I presented the rumor in a
way that you might take rash action.@0003
Your leader is a prudent individual.
I would join you if you allow it.@0003
@000B...I don't like that
you tested us.@0003
@0017But if you can help,
I welcome you.@0003
@0017Now, back to the concern we face here.@0003
What can we do to help the
people of the Isles?@0003
@0008We must go to the
capital. To Juteaux.@0003
The people will only be liberated
if the corruption is overthrown.@0003
@000BThen it's settled!
We head for Juteaux!@0003
We fight for the people!
We will defeat the true enemy!@0003
[F8]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0182
Oh! You're the resistance
force, aren't you?@0003
@000CWhat? No?@0003@0002
Ahhh, that explains it...@0003
This is quite a situation
you're in, though...@0003
Here, take this.
We believe in you.@0003
[F9]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0189
@0017I'm supposed to give
this staff to Orlo...@0003
He buys things like this with
the money he takes from us.@0003
But I'll give it to
you instead!@0003
Please end his rule...
We're counting on you.@0003
[FA]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018B
My job is to take the village's
tribute to the castle.@0003
If we don't, the village
will be burnt down.@0003
I'll give the money
to you guys instead!@0003
I'm tired of being stepped
on by this oppressive lord.@0003
I can tell you're different.@0003
[FB]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015C
@000CI have staves for sale
if you want any!@0003
Wait a second.
Have I met you before...?@0003
Ah, probably just my
imagination...@0003
Anyway, how many staves
do you want?@0003
@0017They work really well. They cure
conditions instead of health.@0003@0002
You don't want any?! Darn!@0003
I'll give you a sample,
so buy one next time!@0003
[FC]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018C@000CTake this!
I want to help in any way I can.@0003
It's a speedwing!@0003
@000CUse it and you'll
become a little faster!@0003
[FD]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0188
@000C@0017It's so difficult
under Orlo's rule...@0003
He takes everything from us,
even our hopes and dreams...@0003
Please, take this.
I hope it helps.@0003
[FE]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0183
@000CGood luck to you!
We can't even touch these guys.@0003
@000CSome people in your army
can use bows, can't they?@0003
@000CThis should be helpful.@0003
@000CI know it's not much...
but I want you to have it.@0003
[FF]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0185
@0017This dusty old lance?@0003
I'll give it to you to use against
the villains here.@0003
@000CMy foolish brother wielded this
before he died.@0003
@000C@0017He was a terrible fighter, but he
believed his cause was just.@0003
@000CThat's what got him killed...@0003@0002
@000C@0017He was so very foolish...@0003
[0100]
@0010@0140@0017Opposing me...is the equivalent
of opposing the gods!@0003@0002
I shall rain divine punishment
upon you!@0003
[0101]
@0010@0140@0017You...heathens...
...I represent the gods...@0003
[0102]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Lord Roy, there is a young man claiming
to be with the resistance here.@0003
@000C@0017I'll see him.
Let him pass.@0003@0009@0011
@0008@0010@012BI am pleased to meet you.
My name is Elffin.@0003
I am a member of the
resistance force.@0003
@000CI am Roy of the
Lycian Army.@0003
@0008You have my thanks for
saving our village here.@0003
@000CWe simply did what
we believe is right.@0003
@0008@0017But now you stand
against Etruria.@0003
@000CEven so, I have
no regrets.@0003
We may have opposed Etruria's
immediate interests,@0003
but once the truth about the Isles is
out, I'm certain they will understand.@0003
I sent a letter to a trustworthy
Etrurian noble.@0003
If she takes appropriate measures,
they will send us aid.@0003
@0008I would not
be so sure...@0003
@000CWhy is that?@0003
@0008Don't you find it odd that Etruria
requested your help here at all?@0003
@000CActually...yes, I do.@0003
@0008If I may be so bold as to guess...@0003
Was it High Chancellor Roartz and
Lord Arcardo who requested your help?@0003
@000C...It was.@0003
@0008There may have been ulterior motives for
sending your army away.@0003
Perhaps your presence in Lycia was
undesirable to them.@0003
@000CI never even
considered that...@0003
[0103]
@0009@0010@0182@000C@0010@0102
@0009Are you General Roy?@0003
@000CYes, I am.@0003
@0009You saved our village.
We owe you our livelihoods.@0003
Please, take this as a token
of our gratitude.@0003
[0104]
@0009@0010@0146@000C@0010@013F
@0009@0080@000B@0017S-S...
Sir Flaer!@0003
@000C@0017Lord Arcardo.
Why do you fret so?@0003
@0009@0080@000B@0017It's the Lycian Army!
They come for my blood!@0003
@000C@0017
Yes, they have been a thorn
in Bern's side for some time...@0003
We knew it would be difficult if they
became too close with Etruria.@0003
That's why we had you send them here.
Ending them should have been simple.@0003
It seems, however, they fight
even better than expected.@0003
@0009@0080@000B@0017You don't understand the gravity
of this situation!@0003
Do you realize how much I've
lost thanks to their meddling?@0003
All the riches I've reaped
from these islands are gone!@0003
...And on top of that,
now they want my life!@0003
Once they arrive, my legacy
is finished!@0003
My hands are shaking.
I don't know what to do...@0003
@000C@0017My, how you worry.@0003
I suggest you flee to the mainland.
To Etruria.@0003
@0009@0013@0017You will allow it?@0003
@000C@0014@0017Warfare is Bern's strong suit.@0003
We also have our secret
weapon ready to brandish.@0003
With it we shall erase the
Lycian Army once and for all.@0003
@0009@0012@0017But...@0003
@000C@0014@0017Lord Arcardo.@0003
Once Bern and Etruria join forces,
we will have no reason to fear anyone.@0003
Am I wrong?@0003
@0009@0013No... No!
You're right.@0003
I leave them to you.@0003@0011
[0105]
@000C@0010@013F@0017Hmph, cowardly Etrurian nobles.@0003
If we defeat the Lycian Army here,
the Isles shall be ours...@0003
[0106]
@000C@0010@0102@0017This is the capital...@0003
Once we take it,
we can finally go home.@0003
@0009@0010@012BLord Roy,@0003
I have heard some troubling rumors
from the people living around here.@0003
They say an "unhuman"
resides in the castle.@0003
@000CWhat does that mean?@0003
@0009They say there is a man who
changes form...into a dragon.@0003
@000C@0080@000DA man?
Who turns into a dragon?@0003
@0009I can say nothing more at this point,
but we must proceed with caution.@0003
[0107]
@000B@0010@0102@0017This is the capital...@0003
@0017Once we take it,
we can finally go home.@0003
@001C@000D@0010@012B@0017I have already sent someone
in to unlock the gate...@0003@0008@0010@0126
@000DOh, there she is.@0003@001C
@000BThe one over there
dressed like a dancer?@0003
@001C@000DYes, that's her.@0003@001C
@0008@0017Your Highness!
@0080@000AOver@0080@000A here!@0003
@000B@0017Your Highness?@0003
@001C@000D...I know not of
what she speaks.@0003
@0008@0080@000C@0017Your Highness!
You're late.@0003
@000D@0017Larum, why do you call
me "Your Highness"?@0003@001C
@000AHuh? ...Oh!
Ah...er...@0003
@000A@0080@000B@0017Well, you know, you look like
royalty, so it's your nickname!@0003
@001C@000D@0016......@0003@001C
@000B......@0003@0016
@001C@000D@0017
My apologies, Lord Roy.@0003
This is Larum, a member
of the resistance.@0003@001C
@0009@0017You're Roy?@0003
Everyone on the Isles
has heard of you!@0003
They all call you the
Savior from the East.@0003
@0009@0080@000CNice to meet you!
I'm Larum.@0003
@000B@0080@000D@0017Whoa!
Please leave a little distance!@0003
@000A@0017Roy, your face is all red.
How cute!!@0003@001C
@000D@0017...Larum...@0003@001C
@000A@0080@000BOh! R-right...
There's something I should tell you.@0003
I've been hearing strange rumors.@0003
The people here say that an
"unhuman" resides in this castle.@0003
@000BAn "unhuman"...?@0003
@0009Oh, yes.@0003
They say he changes form into
something that looks like a dragon!@0003
@000BA human?
That can change into a dragon?!@0003
@0009I don't know...
but that's what I hear.@0003
@001C@000DWe must proceed
with caution.@0003@001C
[0108]
@0009@0010@0141@000C@0010@013FAh, there
you are, Ein.@0003
@0009@0013@0017You called...?@0003
@000C@0014I will make a report about the
Lycian Army to General Narcian.@0003
I want you to defend the castle
while I am away.@0003
@0009@0012...Understood.@0003
@000C@0013Hm?
Who's there?!@0003@0002@0005
@0016......@0003
@0016Just the wind...?@0003@0005@0002
Ahem. I will take my leave now.
I leave them to your discretion.@0003
@0009@0012...Understood.@0003@0011
@000C@0014Ha ha... The Lycian Army will hardly be
able to stand against this dragon.@0003
Normal weapons won't even scratch
its skin.@0003
These manaketes...
They certainly are terrifying beasts.@0003
[0109]
@000C@0010@0125...So that's what
the "unhuman" is.@0003
Bern really has brought
dragons into this world.@0003
...What to do now...?@0003
@0017I guess I'll pose as a soldier
and observe the dragon's power.@0003
[010A]
@000C@0010@012CLa la la la la,@0005
la la la la la...@0003
All the way out here
in the Isles West,@0003
folks work to death for
nobles in their nest!@0003@0002
This castle's sure to be
brimming with treasure!@0003
All this loot was stolen
anyway.@0003
Might as well take it off
these nobles' hands.@0003
[010B]
@0009@0010@0141@000C@0010@01D7The reinforcements from the
south will arrive shortly!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016...Th-that's all, sir.@0003@0002
@0009@0011@0005@000CThat guy gives
me chills...@0003
[010C]
@000C@0010@01D7@0017Did you handle the cave on
the outskirts of town?@0003
@0009@0010@01DBYes, sir.@0003
The bandits have blocked
off all entrance to it.@0003
No one will be able to get to
the legendary weapon now.@0003
@000CExcellent!@0003
Now all we have to do is
clean up the Lycian Army.@0003
[010D]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0121
@000C@0013Raigh? Raigh!
It's so good to see you!@0003
@0009@0017Lugh...!
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0014@0017I'm glad you're OK.
We were all worried about you.@0003
I know you wanted to train your magic
skills, but you left so suddenly.@0003
@0009I couldn't have learned magic if
I'd stayed in that orphanage.@0003
It was a miracle I picked
up as much as I did.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Raigh...
The orphanage is gone.@0003
@0009@0014What?
What happened?@0003
@000CBern came...and
burned it down.@0003
@0009...What happened to everybody?@0003
@000CPoppa was killed
trying to protect us...@0003
The young children are under the
care of the St. Elimine Church now.@0003
@0009...I see.
It's for the best...@0003
They'll be happier at the church
than at that dilapidated orphanage.@0003
@000CYou don't have to be
so callous about it.@0003
@0009@0016@0012......@0003
@000C@0016@0014Raigh!
Come with us.@0003
We'll defeat Bern, and then we
can go back to the children!@0003
@0009Sorry,
not interested.@0003
@000CBut--@0003
@0009@0014@0017Then again...the Lycian Army
might be good company.@0003
They're sure to come across
more dragons at some point.@0003
All right, you got me.
I suppose I'll go with you.@0003
@000C@0012Raigh...@0003
@0009@0014@0017I just want you to
know one thing.@0003
I'm not joining to avenge
Poppa or the orphanage!@0003
@000C@0013@0017I know, Raigh.@0003
@0009@0014@0017Then stop looking
at me like that!@0003
[010E]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0111
@000C@0017Raigh!
What are you doing here?@0003
@0009My thoughts exactly, Chad.
What happened to the orphanage?@0003
@000C@0013...I knew you'd be concerned.@0003
You ran off, but I knew
you'd never forget us.@0003
@0009@0014I was never concerned.
I was just curious.@0003
@000C@0013...The orphanage is gone.@0003
@0009What do you mean?@0003
@000C@0014Bern's troops burned it to the
ground when they invaded Lycia.@0003
Poppa... He couldn't...@0003
@0009@0013What?!
They killed Poppa...?@0003
@000C@0014I'm going to avenge him.@0003
We're stuck on these Isles now.@0003
But I know we'll go back and fight
Bern full force some day...!@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CI suppose there's no point in
telling you, though, is there?@0003
@0009...I'll go with you.@0003
@000C@0013What?!
Are you serious?@0003
@0009@0014@0017Bern has a deep connection
with the dragons.@0003
I want to learn more.@0003
@000C@0012...So that's it.
Fine.@0003
Just don't get
in my way.@0003
[010F]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0121
@000C@0013Raigh? Raigh!
It's so good to see you!@0003
@0009@0017Lugh...!
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0014@0017I'm glad you're OK.
We were all worried about you.@0003
I know you wanted to train your magic
skills, but you left so suddenly.@0003
@0009I couldn't have learned magic if
I'd stayed in that orphanage.@0003
It was a miracle I picked
up as much as I did.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Raigh...
The orphanage is gone.@0003
@0009@0014I know. I heard from Chad
just a moment ago.@0003
@000CReally?@0003
@0009Yes. In fact, I've joined up
with this army you're in.@0003
@000CYou have?!@0003
@0009I just want you to
know one thing.@0003
I'm not here to avenge
Poppa or the orphanage!@0003
@000C@0013@0017I know, Raigh.@0003
@0009@0014@0017Then stop looking
at me like that!@0003
[0110]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0111
@000C@0017Raigh!
What are you doing here?@0003
@0009My thoughts exactly, Chad.@0003@0002
I heard from Lugh about
the orphanage.@0003
@000C@0013...And what did you
think about that?@0003
@0009@0014Nothing in particular.@0003
@000C@0013...So you say.@0003
@0009I've joined up with
your army, by the way.@0003
I want to learn more
about these dragons.@0003
@000C...Of course you do. Fine.@0003
But I'm here to avenge Poppa.
Just don't get in my way.@0003
[0111]
@0010@0141@0017...Burn.@0003
[0112]
@0010@0141@0017...What...?!@0003
[0113]
@000B@0010@0102@0013@0017That was not an easy battle...@0003
The dragons' power is truly...
horrific.@0003
@0009@0010@012BAn unhuman...
Now I understand.@0003@001C
@000BHow many of these dragons
does Bern have...?@0003
How can we expect to be victorious
against monsters like these?!@0003
@0009Lord Roy!
Keep a level head.@0003
@000BAh...@0003
@0009...I understand your worries.@0003
But if you panic, that feeling
will spread to the army.@0003
You must remember that.@0003
@000B@0080@000E...I'm sorry.@0003
@0009It is a perfectly understandable
reaction after a fight like that.@0003
But...we also gained knowledge
we did not have before.@0003
@000CWhat knowledge
is that?@0003
@0009Don't you remember?@0003
I told you Arcardo was rumored
to be working with Bern.@0003
@000COh, that's right!@0003
If Bern's dragons are in
an Etrurian castle...@0003
@0009Arcardo has indeed made
a deal with Bern.@0003
@000C...That means Lycia is in danger...@0003
We must return to the mainland.@0003
We have to contact General
Cecilia and conceive a plan...@0003
[0114]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Lord Roy, before returning to the mainland,
there is a matter to take care of.@0003
@000CMore bandits?@0003
@0009No, thankfully.@0003
A legendary weapon is hidden
in a cave not far from here.@0003
If we obtain it, we can fight
the dragons more effectively.@0003
@000CA legendary weapon... You're right!@0003
If we can get all eight of them, we
might have a chance of defeating Bern!@0003
@0009Yes... We must find as
many as we can.@0003
@000CThen let's go to the
cave and get it!@0003
[0115]
@0008@0010@0152@000B@0010@0102
@0008@0017R-report!
I have a message from Etruria...@0003
A revolution has broken out in
Aquileia, capital of Etruria.@0003@001C
@000D@0010@0154@0013What?!@0003@001C
@0008@0014The ones leading the revolution are
High Chancellor Roartz and Lord Arcardo.@0003
They have captured King Mordred.@0003
They also say they plan to divide dominion
of the continent between Bern and Etruria!@0003@001C
@000DThe two strongest nations
in Elibe joining forces...@0003
@001C
@000BIs General Cecilia all right?!
And what of Princess Guinivere...@0003
@0008We don't have any
current information...@0003
But the three Etrurian Generals have
parted ways and are working separately.@0003
Mage General Cecilia has fled Aquileia for
the Missur Peninsula in the southwest.@0003
@000BAnd the other Generals?@0003
@0008They're with the revolutionaries against their
will because the king was taken hostage.@0003@001C
@000D@0012Lord Roy...@0003@001C
@000B@0013We need to contact
General Cecilia...@0003@0002
Princess Guinivere...
Please be safe...@0003
[0116]
@0009@0010@013F@000C@0010@0142
@000C@0013@0017You haven't taken
the castle yet?!@0003
@0009@0014The loyalists led by General
Cecilia fight harder than anticipated...@0003@0011
@000CCecilia...!
That woman!@0003
She interferes in my
work yet again!@0003
[0117]
@000C@0010@0142@000A@0010@0149
@000A@0017You seem to be having trouble,
Narcian.@0003
@0008@001C@0010@014B@0016......@0016@0003
@0008@0011
@000CY-Your Majesty?!
When...did you arrive?@0003
@000A@0014Just this moment.@0003
The general from Etruria
fights well, I see.@0003
@000C@0013Yes, Your Majesty...@0003
But everything will soon
be under our control.@0003
@000A@0014Allow me.
I will squash her myself.@0003
@000C@0011@0008@0010@014B@0013Your Majesty, there
is no need...@0003@001C
@000A@0014These arms could use some exercise.
It's no bother.@0003
@0008@0011@001C@000C@0010@0142
@000A@0014Bring me to her,
Narcian.@0003
[0118]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0012@0017What's the latest?@0003
@0009@0014The castle has yet
to fall, Lord Roy.@0003
@000C@0013Good!
We still have time.@0003
[0119]
@000C@0010@0134@000A@0010@0149
@000A@0017So you are Cecilia,
Mage General of Etruria.@0003
@000C@0012...King Zephiel...@0003
@000A@0014You fight well. I reward you
with the honor of dueling me.@0003
@000C@0013@0016......@0003
[011A]
@0010@0134@0017You're too...
powerful...@0006@0003
[011B]
@000A@0010@0149@0017She lost consciousness...
How disappointing. I expected more.@0003
@0008@0010@0142@0013@0017Your Majesty!
Untouchable as always!@0003@001C
@000A@0014@0017I suppose it was foolish to expect
a challenge from an Etrurian.@0003
@0008@0011@000C@0010@0142@0017If you would allow it, Your Majesty,
will you leave her to me?@0003
@000A@0012@0017Why?@0003
@000C@0014@0017She has caused me...
certain difficulties.@0003
I want to see that she
suffers for them.@0003
@000A@0013@0017Hmph. Very well.
Do as you wish.@0003@0011
@000C@0014@0017Thank you, Your Majesty.@0003@0002
You! Ready a cell in the dungeon!@0003
@0008@0010@01D7Yes, General Narcian.@0003
[011C]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@011A@0017Bern has attacked
the castle?@0003
@0009Yes, sir.@0003
@000C...This wasn't in the agreement.@0003
They promised to leave Etrurian
matters to us of Etruria.@0003
@0009What shall we do?@0003
@000CWas it General Narcian who made
the order to attack the castle?@0003
@0009No, sir.
It was King Zephiel himself.@0003
@000CReally!@0004
The king himself...@0003
@0009@0011@000CThen Bern never saw us as
partners to begin with.@0003
@0009@0010@01D7@000CWe will observe for now
and fall back in time.@0003
@0009Yes, sir!@0003@0011
@000C@0016......@0003
[011D]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0013@0017The castle has fallen?@0003
@0009Yes...
We were too late.@0003
@000CIs General Cecilia
all right?@0003
@0009@0014There's no report of her
death, but it looks grim...@0003
@000CThere's still a possibility
that she's alive.@0003
We can't give up on her.
We must hurry!@0003
[011E]
@000B@0010@0149@0008@0010@0142
@0008@0017Your Majesty!
We have found Princess Guinivere.@0003
@000B@0013Bring her before me.@0003
[011F]
@000B@0010@0149@0009@0010@0157@0017My brother...@0003
@000B@0013Guinivere.
So good to see you.@0003@0080@0004
@0009@0014Zephiel, why?@0003
Why do you continue this war?
So many innocent people have died...@0003
@000BInnocent, you say?@0003
Pah. Jealousy, vanity, greed...@0003
Men kill because of these petty
emotions all across the realm.@0003
How can you say they
are innocent?@0003
@0009@0012I...@0003
@000B@0014The world must be liberated from
these trivial creations of man.@0003
That is the purpose of this war.@0003
@0009But...so many people are being
killed in the process.@0003
@000BA few worthless lives are a fair
trade for the change I desire.@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0012Zephiel...!@0003
@000B@0014Guinivere, you are my only sister.
My only surviving blood relative.@0003
As such, I forgive you this time,
but I shan't the next.@0003
You would do well to
remember that.@0003
@0008@0012@0016......@0016@0003@0080@0004
@000B@0014Narcian!@0003
Is the head of Guinivere's
guard present?@0003
@000A@0010@0142Yes, Your Majesty.
Melady is here.@0003
@000BGood.@0003
Have her take Guinivere back to Bern.@0003
Also have her ensure the Fire Emblem
is returned to the Shrine of Seals.@0003
@000A@0012Of course, Your Majesty.@0003@0011
@0008Zephiel...@0003
[0120]
@000C@0010@0157@0009@0010@012E
@000C@0012@0017Melady...@0003
@0009@0014@0017Your Highness, I am pleased
to see you safe. @0003
@0009@0080@000C@0013Now, let us return
to Bern...@0003
@0012@0017Your Highness?@0003
@000C@0080@000FMelady!@0003
@000A@0014W-what are you doing?!@0003
Put that sword down before
you hurt yourself!@0003
@000D@0013Let me free,
Melady!@0003
@000A@0012What?!@0003
@0014...And what will Your Highness
do if she is freed?@0003
@000D@0014...I understand that Roy and the
Lycian Army are nearby...@0003
@000A@0013You would join the enemy?!@0003
@000D@0014I cannot sit idly by and watch as the
world is overrun by Bern's forces...@0003
No matter the reason, it is
senselessly violent conquest.@0003
What kind of future will this war
lead us to...?@0003
@000A@0012@0016......@0003
@000D@0014@0016Melady,
I ask you to let me go.@0003
@000A@0012...There is just...@0003
@000DYes?@0003
@000A@0014There is just one thing I
wish to ask, Your Highness.@0003
When you left Bern, why did you
not ask my opinion...?@0003
@000D@0080@000E@0013I thought involving you would
damage your reputation.@0003
I didn't want you to be branded
a traitor like me.@0003
@000A@0014
Does Your Highness honestly think
I would ever pay any heed to that?@0003
I serve Your Highness before I
serve Bern.@0003
It has been so since I was
knighted.@0003
@000C@0012Melady...@0003
@000A@0014@0017
If you tell me to let you go,
then with pleasure, I will.@0003
I ask only one favor of you.@0003
Allow me to accompany you.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0013Melady...
Thank you...@0003
[0121]
@000B@0010@0102
@0008@0010@012E@0013@0017Please lower your weapons!
I am not an enemy!@0003
@000BWhat?
Soldiers, let her through!@0003
@0008@0011@001C@000D@0010@0154Lord Roy,
it may be a trick...@0003@001C
@000B@0014She may be a messenger.@0003
@001C@000D@0016@0012......@0003@0011@001C
@0008@0010@012E@0016@0013Are you General Roy?@0003
@000B...Yes.
And you are?@0003
@0008@0011@0009@0010@0157@0012Roy!@0003
@000B@0013Princess Guinivere?!@0003
@0017You're unharmed!@0003
@0009Yes... I escaped
with her assistance.@0003@0011
@0008@0010@012EMy name is Melady.
It is a pleasure to meet you.@0003
@0011
@0009@0010@0157@0014Roy,
General Cecilia is alive.@0003
@000B@0013R-really?@0003
@0009Yes, truly.@0003
She is gravely wounded,
but she is alive.@0003
She is locked in a cell
in the castle.@0003
@000B@0014@0017Thank you!
We have to rescue her!@0003
[0122]
@0008@0010@014B@000B@0010@0149
@000B@0013@0017Are they ready?@0003
@0008Yes, the dragons are prepared
to fight at your command.@0003@0011
@000B@0014Narcian.@0003@0009@0010@0142
@000BI will give you some dragons
to fortify your legion.@0003
I want you to go with your troops
to Nabata after cleaning up here.@0003
@0009Nabata?@0003
The desert lands to
the east of here?@0003
@000BCorrect. There is tell of a
hidden village in the desert.@0003
Dragons have supposedly been
living there since the Scouring.@0003
@0009Ah, now I understand... A legendary
weapon is likely hidden there.@0003
@000BPrecisely.
It must not fall into enemy hands.@0003
I sent some men in already,
but they seem to be outnumbered.@0003
@0009@0017Leave it to me, Your Majesty.
The village shall be ours.@0003
@000B@0017...I trust that it will.
Do not disappoint me.@0003
@0009@0012You can rest easy,
Your Majesty!@0003
By my honor as Wyvern General,
I will not fail you!@0003
[0123]
@000D@0010@0134
@0013@0017...Oh...
Where am I...?@0080@000F@0003
@0008@0010@012DYou're not well yet...
You mustn't move...@0003
@000DDid you treat my wounds?@0003
@0008@0014Yes... I'm not an
expert, however...@0003
My work may leave something
to be desired...@0003
@000DNo, it's fine.
Thank you.@0003
We must find a way
out of here...@0003
...Ow...!@0003
@0008@0080@000BDon't move...
Your wound will open...@0003
@000D@0013But I must do something...@0003
@0009@0014Everything will
be fine...@0003
I see a light...
It will arrive shortly...@0003
@000D@0012A light?@0003
@0009@0014Yes...
A light that will aid us...@0003
We must wait patiently...@0003
@000D@0013Who are you...?@0003
@0009@0014I am Sophia...
A shaman of Arcadia...@0003
@000D@0012What is Arcadia?@0003
@0009@0014I will tell you more later...
For now, please just trust me...@0003
[0124]
@0009@0010@013F@000C@0010@0142
@0009@0017General Narcian!
It's them!@0003
The Lycian Army!@0003
@000CWhat?!
Flaer, you cad!@0003
I thought you took care
of them at Juteaux!@0003
@0009I did!@0003
Well...I left a dragon to
deal with them...@0003
I never thought they
would survive!@0003
@000CDisregarding your failure,
my reputation is at stake!@0003
They defeated a dragon, so they
must be more hardy than I expected.@0003
Yet if I can't defeat them here,
people will doubt my ability...@0003
@0009General Narcian...
What should we do...?@0003
@000CThere is only one thing we CAN do...
Flaer.@0003
I will return to Aquileia and
prepare to face the Lycian Army.@0003
You stay here.@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0013What?!@0003
M-me...?
Stay here?@0003
@000CDon't worry.
I don't expect you to defeat them.@0003
All I want is for you to hit them as
hard as you can and soften them up a bit.@0003
@0008General Narcian!
You intend to use me as fodder?!@0003
@000C@0014@0017Flaer...@0003
In truth, your failure in the Western Isles
is grounds for execution.@0003
I am giving you one last chance to prove
that you aren't a complete failure.@0003
You should be thanking me, if anything.@0003@0016
Hm@0005 hm@0005 hm...@0003@0016
@0008@0012@0017But...!@0003
@000C@0080@000DI can personally execute
you now if you prefer.@0003
@0008@0016......@0003@0016
Yes...sir...
I understand.@0003
@000B@0017Good.
Then I bid you adieu.@0003@0011
[0125]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@01D7@0017Yes,
General Perceval?@0003
@0009We're leaving.@0003
@000CWhat?
Are you sure?@0003
@0009Bern's actions are an
insult to Etruria.@0003
I cannot aid Bern any further.
We must return to Aquileia.@0003
I will inform General Douglas of this
and plan a new course of action.@0003
Fall back at once!@0003
@000CYes, sir!@0003
[0126]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0165
Here, take this ring.@0003
It will build up your
muscles when you use it.@0003
...It might make the ladies a
little less attractive, though.@0003
[0127]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0164
I thought I'd try to defend
myself with this sword,@0003
but I don't know how to use it.@0003
It's a nice sword though,
isn't it?@0003
The last one to use it was a kid
named Al.@0003
He was a courageous one, and he
stood up to Bern, just like you.@0003
Here. I'll give it to you.
Use it to end this war!@0003
[0128]

[0129]

[012A]

[012B]

[012C]

[012D]

[012E]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0166
Cecilia, Perceval, and Douglas!
They're the three Etrurian Generals.@0003
Even the three Wyvern Generals
of Bern are no match for them.@0003
...That's what I'd like
to think, anyway.@0003
[012F]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0164
@0017General Cecilia...
She was defeated in one blow...@0003
King Zephiel is more powerful than
any of us could have imagined...@0003
[0130]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015C
General Perceval still swears loyalty to
Prince Myrddin even after his passing.@0003
Loyal and hard-working to the end.
That's what I call a real man...@0003
[0131]
@0010@013FYou've made it...@0003@0002
But I am a knight of Bern!
I will not surrender!@0003
[0132]
@0010@013FI may fall, but Bern
cannot be stopped...@0003
Your defeat is
inevitable...@0003
Be sure of it...@0003
[0133]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0013@0017General Cecilia!@0003
@0009Roy... I failed.
I'm so ashamed.@0003
@000CThe important thing is
that you are alive...@0003
But how are your wounds?
Are you all right?@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@012D@000A@0010@0134
@000A@0014@0017Yes, I'm fine.
This girl treated them for me.@0003
@000C@0012@0017Who is she?@0003@001C
@0008@0013I am Sophia...
A shaman of Arcadia...@0003@001C
@000A@0017She foresaw your coming.@0003
She also said she would explain
her story once we had time.@0003
@0011@0080@0004
@0008@0014@0017Yes, now is fine...@0003
Arcadia, my home, lies to the east
in the Nabata desert...@0003
We have always kept hidden...but Bern
discovered our existence...and...@0003
@000C@0013They attacked?@0003
@0008@0014Yes...@0003
I...was too slow to act,
so I was captured...@0003
@000CWhy would Bern attack a
small village like yours?@0003
@0008I do not know...@0003
Perhaps they learned of the
dragons that live in Arcadia...@0003
@000C@0080@000DDragons?!@0003
@0008That's right...@0003
Arcadia was founded by both
dragon and man ages ago...@0003
@000B@0013...I never knew such a
place existed...@0003
@0008Lord Roy...
Please, save our village...@0003
@000D@0010@0154@0014Her story seems too
fantastic to be true.@0003
@0008@0016@0012......@0003
@000D@0011@000B@0016@0014
Dragons or no, I believe her when she
says Bern attacked her village.@0003
Sophia, we are in your debt for
saving General Cecilia.@0003
We owe it to you to do what we
can to save your village.@0003
@0008...Thank you...@0003
@000BCan you tell me more
about this Arcadia?@0003
And the dragons?@0003
@0008...Yes... I will gladly tell
you all that I know...@0003
[0134]
@0009@0010@01DC@000C@0010@011A
@0009@0017General Perceval, we will station
ourselves at this castle.@0003
We shall prepare for further attacks
from the revolutionaries.@0003
@000CYes, please do.@0003
@0009We found this in the castle.
Please take it.@0003@0002
General Perceval, please...
Save Etruria.@0003
@000CI will.
Count on it.@0003
@0009Yes, sir!@0003
[0135]
@000A@0010@011B@000D@0010@0104
@000A@0013@0017Hurry, Fae!@0003
Follow this path and
find a place to hide.@0003
Can you make it?@0003
@000D@0080@000FI'm...
I'm tired!@0003
@000A@0014Now is no time for
complaints.@0003
Go, or Bern's soldiers
will find us.@0003
@000D@0013What happened
to Sophia?@0003
@000A@0014I don't know...@0003
She may have been captured
by Bern's troops.@0003
@000DBut if Bern catches us, then
we can see the outside world!@0003
@000AFae, no.@0003
The elder strictly forbids
communication with the outside world.@0003
@000D@0080@000F@0012Aw...
Please?@0003
@000A@0014No.@0003
...I do wonder how Bern found
out about our village, however...@0003
Perhaps it is related to the ominous
force Sophia detected in the soldiers...@0003
@000DWhat?@0003
@000AAh, sorry!@0003
Now is not the time
for that!@0003
Fae! Over here!
Hurry!@0003
@000D@0013...I want to see the
outside world, too.@0003
[0136]
@000C@0010@01C9@0009@0010@012A
@000C@0017Zeiss!
Has General Narcian arrived yet?@0003
@0009He sent some sellswords and dragons,
but the general himself isn't here.@0003
@000CWhat on earth is he thinking?@0003
How does he expect these sparse troops
to tip the odds in our favor...?@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000C@0014King Zephiel must be notified about
the dragons living here.@0003
Zeiss, go to Aquileia and make
a report to His Majesty.@0003
@0009@0013What should I say?@0003
@000C@0014Tell him that dragons do indeed inhabit
this village.@0003
A captive tells us there are even divine
dragons, the most powerful of all.@0003
...Go quickly.@0003
@0009@0012Yes, sir.@0003
[0137]
@0008@0010@012D@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0013@0017This is a fierce sandstorm.@0003
@0008@0014Yes... These sandstorms have always
protected our village from intruders.@0003
@000CI can imagine that most who wander into
this mess would give up quickly.@0003
I can barely see an arm's length ahead...@0003
In which direction do we move?@0003
@0008Head to the northeast...
But...@0003
@000C@0012Yes?@0003
@0008@0014There may be objects covered by the
sand, blown about by the storm...@0003
Please watch your step...@0003
[0138]
@0008@0010@01D2@000D@0010@01D1
@0017Maggie, my sweet, did you see that
group heading right into the desert?@0003
@0008Yes, Rose, I most certainly did.@0003
@000D@0080@000D
They must be headed for the hidden
village said to be near here, Maggie.@0003
@0008@0080@000CBless my soul, Rose.
I believe you may be correct.@0003
@000B@0080@000EBut my sweet Maggie, we wouldn't want to
get lost in the sandstorm, would we?@0003
@000A@0080@000BOf course not, Rose.@0003
Then we wouldn't be able to
find our way home.@0003
@000C@0080@000FDo you think we should give up
on the village then, Maggie?@0003
@0009@0080@000AMy dear Rose, you forget the rumors say
there is great treasure in the village.@0003
@000D@0080@000DWell, we certainly wouldn't want to
miss out on that, would we, Maggie?@0003
@0008@0080@000COf course not, Rose.@0003
It would make us far richer than
ambushing travelers has.@0003@001C
@000B@0080@000FBut I don't want to
get lost, Maggie.@0003@001C
@000A@0080@000AMy dear Rose, hear me out.@0003
We need only follow closely behind the
group we saw heading into the desert.@0003
That will ensure they lead us right
to the village.@0003
@001C
@000DWhat a wonderful idea, Maggie.@0003
And once we reach the village, we can
thank them by mashing their heads in.@0003
@0008Marvelous, my dear Rose.@0003
@001C
@000D@0080@000DLet's be off then.
Shall we, Maggie?@0003
@0008@0080@000C@0013Why certainly,
my dear Rose.@0003@001C
@000BThen let's waste no time,
my sweet Maggie.@0003
[0139]
@000C@0010@0102@0013@0017The sandstorm...
It stopped.@0003
@000A@0010@0154@0014This is our chance, Lord Roy!
The village is in clear sight now!@0003
@000CBut it is to the enemy, too.
We must hurry!@0003
[013A]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@01C9
@0009@0017Sir Randy, we have finished
searching the village.@0003
@000C@0013Did you find the
legendary weapon?@0003
@0009@0014No...@0003
But we destroyed all the passageways
we suspected might lead to it.@0003
@000CGood work.@0003
Now all that's left is to
stop the Lycian Army.@0003
[013B]
@0009@0010@012D
Something...is glittering
in the sand...@0005 Oh...@0003@0002
What a beautiful ring...@0003
[013C]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0161
Have you heard of the sky god, Delphi?@0003
He is said to race through the skies
and protect all living things.@0003
They say that with his blessing,@0003
wyvern riders and pegasus knights
can fly freely without danger...@0003
[013D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0173
There are a lot of things
buried in the sand.@0003
If you're really lucky, you might
find something good.@0003
Try looking around the bones.@0003
[013E]
@0010@01D1@0017Dear me, Maggie...
This hurts, doesn't it?@0003
[013F]
@0010@01D2@0017Oh my, Rose...
I've never known such pain.@0003
[0140]
@0010@01C9
My sword is unmatchable.
Choose your death.@0003
Will you die by the blade...
or by its light?@0003
[0141]
@0010@01C9
You're so strong...
I'm impressed...@0003
It's an honor to die
by your hand...@0003
[0142]
@000D@0010@012D@000B@0010@0102
@000B@0017That was a difficult battle...
but we won.@0003
Sophia, where are
the villagers?@0003@0002
Sophia, are you OK?
What's wrong?@0003@001C
@000D...The entrance to the temple...@0003@001C
@000BThis door...?@0003
It looks like it's been
forced open.@0003
What lies inside the temple?@0003
@001C
@000DSomething we call a
legendary weapon...@0003
It is a spell tome...@0003@001C
@000BA legendary weapon?!
There's one here, too?!@0003
...That must be
what Bern was after!@0003
Are we too late?@0003
@001C
@000DIt is still here...
I can sense it...@0003@001C
@000B@0011@000A@0010@0102@0013All right!
Then let's get it!@0003@0002
We may still be able
to stop Bern!@0003
[0143]
@000A@0010@016E@0013@0017Who trespasses in this place?
What is your business here?@0003
@000C@0010@0102@0014My name is Roy.@0003
Sophia brought me here. I came
to protect the village.@0003
@000A@0013Sophia...?@0003
Then it was you who drove
off Bern's soldiers?@0003
Oh dear...
Please forgive me.@0003
I am the elder of Arcadia.@0003
@000CThe elder...
Are you a dragon?@0003
@000AA dragon... I have
been called that before.@0003
But that was a time
long past.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@000A@0014Let me think...@0003
Yes, the only real dragon we
have now is Fae right here.@0003
@0008@0010@0104@0012@0017Hi...@0003
@000C@0014@0017This little girl is a dragon?@0003
@000A@0013Yes, though she has
not yet matured.@0003
@000C@0012Elder, do you know anything about
the dragons fighting for Bern?@0003
@000A@0014What?!
Bern is allied with dragons?@0003
@000CYes, we have seen them.@0003
@000AI do not know...@0003
Dragons are not supposed to exist in
this world, except for in this village.@0003
@0008@0011@0008@0010@011BElder,
if I may.@0003@001C
@000AWhat is it, Igrene?@0003@001C
@0008@0014Sophia said that she could detect an
evil force emanating from Bern's troops.@0003
It may be related to the dragons Roy
says he has seen with Bern.@0003
@001C
@000A@0013Perhaps...@0003
I am too old to detect
such forces now myself.@0003@001C
@000CSophia can detect an evil force?
What does that mean?@0003@001C
@000A@0014Sophia is half dragon and half human.@0003
That gives her the ability to detect
the auras emitted by other dragons.@0003
She says, however, that she detects an
unnaturally twisted force from Bern.@0003@001C
@0008I think that it should be
investigated further.@0003
Elder, if you will allow it, I would like
to join Roy so that I might learn more.@0003
@001C
@000AI would prefer not to involve
ourselves in outside matters...@0003
But this is certainly a
special case.@0003@0002
Will you take her, Roy?@0003
@001C
@000CCertainly.@0003
@0008I am Igrene,
Guardian of Nabata.@0003
I am confident in my skills
with the bow.@0003
I believe I can aid you
in battle.@0003
@000CI appreciate it.@0003
@0008@0011@0008@0010@0104@0012@0017I want to go too!@0003
@000A@0014@0017
Don't be ridiculous. You may not.@0003
There is no telling what may happen if
the world learns of your existence!@0003@001C
@0008@0080@000A@0012@0016......@0003@0016@001C
@0008@0011@000A@0011
@000A@0010@011B@0014@000CIf there is nothing else,
let's be off.@0003
@000A@0013Yes, let's.@0003
@000A@0011@000C@0011@0006
@0008@0010@0104...Fine... I will just follow
them sneakily!@0003
[0144]
@0008@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0143
@0008@0013@0017Commander Raith, I have an update on
the girl we captured...@0003
@000C@0014Girl?@0003
The one that was scurrying
around outside the castle?@0003
@0080@000DI distinctly recall telling
you to throw her out!@0003
@0008@0013But sir, she was
carrying this.@0003
@0008@0080@000C@000BIs this...a dragonstone?@0003
@000A@0014...I believe so.@0003
@000BDo you know what this
is used for?@0003
@000AI saw ones like it in the invasion of Lycia.@0003
The manaketes that joined us carried
them when they were in human form.@0003
@000B...This one does look a tad different from
the other dragonstones I've seen.@0003
Still, the possibility that she is
a dragon cannot be ignored.@0003
We should inform King Zephiel and
await further orders.@0003
Keep the girl inside the castle!@0003
[0145]
@000B@0010@0102@0017Fae has been taken
to that castle?@0003@001C
@000D@0010@0154@0013That's what the
locals told me.@0003@0011@001C
@0009@0010@011BRoy, I apologize...@0003
This is my fault for not
considering what Fae might do.@0003
We have no time for this rescue.
We must hurry to Aquileia.@0003
@000B@0014This is nobody's fault.@0003
If Bern gets their hands on her,
it could be catastrophic.@0003
@0009She should be safe as long as she remains
in human form and hides her dragonstone.@0003
@000BDragonstone?@0003
@0009When dragons are in human form, they
seal their power into dragonstones.@0003
Dragons use vast amounts of energy
to maintain their true shape,@0003
so most remain in human form to
minimize the stress on their bodies.@0003
@000BThat must be what the unhumans
with Bern do as well.@0003
@0009From what you have told me,
that seems most likely.@0003
Dragons have apparently been taking human
form since the end of the Scouring.@0003
@000BFor that long...?@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
@0009@0011@0009@0010@0154@0014Lord Roy, the spy we sent
to the castle has returned.@0003
@000BWhat did he find out?@0003
@0009Many soldiers are coming
out of the castle.@0003
They seem to be fortifying
their defenses.@0003
@000BThey must have discovered
that Fae is a dragon...@0003
@0009The troops on the border
seem to have noticed us.@0003
@000BThen we must move quickly.@0003
[0146]
@000C@0010@011A@0009@0010@010A
@0009@0017Perceval,
you don't have to do this.@0003
@000CPlease don't worry about me, Sir Douglas.
You must return to King Mordred.@0003
@0009But attacking the Lycian Army...?
It is pointless.@0003
@000CRoartz only wants me out of
the capital.@0003
He's worried I'll stab him in the
back when he isn't looking.@0003
@0009That man, worrying about traitors?@0005
Hah!@0003
Why, he was the first to betray
his loyalty to the king!@0003
Truly a snake if I ever met one.@0003
@000CNo one's loyalty to Etruria can
compare to yours, Sir Douglas.@0003
@0009Rubbish.
Just look at yourself.@0003
@000C...When Prince Myrddin still lived,
I never hesitated to fulfill his will.@0003
I believed I could dedicate my life
to him and the good of Etruria.@0003
My actions now protect the king's life,
and yet...@0003
@0009You hesitate?@0003
@000CFrankly, yes.
It feels meaningless.@0003
@0009Perceval, I want you to listen to me.
Don't respond. Let it sink in.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Etruria...@0004will fall along with the
king before this war ends.@0003
@000CSir Douglas?!@0003
@0009No matter what happens,
I will stay by the king's side.@0003
But you, Perceval, are of a different breed.
You must lead the Etruria of tomorrow.@0003
Despite the impending collapse, I firmly
believe Etruria will prosper once more.@0003
Perceval, you must leave Etruria for
now and await your time.@0003
@000C@0080@000DSir Douglas!
What do--@0003
@000D@0010@01D7General Perceval!@0003
The Lycian Army
stands dead ahead!@0003
What are your orders, sir?@0003
@0009Go! I will return
to Aquileia.@0003@0011
@000B...Move forth!
Pursue the Lycian Army!@0003
[0147]
@0009@0010@0150@000C@0010@0117@0013@0017This is a
battlefield...@0003
@0009What do we do, Boss?@0003
@000C@0014The armies are gonna loot the villages.
We better get to 'em first.@0003
@0009@0012All right, Boss!@0003
@000C@0014Just don't hurt anybody who
isn't askin' for it. Got it?@0003
@0009@0012Yeah, yeah...@0003@000C@0011@0006
@0009@0014He's too nice for his own good...@0003
If anything happens to the villagers,
we can just say the armies did it.@0003
[0148]
@000C@0010@0143@0009@0010@01D7
@0009Commander Raith,
the reinforcements are ready!@0003
@000CExcellent.
Deploy them now.@0003
@0009Yes, sir.@0003
[0149]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@012B
@000CPerceval.
It is good to see you.@0003
@0009@0017You're...!!@0003
@000C@0017Have you forgotten my face?@0003
@0009@0017No... I could never.
But it cannot be...@0003
The prince...is dead.@0003
@000C@0017...I understand your confusion.@0003
A man who was declared dead
stands before your very eyes.@0003
@0009@0017Prince Myrddin!
It is you...!@0003
@000C@0017I'm sorry to have put you
through such trouble.@0003
...It has already been over a year
since the attempt on my life.@0003
@0009@0017Attempt on your life?!@0003
I thought Your Highness fell
off his horse in an accident.@0003
@000CI was hit with
poisoned darts.@0003
One to my horse...
and one to myself...@0003
@0009No...@0003
@000CDouglas was the first to notice and
made it public that I had died.@0003
A look-alike corpse was placed
in my coffin.@0003
It was all an act to make it appear that
the assassination had been successful.@0003
Douglas entrusted me to his daughter
and had me escape to the Western Isles.@0003
@0009Sir Douglas knew
all this time...@0003
@000CEven after I escaped west, the poison
had me ill for many months.@0003
I drifted between life and death for so long
that Douglas' daughter nearly lost hope.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CThe resistance force nursed me
back to health.@0003
Ironic, isn't it?@0003
The resistance, enemy of the nobility,
saved the life of the prince of Etruria!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000CMy recovery...was slow.@0003
I saw the crimes committed by
Etrurian nobles firsthand.@0003
I felt so ashamed that I had never
noticed while I was on the throne.@0003
@0009Your Highness...@0003
@000CAs I aided the resistance, I waited for
my chance to return to the mainland.@0003
Then along came Roy,
and I knew it was time.@0003
That is how I ended up here.@0003
@0009@0017My prince...@0003
I am thankful beyond words
that you are alive.@0003
@000C@0017I am now with the Lycian Army,
and my identity must remain hidden.@0003
However, if I still have the loyalty
you pledged to me in the past...@0003
@0009@0017Until the day I die,
my prince.@0003
I have only one master, and it
is you, Prince Myrddin.@0003
[014A]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@0126
@000CSir Perceval!@0003
It is you, isn't it?
I've been looking for you!@0003
I am...@0003
@000C@0011@000C@0010@0126
@0017Wait! Wait!
Stop!@0003
Listen to me!@0003
@0009...Who are you?@0003
@000CYou don't remember?!
We met before.@0003
@0009...I think I recall seeing you
at Douglas's manor.@0003
@000C@0017Yes!
That's me.@0003
@0009@0017But the girl I met then was
far less...garish.@0003
@000CWhat's that supposed to mean?
Ah, never mind.@0003@0017
My name is Larum.@0003
I'm here on the orders
of Prince Myrddin.@0003
@0009@0017Prince Myrddin...?
Don't be daft.@0003
The prince passed away in
an accident over a year ago.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, well...
Look at this!@0003
@0009@0017That emblem...!!
It belonged to the prince...!@0003
@000C@0017Now do I have your attention?
Look at this letter, too.@0003
The prince told me to give
it to you.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
His Highness's handwriting...
He lives!@0003
I hesitate no more.@0003
If the prince is in the Lycian Army,
then I am as well.@0003
@0011@0006
@000C@0017Wha--?
That was quick...@0003
I was hoping things would get
a little more dramatic...@0003
Like, "If you want my skill,
you'll have to best me first!"@0003
Oh well. This works too.@0003
[014B]
@0009@0010@0117@000C@0010@0122
@000C@0012@0017Wait!@0003
@0009@0013What?
Who are you?@0003
@000C@0014Why are you attacking
the villages?@0003
@0009Excuse me?
Who d'you think you are?@0003
@000CI asked you a question.@0003
Tell me why you're
attacking the villages!@0003
@0009"Why?"
I guess it's yer fault, really.@0003
@000COur fault?@0003
@0009Yep.@0003
You idiots make war, and poor folk like
me resort to raidin' to survive.@0003
@000CWe fight to help
people like you.@0003
@0009D'you know how many
times I've heard that?@0003
This is reality, kid.@0003
You all say yer tryin' to help, but
it's all hot air and empty promises.@0003
If yer gonna say somethin' like
that, then prove it.@0003
You don't even know what's goin' on.
Now get outta my way.@0003
@000C@0012...No.@0003
@0009@0014Listen, I ain't playin' games
with you.@0003
If ya don't get outta here, I'll
do somethin' we'll both regret...@0003
@000CI won't move.
Kill me if you will.@0003
@0009@0012What...?@0003
@000C@0014If I let you pass, then I too have
said nothing but hot air.@0003
I tell the truth!
We fight to help the people.@0003
@0009@0012Heh heh... You...@0003@0002
@0017I've never met anyone
so naive as you.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Do you...
laugh at me...?@0003
@0009@0014@0017Still, you've moved this old
raider's heart.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Does that mean...?@0003
@0009@0014@0017Yep. You win.
I'll stop lootin'.@0003
But let me fight with you.@0003
Show me firsthand that yer
true to yer words.@0003
@000CThank you.@0003
After being with us for a while,
I'm positive you will understand.@0003
@0009Well, ya certainly
seem confident at least.@0003
I'm Garret.
And you are...?@0003
@000CLilina.@0003
@0009Lilina?@0003
It's a pleasure to make yer
acquaintance, milady.@0003
[014C]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@0102
@000CGeneral Perceval!@0003
@0009@0017General Roy.@0003
I wish to join your cause.
Will you accept me?@0003
@000C@0017Absolutely!@0003
We're honored to have
someone of your ability.@0003
But why the sudden
change of heart?@0003
@0009...Must I answer
that question?@0003
@000C@0017No, I won't force you if you
have reason not to tell.@0003
@0009@0017Forgive me.@0003
I shall tell you
when the time comes.@0003
[014D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015F
@0017A little girl was taken
to the castle...@0003
Here, I'll give you this.
Please rescue her.@0003
Our priest always had
this tome with him.@0003
...He was taken to the castle,
too, but he never returned.@0003
[014E]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0160
This is a Hammerne staff.@0003
It can repair your weapons,
spell tomes, and staves.@0003
Just about the only thing it
can't repair is itself.@0003
It'll wear down every time you
use it, so wield it wisely.@0003
[014F]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015E
I've been hearing about
bandits in this area.@0003
I bet they're all
savage killers.@0003
They probably have no
conscience at all.@0003
[0150]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0161
The rumors say that the three Generals
of Etruria have been divided...@0003
But so have the hearts of
the people.@0003
I only hope they don't have to
fight against each other...@0003
[0151]
@0010@0143@0017What is your purpose here?@0003
I don't know why you would
attack us.@0003
[0152]
@0010@0143@0017It's that girl,
isn't it...?@0003
She isn't human...
Why...do you seek her...?@0003
To use her power...?
Gah...!@0003
[0153]
@0008@0010@0154@0013@0017Lord Roy!
Here she is!@0003
@000C@0010@0102You found her?@0003
@0008@0014I believe you owe Lord Roy
a thank you, young lady.@0003@0080@0004
@000A@0010@0104@0013...Sniff...@0003
@000CEasy, Merlinus.@0003@0008@0011
@000C@0014...Why did you follow us?@0003
@000A@0013I just wanted to see
the outside world...@0003@001C
@0008@0010@0154@0014You put yourself in danger
for such a trivial reason?!@0003
Do you know how much
trouble you've caused?@0003@001C
@000A@0080@000CBut...but...
@0080@000CI'm never, ever allowed outside!@0003
The elder says I have to
remain hidden...@0003
I'm always alone...
locked up in my room...@0003
@000C@0016@0012......@0003@001C
@0008@0016@0013Lord Roy,
what shall we do?@0003@001C
@000C@0014...You could have been killed.@0003
Do you understand how much worry
and trouble you've caused?@0003
@000A@0013Yes...
I'm sorry...@0003
@000C@0014Truly?@0003
@000AYes... Sniff...@0003
@000C@0017All things considered, I think we have
no choice but to take you with us.@0003
@000A@0080@000C@0012Really?!@0003@001C
@0008@0013@0017Are you sure?@0003@001C
@000C@0014The enemy might already know
about her now.@0003
If that's true, she'll be safer with us
than returning unguarded to Arcadia.@0003
@000A@0080@000C@0080@000C@0013@0017Hurray!@0003
@0008Hush! This isn't
cause for celebration.@0003
@000CYou mustn't run off
alone anymore.@0003
Do you promise?@0003
@000A@0080@000C@0013Yes!
I pinky swear!@0003
[0154]

[0155]

[0156]
@0009@0010@0142@0017
Curses! A thousand curses...!
The Lycian Army still stands!@0003
How have they come so far?!@0003
@000B@0010@01D7G-General Narcian...@0003
Head Wyvern General Murdock
is here!@0003
@0009He is?!@0003
Th-then posthaste!
Send an escort!@0003
Ensure he receives
every hospitality...@0003
@000BHe is already here...@0003
@000D@0010@0147Yes. Enough.
Step aside.@000B@0011@0003
@0009@0017S-Sir Murdock...
What a pleasant surprise!@0003
What brings you all the
way from Ilia?@0003
@000D@0080@000E@0017
Enough of your squirrelly
pleasantries, Narcian.@0003
I want an explanation for
this embarrassment.@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0012@0017I-I'm sorry, Sir Murdock...@0003
I don't believe I understand...@0003
@000C@0014@0017
Then allow me to explain.
Princess Guinivere has escaped yet again.@0003
Flaer, your lieutenant, has failed
in the Western Isles and is dead.@0003
And finally, perhaps most
egregious of all,@0003
you have neglected your mission to
capture the village in Nabata,@0003
despite specific orders directly
from King Zephiel's mouth!@0003@0002
This is inexcusable, Narcian!
Explain yourself!@0003
@0008@0013Oh, th-that...@0003
Well, you see, there have been many
complications, so I took it upon myself to--@0003
@000CHold your tongue.
That's enough.@0003
I've orders from the king.@0003
I am to revoke your title
of Wyvern General.@0003
@0008What?!@0003
@000CYou are to be
replaced by Galle.@0003
@0008@0080@000BSir Murdock!
Please wait!@0003
Allow me one more chance!!@0003
@000C...The Lycian Army
approaches fast.@0003
Show your worth and
stop them in their tracks.@0003
If you succeed, perhaps the
king will reconsider.@0003
@0009Sir Murdock...@0003
@000C@0013Narcian...@0003
Don't fail the king,@0004
or me,@0004 again.@0003
[0157]
@000D@0010@0142@0017Balderdash!
A demotion?!@0003
And I'm to be replaced by Galle
of all people...!@0003
Never!
I will not allow it!@0003
B-but what is left for
me to do...? No...!@0003
My status and reputation...
Everything is crumbling down!@0003
@0008@0010@01D7@0013General Narcian,
the enemy draws near...@0003
@000D@0080@000E@0013Silence!
I know that already.@0003
@0014@0017...Wait.@0003
Melady's younger brother is
stationed in this castle...@0003
And Melady's the one who
helped the princess escape!@0003
Ah-ha!@0003
I can say he was leaking information
to the enemy! What a flawless plan!@0003
@0016Hm hm hm hm...@0016@0003
@0008@0013@0017I'm sorry, General Narcian...
What was that?@0003
@000C@0014@0017Hm?@0003
Oh. You know Melady's
younger brother, don't you?@0003
@0008@0013@0017You mean Sir Zeiss?@0003
@000C@0014@0017That's him. Zeiss.@0003
@0017I have reason to suspect he's leaking
information to the Lycian Army.@0003
Bring him here.@0003
@0008@0013What?!@0003
I can't believe that Sir Zeiss
would ever do such a thing...@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0014Yes, yes, it's shocking! I know!
Now shut your trap!@0003
Do as you're told and
bring him before me!@0003
[0158]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017This is Castle Aquileia, Lord Roy.@0003
Our information says that the
revolutionaries are stationed inside.@0003
@000CI thank you for your help,
Father Yoder.@0003
Thanks to the church, we were able
to avoid a battle in the city.@0003
@0009No, it is I who must
thank you.@0003
The church has been persecuted
by the revolutionaries.@0003
Were it not for you, we would have
been forced out already.@0003
@000CPersecuted?
Why?@0003
@0009I can only presume it is because of our
investigation into Bern's dragons.@0003
Before she ascended to heaven, our founder,
Saint Elimine, said these words:@0003
"Allow not dragons to return to this realm,
for that would bring suffering to many."@0003
That's why we must do everything we can
to send the dragons back to their world.@0003
@000C...The revolutionaries are with Bern, so that
explains the persecution of the church.@0003
@0009Indeed.@0003
@0014We have discovered something
interesting as well.@0003
The return of the dragons is tied to the
Fire Emblem, Bern's greatest treasure.@0003
We don't yet know how, so that's why I
sent Saul and Dorothy to investigate.@0003
@000CHmm.@0003
@0009Lord Roy, you must stop
the revolutionaries.@0003
If you would allow me to give
you one more piece of advice,@0003@001C
try talking to some of the troops.@0003
I'm certain many of them were forced
into the army against their will.@0003
@000COf course.
Thank you again.@0003
@0009Saint Elimine's blessings upon you,
Lord Roy.@0003
[0159]
@000B@0010@0146@0080@000D@0017Th-the enemy is
at our doorstep!@0003
@000A@0010@013DOh... What can we do?@0003
If we're captured, we will
be tried as traitors!@0003
@000B@0011@000A@0011
@000D@0010@010A@0016@0012......@0003@0011
@000A@0010@013D@000B@0010@0146
@000A@0080@000C@0016@0014...Arcardo! This is all your fault!@0003
If you had eliminated the Lycian Army at
the Isles as you were supposed to...@0003
@000B@0080@000DB-but Lord Roartz...!
...No!@0003
This is neither the time nor
place to argue, my lord!@0003
We must make our
escape quickly!@0003
@000A@0013But escape to where...?@0003
@000B@0080@000D...Let us turn to Bern!@0003
This plot originated from
them to begin with...@0003
@000A@0014Yes, of course!@0003
We have proven
ourselves useful.@0003
They're sure to offer us
suitable positions.@0003
@000B@0011@000D@0010@010A@0013...And what do you intend
to do with the king?@0003
@000A@0014Er... Well, Bern will probably see
that no harm comes to him.@0003
King Zephiel's mother was
Etrurian, after all.@0003
Douglas, I suggest
you flee as well...@0003
@000DAnd I suggest you shut your mouth.@0003
I only fought alongside you because
King Mordred's life was at stake.@0003
I do not intend to go along with
your scheme to the end.@0003
@000A@0080@000C@0013Hmph! Unbending as always.
Suit yourself.@0003
Arcardo, we escape now!@0003
@0011
@000B@0010@0146Lord Roartz!
Wait for me...@0003@0011@0006
[015A]
@000D@0010@010A@0017...Dirty traitors!@0003
@0017Fleeing with their tails
between their legs...@0003
@0017I can't imagine it took much for
Bern to seduce them.@0003
They'll meet their end at the hands
of the Lycian Army before long...@0003@0002
When Prince Myrddin returns...
Etruria will be whole again.@0003
But until then...I shall continue
to fight for the king.@0003
My loyalty and honor as Great General
depend upon it!@0003
[015B]

[015C]
@000C@0010@0136@0017Zeiss.
Where are you?@0003
[015D]
@000C@0010@0136@0009@0010@012A@0014I'm here, Sir Galle.
Is something wrong?@0003
Why did you summon me?@0003
@000C@0017Zeiss, you must hide.@0003
@0009...What do you mean?
The enemy is before us!@0003
@000CListen to me.@0003
General Narcian has given the order
for you to be taken prisoner.@0003
@0009@0013What?!@0003
Does he think that
I have betrayed Bern?!@0003
@000C@0014He needs a scapegoat for
his failures.@0003
He says that you worked with Melady
to leak information to the enemy.@0003
@0009With my sister?
I don't even know where she is.@0003
@000C@0013Melady has apparently joined the
Lycian Army alongside the princess.@0003
@0009@0014Melady turned to the enemy?!
I don't believe it for a second...@0003
@000CAsk her yourself.
She is apparently here.@0003
Would that I could go with you,@0003
but General Murdock ordered me to
observe the outcome of the battle.@0003
Zeiss, get out while you still can.
Talk to Melady.@0003
@0009@0013Sir Galle!
I...@0003
@000C@0014I will not make a move until
I hear Melady's story.@0003@0011
[015E]
@0009@0010@012A@0016@0012......@0003
[015F]
@000C@0010@0123@0017The Etrurian nobles have fled?
Are you kidding me?@0003
What about my money?
I haven't been paid yet!@0003
[0160]
@000C@0010@012C
I can hear the riches calling
to me! "Cath! Take us!"@0003
This is the most extravagant
palace in Elibe...@0003
I bet the treasure's nothing to
sneeze at, either.@0003
It was all taken from people like me
anyway, so I'm just reclaiming it!@0003
[0161]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102
@0009Hey, fella!@0003
You lead the army that's
attacking the castle, right?@0003
Do you have any need of
an extra mage?@0003
@000C@0017Huh? Well, I guess we could
always use more...@0003
@0009@0017You don't say!
Then today is your lucky day.@0003
Here's a mage for hire.
How about it?@0003
@000C@0012@0017You know a mage?
Where is he?@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0013@0017Er, I was talking
about myself, buddy!@0003
@000C@0016@0012......@0003
@000A@0016@0013Hey, don't look at
me like that!@0003
I'm no slouch with
a spell tome.@0003
I'm all yours for
10,000 gold!@0003
@000C@001710,000?!
That seems pretty steep...@0003
@000A@0017Come on, you're breakin'
my heart here!@0003
I need the money for
my grandmother...@0003
@000C@0017What?@0003
Is your grandmother sick
or something?@0003
@000A@0080@000B@0014@0017Er... Y-yeah! That's it.
Sick is a good way to describe her...@0003
Anyway, I need the cash.
Come on, pal!@0003
[0162]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102
@0013@0017If your grandmother's sick, then I suppose
it's a worthy cause for the money...@0003
[0163]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102
@0017Well...
@0018
[0164]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0080@000D@0017If your grandmother's sick, then I suppose
it's a worthy cause for the money...@0003
@0009You betcha! She's so sick
you don't even know.@0003
She always gets these headaches
on her back...@0003
@000B@0013Huh?
Headaches on her back?@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0017Uh, y-you know what I mean.@0003
That's just one of her many symptoms,
each worse than the last...@0003@0002
...OK, all the money seems
to be here.@0003
You won't regret this.
I know what I'm doing!@0003
@0011@000B@0016@0012......@0003
[0165]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102
@0017I'm sorry, but I can't justify paying
10,000 gold for a single mage.@0003
@0009@0013What?!@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0014...W-well, I guess I can take
it down to 8,000...@0003
@000C@0012Hm...@0003
@000A@0080@000C@0013@0017Come on, please?@0003
[0166]
@000A@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102@000C@0013@0017I'm sorry, but...@0003
@000A@0014S-still no good?@0003
Uh... Well, I guess
6,000 will do...@0003
@000C@0012Er...@0003
@000A@0080@000C@0013Please. I really
need the money...@0003
[0167]
@000A@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0016@0012......@0003
@000A@0014@0017......@0003
@0016@0080@000CAll right, all right!
Now I'm desperate...@0003
5,000! That's my final offer!@0003
@000C@0016@0012.........@0003
@000A@0080@000C@0016@0013Come on, I'm begging you!
Please hire me!@0003
[0168]
@000A@0010@0123@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0080@000F@0017I'm sorry.@0003
@000A@0013
...Please... I swear
I'll be useful...@0003
@000D@0014The money isn't mine to spend.@0003
I can't use so much of
it in one place.@0003
@000AArgh! I give up! Fine!
Have it your way.@0003
@000A@0080@000BI don't want to work for
you anyway... Ha!@0003
You're a nobody! You don't even
know a steal when you see one!@0003@0011
@000D@0016@0012......@0003
[0169]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0134
@0009@0012@0017Cecilia.@0003
@000C@0014Sir Douglas...@0003
Why is someone of your stature
fighting for the revolutionaries...?@0003
@0009@0013The king's safety takes
priority over all.@0003
There is nothing more to
it than that.@0003
@000C@0014If this continues, Etruria will
become a mere puppet of Bern!@0003
The king must have dominion over
this nation for us to serve him.@0003
The path you are on will only
lead to Etruria's destruction!@0003
@0009If the nation is doomed to
collapse, then so be it.@0003
But I will ensure the
king's safety!@0003
@000CWhat...?!@0003
Our loyalty is to our people,
to our nation!@0003
The Etrurian Army exists for
the people.@0003
The soldiers are not the king's
personal bodyguards!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016Perhaps you are right,
but I will not waver.@0003
Cecilia, you must follow your
beliefs, as I must follow mine.@0003
[016A]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@010D
@000C@0013@0017General Douglas...@0003
@0009Klein. I have known you
since you were but a child.@0003
I never expected to fight
you like this.@0003
@000C@0014General Douglas,
please reconsider!@0003
You are the Great General, the
highest rank in the Etrurian Army!@0003
How can you align yourself with
these traitors...?!@0003
@0009...Klein.
I am a soldier.@0003
@000C@0012What...?@0003
@0009@0014Our king's life is at Bern's mercy.@0003
I cannot cast away my loyalty
and turn to the enemy.@0003
@000C@0012But...@0003
@0009@0014...There are those who toss away
their honor for riches and power.@0003
I will not do the same. My loyalty
to the king will never falter.@0003
@000C@0016@0012......@0003
@0009@0016@0014I am an old man, and
my time has come.@0003
The Etrurian Army belongs to
your generation now.@0003
I only ask that you lead it
in a way I would be proud.@0003
@000C@0013General Douglas...@0003
@0009@0014...Go.@0003
[016B]
@0009@0010@012A@000C@0010@012E
@0009@0012@0017Melady!!@0003
@000C@0013Zeiss?!
What are you doing here?@0003
@0009@0014...I've been accused of
betraying Bern.@0003
@000C@0013Oh no...!@0003
I feel...I am at
fault for this...@0003
@0009@0014Sir Galle said that you
had joined the enemy.@0003
I couldn't believe it, but now
I see it with my own eyes!@0003
Why?!
Why did you betray Bern?@0003
@000CI never betrayed Bern.
I have always served Princess Guinivere.@0003
@0009You threw away everything...
Your homeland, your family...@0003
Even your beloved Galle...
for the princess.@0003
For that...obstinate princess
who betrayed her own brother!@0003
@000CEnough, Zeiss!@0003
I will not tolerate you
insulting Princess Guinivere!@0003
@0009@0016@0012......@0003
@000C@0016@0014It is the princess, not the king,
who works for the good of Bern.@0003
At first I was angry and confused
that she did not tell me more.@0003
But now that I am again at
her side, I understand...@0003
She is not mistaken.@0003
@0009@0013...Sir Galle was right.@0003
@000C@0012What? Galle?@0003
@0009@0014He said that he wouldn't move
until he heard your side.@0003
@000C@0013He did...?@0003
@0009@0014@0017I'm not sure yet if I agree with you...
but I know I can trust you.@0003
@000C@0013Zeiss!
Does that mean...?@0003
@0009@0014If the leader of the Lycian Army
will allow it, I want to go with you.@0003
I want to see the princess that
moved you so.@0003
[016C]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0126
@000CFather!@0003
@0009@0017Larum!
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0017I joined the Lycian Army
along with Prince Myrddin...@0003
@0009The prince has returned!
There is hope for Etruria once more...@0003
@000CFather...@0003
@0009@0017Larum... I'm sorry I put
you through so much.@0003
I had no choice but to send you
away to protect the prince.@0003
@000CNo, I wanted to.
It's OK.@0003
@0009...I sent you right back into the
harsh world I saved you from.@0003
I just wish there had been
another way.@0003
@000C...You saved me from a terrible life
of poverty...and starvation...@0003
You raised me as one of your
own blood...@0003
I owe you my life. I'm just glad
I could repay your favor.@0003
@0009Larum...@0003
@000C@0017So really...
I was happy to do it.@0003
@0009Thank you, Larum.@0003
...I trust the prince will be safe
in your care in the future as well.@0003
@000C@0017What are you talking about?
You're not coming with us?@0003
@0009King Mordred is still in the
hands of Bern.@0003
Were I to turn to the Lycian Army now,
they would surely take his head.@0003
@000C...But...@0003
@0009Now that the prince is back,
I have no regrets.@0003
If the Lycian Army strikes me
down, I will die in peace.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009Now go.@0003
If anyone sees us talking like this,
you may be suspected of betrayal.@0003
@0017No matter what happens, remember
that you are my daughter.@0003
In this world, and the next...@0003
@000C@0017Father...@0003
@0009@0017My only hope is that you
find happiness in life...@0003
[016D]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@012B
@000C@0017Douglas!@0003
@0009@0017Prince Myrddin!
You have returned!@0003
You appear to be in good health...
I'm so glad you yet live.@0003
@000C@0017I have you to thank for that.
I'm sorry to have put you through so much.@0003
@0009@0017You have returned safely...
Nothing else matters more to me.@0003
@000C@0017Douglas, I am working with
the Lycian Army now.@0003
@0009@0017Very good!@0003
Then all that remains is to drive
Bern's troops from the palace.@0003
@000C@0017What will you do?@0003
@0009The king is still in Bern's hands...@0003
Were I to turn to the Lycian Army now,
they would surely take his head.@0003
@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0009But now that you have returned,
I have no regrets.@0003
If the Lycian Army strikes me down,
I will die in peace.@0003
@000CDouglas...
I apologize.@0003
You intend to sacrifice your
life for my father...@0003
@0009@0017My prince, if my death can serve Etruria,
then I give it freely.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009I am just glad that I could see
you again before I pass.@0003
@000C@0017You risked your life to protect me
and send me away to safety.@0003
I will never forget that. Never.@0003
@0009...I still have one futile hope.
I wish to take you to see the king...@0003
@000C...Don't lose that
hope just yet.@0003
Roy...has a knack for
overcoming the impossible...@0003
[016E]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@011A
@000C@0017Sir Douglas!@0003
@0009Perceval...@0003
I see in your eyes that you 
have no more hesitation.@0003
@000CYes, Sir Douglas. That is thanks to you.@0003
Once I learned that you saved Prince Myrddin,
I regained the will to fight.@0003
@0009Then you fight with the prince.
I'm glad to hear it.@0003
@000CWhat are you going
to do, Sir Douglas?@0003
@0009The king is still in
the hands of Bern.@0003
If I turn to the Lycian Army now,
they will take his life.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009If you indeed fight with the prince,
then that means he has returned.@0003
I have no more regrets. If the Lycian
Army kills me here, so be it.@0003
@000CJust the answer I expected,
Sir Douglas.@0003
@0009You will walk the same
path as I, Perceval.@0003
Please watch over the prince...
and over all of Etruria.@0003
@000COf course.
That is what I live for.@0003
[016F]
@0010@0142@0017I am strong. I am wise.
I am beautiful.@0003
And most importantly,
I am right! Always!@0003@0002
...Me! No one else!@0003
[0170]
@0010@0142@0017No... No...!!@0003@0002
I will not be defeated...!
Not by you...miserable...@0003@0002
Gaahh!!@0003
[0171]
@0008@0010@0159@000B@0010@0102
@0008So it is you...
who rescued us.@0003
@000B@0013@0017My name is Roy. I am leader of
the Lycian Army.@0003
@0008My name is Mordred.@0003
Hm...@0003
@000B@0016......@0016@0003
@0008@0014...I must ask another favor of you.@0003
Bern's soldiers have moved to
the Saint's Tower.@0003
@000BThe Saint's Tower...@0003
That is where Saint Elimine's
altar lies...@0003
@0008Yes...
It is a national symbol of Etruria.@0003
Please, recapture the tower.@0003
@000BI will do what I can.@0003
@0008@0013I thank you.@0003
Please take anything in the tower
that you may find useful.@0003
@0011@0006
@001C@000D@0010@0154
@001C@000BThe king...
He still mourns the prince.@0003
@001C@000D@0014He must have been an
easy target for Bern.@0003
@001C@000B@0014I wish I could help him...but I
wouldn't know where to begin.@0003@000D@0011@000B@0011@0005
@000C@0010@012BFather...
I am truly sorry...@0003
When the time comes,
I will make my return.@0003
[0172]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0157
@000C@0013@0017Princess Guinivere,
I must speak with you.@0003
@0009
...The attack on Bern will begin
after we finish in Etruria.@0003
@000CDid someone tell
you already?@0003
@0009@0014No... I simply knew that it would
come to this eventually.@0003
@000C...We cannot leave Bern
unopposed any longer.@0003
I know it will be painful to see
your homeland invaded, but...@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0013...Roy, I want you
to have this.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0012What is it?@0003
@000A@0013Bern's greatest treasure...
the Fire Emblem.@0003
@000B@0012What?!@0003
@000A@0080@000B@0014In southern Bern lies a temple
called the Shrine of Seals.@0003
Within it lies the sword of Hartmut,
founder of Bern.@0003
@000B@0013Is it...
a legendary weapon?@0003
@0009@0014
Yes. The most powerful of
them all, in fact.@0003
It was made to slay the leader of
the dragons in the Scouring.@0003
Its power was so immense that it had
to be sealed away after the war.@0003
The Fire Emblem is the key to
accessing it once more.@0003
@000B@0013The key...@0003
@0009@0014My brother...is forcing the world
into submission with military might.@0003
I cannot forgive him, no matter
his reasons.@0003
@000B@0016@0012......@0003
@0009@0016@0013All we must do to stop him is
defeat the dragons he commands.@0003
@000BPrincess Guinivere...@0003
@0009@0080@000A...I will be remembered in infamy,
as a traitor to my nation.@0003
@000B@0012No...@0003
@0008@0014The people will resent me
for the rest of my days.@0003
Roy, promise me this
one thing.@0003
When we invade Bern, do
not harm any civilians...@0003
@000BI will not.
I promise you.@0003
@0008@0013@0017...Thank you.@0003
[0173]
@0009@0010@0136@000C@0010@0147
@000C@0013@0017
Narcian has fallen then.@0003
@0009@0014So it seems.@0003
General Murdock, I still feel uncomfortable
that we didn't go to his aid.@0003
@000C
The king's orders explicitly
said to leave him on his own.@0003
Bern's army has no use for a man
who cannot manage his own messes.@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@0146@000A@0010@013DSir Murdock...
What will you have us do?@0003
@000C
Arcardo, I leave Castle Remi
to you.@0003
Roartz, you will take
Castle Edessa.@0003
Make preparations to defend
against the enemy.@0003
@0008
What?!
Remi is right on the border!@0003
The enemy will be here
in short time!@0003
@000CThat much is true.@0003
But this position gives us an invaluable
strategic advantage against Etruria.@0003
You must ensure that this castle does
not fall into enemy hands.@0003
@000AEdessa lies all the way in
the outer tundra of Ilia...@0003
@000C
Yes, so you will have ample time
to prepare your defenses.@0003
@0008
...You...intend only to
take the defensive?@0003
You don't mean to
take back Etruria?@0003
@000C
We play the waiting game for now.
We will take Etruria some day.@0003
And once we do, it will
be under Bern's jurisdiction.@0003
@000A@0013
What about us?! That's not
what we agreed upon!@0003
@000C
Then perhaps you should find
a way to make yourself useful.@0003
You have done nothing to
deserve such renumeration.@0003@0002
If you'll excuse us.@0003
@0011@001C
@0009@0012@0016......@0003
[0174]
@0009@0010@0136@000C@0010@0147
@0009@0017
Those two will surely be killed.
Should we really leave them?@0003
@000C
If they fall, it is because of their own
incompetence.@0003
Our army's code states that every officer
must be capable and self-sufficient.@0003
Perhaps they should have considered that
before joining us...@0003@0002
The enemy leader... Roy, was it?@0003
@0009@0012Yes, Roy of Pherae.@0003
@000C@0014
I admit he has rebuilt the
Lycian Army magnificently.@0003
@0017I thought it finished after
we crushed it the first time...@0003
I hope to cross blades with him
before the war is over.@0003
[0175]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0013@0017We will soon approach
the Etrurian border.@0003
@000C@0014Thank you for everything,
Father Yoder.@0003
We've only made it this far thanks
to the assistance of the church.@0003
@0009I am only repaying your favor.@0003
Had you not captured Aquileia, we would
suffer great persecution from Bern.@0003
This is nothing compared to what you
did for us.@0003
@000C@0013@0017It was my pleasure to
help the church.@0003
@0009@0014@0017
If I may be so bold...
Can I ask one more favor?@0003
@000COf course,
if I am capable.@0003
@0009If you discover anything
else about the dragons...@0003
@000CSay no more.@0003
If I find anything new, I will
report to you immediately.@0003
@0009@0017You have my eternal thanks.@0003@0017
...Oh yes, I have some information
that may be of use.@0003
@0009@0014At a certain time of day, the sea level drops,
exposing a crossable sandbar.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0012A sandbar?@0003
@0009
It would take much time to make your
way around the bay to the castle.@0003
However, crossing the sandbar would
be a direct journey.@0003
@000B@0013I'll bear it in mind.@0003
@0009However you choose to proceed,
please be careful.@0003
Rushing forward has its
dangers as well.@0003
@000BThank you for your advice.@0003
@0009@0014@0017Not at all.@0003
May the Etrurian Army go with
Saint Elimine's blessing.@0003

@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0146
@0009@0013@0017Lord Arcardo!
A path has appeared in the sea!@0003
@000CWhat?!@0003
@0009@0014
According to the locals, the tide
pulls out this time of day...@0003
@000C@0080@000D@000BAnd you didn't know
about this sooner?!@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0008Milord, we are foreigners here!
We do not know this land!@0003
@000B@0080@000D@0013Curses!@0003
Charge! Don't allow the
enemy to cross that path!@0003
[017A]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0013@0017Lord Roy,
we have a report.@0003
@000C@0012Did the sandbar appear?@0003
@0009@0013Yes, Father Yoder
was right.@0003
@000CDid the enemy
know about it?@0003
@0009@0014
Actually, no. They seem to
be in a panicked state.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0013
All right, then let's not
waste this opportunity!@0003
Move forward!@0003
[017B]

[017C]

[017D]

[017E]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0192
Ah, are you fighting against Bern?
Then please take this staff.@0003
It was once used by the noble
Lady Tina...@0003
[017F]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018D
Did you know that at a
certain time of day,@0003
a sandbar appears
in the bay?@0003
It's a path right
through the ocean.@0003
Good luck!@0003
[0180]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0193
The tide is very dramatic
around here.@0003
I remember once I was getting
ready to go fishing,@0003
but by the time I had my boat ready,
the tide had already gone out.@0003
[0181]
@0010@0146@0017
W-why?!@0003
What have I done to
deserve such a fate?!@0003
[0182]
@0010@0146@0017
I...am a noble...
of Etruria...!@0003@0002
I cannot...die...in a place
such as this...@0005 Gah!@0003
[0183]
@000D@0010@0154@000B@0010@0102
@000D@001C@0017Lord Arcardo...@0003
What a pathetic ending for
one of his stature.@0003
@000B@001C
A year ago I myself never imagined
I would be leading an army.@0003
Fate can be unpredictable...@0003
Perhaps we'll even be able to
turn the tides against Bern.@0003
@000D@0011@0009@0010@0154@0016...?@0003@0016
Lord Roy, what is that
in your hand?@0003
@000BOh, this?
It's the Fire Emblem.@0003
@0009That tiny gemstone...?@0003
@000B
Princess Guinivere wanted me
to keep it.@0003
It seemed...difficult for her
to give it to me...@0003
I think she still hoped to end
the war with diplomacy...@0003
@0009
Hm... Perhaps she had faith in her brother,
even if that seems unlikely.@0003
@000B@0012Why do you say that?@0003
@0009@0014
Because Zephiel is the
treacherous king of Bern!@0003
It is said that he murdered
his own father.@0003
I don't expect he would be
moved by family trust...@0003
@000B@0080@000E@0013
He killed his own father?!@0003
@0009@0014Haven't you heard the rumors, Lord Roy?@0003
Zephiel took the throne because
his father, King Desmond, passed on.@0003
But King Desmond's death was
very sudden.@0003
@000C@0013So there are rumors...?@0003
@0009@0014...Yes, that Zephiel assassinated him.@0003
@000C...Does Princess Guinivere
know about this?@0003
@0009
I'm sure she is at least
aware of the rumors.@0003
She may even know the
whole story.@0003
@000C@0012@0016......@0003
[0184]
@000C@0010@01D4@0008@0010@01D7
@0008@0017Father Martel!@0003
We have brought the hermit
Niime as you asked.@0003
@000C@0012Good.
Let her pass.@0003@0008@0011@0005
@0009@0010@0124@0013What do you want from me?@0003
@000C@0014You must be Niime,
the Mountain Hermit.@0003
@0009
I'm not aware of that nickname,
but I am Niime.@0003
I'm probably the one you seek.@0003
@000C
We found an elder spell tome
within the castle.@0003
I hear that you may be capable
of using it.@0003
@0009Perhaps.@0003
I have dedicated my life to the study of
darkness and elder magic.@0003
@000C
I understand that this spell can change
the weather surrounding the caster...@0003
@0009@0013
Stranger spells are known to exist.@0003
@000C@0014
Then I order you to use the
tome to create rainfall.@0003
Make it rain so that the
rivers overflow.@0003
Push back the advancing
Etrurian Army.@0003
@0009
I can try, but frankly I can't guarantee
that it will succeed.@0003
It is also important to remember that powerful
spells like this can only be cast once.@0003
Are you certain you want to do this?@0003
@000C@0080@000D
No excuses, hag!
You will do as I say.@0003
You said you wish to join our
forces. Make yourself useful.@0003
@0009@0012@0016......@0003
[0185]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Princess Guinivere...@0003
We are approaching
Bern's army.@0003
@0009...Yes, I know.@0003
@000C
As we get closer, we will clash with
soldiers of Bern more and more.@0003
It will not be long before we
are in full combat with Bern.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000C
I want to ask you something
before that happens.@0003
@0009Go ahead.@0003
@000C
I have heard rumors about
King Zephiel...@0003
I heard that he killed his father,
the previous king.@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0016!@0003
@000C@0016
I could scarcely believe it
myself.@0003
You believe in him so strongly that
you cast away your own country.@0003
If King Zephiel is truly as mad as
the rumors say,@0003
I'm sure you would not have done
all that you have.@0003
@0008@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Princess Guinivere,@0003
I accepted the Fire Emblem
not to use it in battle,@0003
but to find a way to end
this war peacefully.@0003
@0008Roy...@0003
@000CI think I have a right to know
the truth about the rumors...@0003
@0008I...I'm sorry.
Please...give me some time.@0003@0011
@000C@0080@000DPrincess!@0003
@0008@0010@0154@0014...What is the matter?@0003
Princess Guinivere looked
very troubled...@0003
@000B@0080@000E...It's nothing to worry over.
Do you need something?@0003@0080@0004
@0008@0080@000B@0009
Yes, I have learned some troubling
information.@0003
A powerful dark mage by the name
of Niime fights in the enemy ranks.@0003
@000C@0013A dark mage...
A druid, probably.@0003
@0009@0014
In any case, she is apparently
extremely learned in ancient sorcery.@0003
She is said to be more knowledgable
than most scholars can even imagine.@0003
@000C@0013We can't pull back now.
We press on.@0003
@0009Of course, but please
exercise caution.@0003
@000CYes, you're right.
We must tread lightly!@0003
[0186]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@01D4
@000C@0017Is the spell ready,
Niime?@0003
@0009@0013
...I'll warn you one more time.@0003
I can't guarantee the results will
be what you want...@0003
@000CEnough of your yammering!
Cast the spell!@0003
@0009@0014Sigh... Very well...@0003
[0187]
@0008@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0008@0013@0017W-what's going on...?@0003
@000CAn enemy spell caster?
Watch out, soldiers!@0003
[0188]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@01D4@0017What...?!
What is this?!@0003
The rivers...
They've frozen over!@0003
@0009@0013@0017Well, I'll be...
That's not what I expected.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@000B@0017You!
You did this on purpose!@0003
@0009@0014
Don't be absurd...@0003
I gave you ample warning that
I couldn't guarantee any results.@0003
@000BEnough! You there!
Toss her in the dungeon!@0003
@0008@0010@01D7@0012Yes, sir!@0003
@0009@001CSigh...@0003
[0189]
@000C@0010@0102@0013@0017What...happened?@0003
@0009@0010@0154@0014Lord Roy, we have a report.
The rivers have apparently frozen over.@0003
@000C@0012What?@0003
@0009@0014The ice is so thick that even knights
on horseback can cross them safely.@0003
@000C@0013Oh...@0003
Well, good. We can advance
more quickly now.@0003
Charge the castle gate!@0003
[018A]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0192
I was told that this goddess icon
would bring me good luck...@0003
But I pray to it everyday,
and nothing happens.@0003
That con man tricked me!
Here, take it.@0003
Just looking at it
is making me angry.@0003
[018B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0198
I was playing outside and
this ring fell from the sky!@0003@0002
...A gift from the gods?@0003
Nah, someone on a pegasus
or wyvern probably dropped it.@0003
Here, take it.
I prefer my dolls anyway.@0003
[018C]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0194
Are you the Etrurian Army?@0003
Sigh... Bern's army marched through
here just the other day, too.@0003
When will we have peace again?@0003
Here, take this.
Use it to end the war.@0003
[018D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018F
That Martel who's guarding the castle...@0003
He said he has some secret weapon.
I'd be careful if I were you.@0003
[018E]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0190
When it gets colder the rivers
all freeze over,@0003
and we can get to the village in
the east without much trouble.@0003
But it's not quite the
season, unfortunately.@0003
[018F]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018D
You look strong.@0003
But I bet you couldn't
beat the Sword Saint.@0003
They say he's on a
level all his own.@0003
[0190]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0196
@0017Hey, are you the Etrurian Army
that the old lady was talking about?@0003
I heard she was originally
planning to join you guys,@0003
but for some reason she
joined up with Bern instead.@0003
What is she thinking?@0003
[0191]
@0010@01D4
@0017Blast!@0003
You made it through
this snow...@0003
Curse that useless woman!@0003
[0192]
@0010@01D4
@0017No...@0003
I'm too brilliant...
to die...@0003
[0193]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0102
@0009At last, I am released
from Bern's dungeon.@0003
@000C@0017You are?@0003
@0009@0017I am Niime.@0003
I live in the mountains where
I study arcane magic.@0003
@000C@0017
Why were you in the dungeon?@0003
Did you not join Bern of
your own choice?@0003
@0009@0017
Well, actually, I did,
but it was only a guise.@0003
Bern's army has something
I wish to study.@0003
@000C@0017And what is that?@0003@0080@0004
@0009@0017The dragons.@0003
@000C@0017@0016!!@0003@0016
@0009@0017Well, that sure got your
attention, didn't it?@0003
@000C@0017The dragons you speak of...@0003
They're not like the wyverns
that Bern's soldiers ride upon.@0003
They're strange troops that fight
alongside Bern's soldiers...@0003
@0009@0017I know that well.@0003
They're the same dragons that
were defeated in the Scouring.@0003
@000C@0017How do you know this...?@0003
@0009At first I thought this was only
a simple act of aggression by Bern.@0003
But then I began to sense a strange
and...evil force among their troops.@0003
I decided to investigate.@0003
@000CDid you learn anything?@0003
@0009The dragons are very much shrouded
in mystery.@0003
I looked through many ancient books
and scrolls.@0003
I could only decipher so many of them.
But...@0003
@000CBut...?@0003
@0009I have come to the conclusion that Bern
has resurrected the demon dragon.@0003
@000CThe demon dragon...@0003
The leader of the dragons
that Hartmut defeated.@0003
@0009The very same.@0003
Dragons are a much more advanced
species than us humans.@0003
Their vitality and intellect
puts that of humans to shame.@0003
There is one thing, however, the
dragons lack in.@0003
They multiply at a fraction of
the rate humans do.@0003
But the demon dragon...@0003
It had the power to create
more dragons.@0003
That is what I learned from
my research.@0003
@000CIt can make dragons...?@0003
@0009The demon dragon can create more
of its kind.@0003
That would explain where Bern is
getting all of its dragons.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
@0009@0017Now, that being said...@0003
I wish to learn more about
the dragons.@0003
I wield dark magic...
Let me join your army.@0003
I'm sure I can be of some
assistance.@0003
@000C@0017Of course.@0003
We want to learn about
the dragons as well.@0003
It will be a perilous journey,@0003
but if that's acceptable to you,
you're welcome to join us.@0003
[0194]
@0009@0010@0153@000C@0010@0145
@0009@0017Captain!@0003
The enemy has arrived.@0003
They are just beyond
the mountains.@0003
@000C@0013@0017It begins.@0003
@0009@0017Captain,
are you sure?@0003
@000C@0012@0017About what?@0003
@0009@0014@0017
The Etrurian Army says they
will liberate us from Bern.@0003
They say they'll give us
our independence...@0003
@000C
You can't be fool enough
to believe that.@0003
No one fights a war
without gain.@0003
Once they defeat Bern,
they intend to take over.@0003
It will be the same.@0003
@0009But...@0003
@000C
Bern are the better allies. They are
more experienced in warfare.@0003
@0009@0012@0016......@0003
@000C@0014@0016
Come now, we have more
immediate problems.@0003
We must eliminate the enemy
that lies before us.@0003
Are the ballistae ready?@0003
@0009
Yes, the archers are all
at their stations.@0003
@000C@0017Good!
Fire at them from a distance.@0003
They'll be floundering around in
the dark of this powerful blizzard.@0003
Observe nature's wrath...@0003
[0195]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Such powerful wind and hail...
I can barely see in front of me.@0003
@0009@0017
Ilia's winters are always like this.@0003
If you want to fight in this weather,
you'll have to put up with it.@0003
@000C@0017
We can't allow Bern time to regroup.
We must attack now.@0003
@0009@0013@0017You're right.@0003
If the demon dragon is victorious,
it could be the end of us all.@0003
@000C@0017I've been wondering...@0003
Do you think the demon dragon
is in human form as well?@0003
@0009@0017It seems probable.@0003
It could be that all dragons in
this realm are in human form.@0003
I've even heard stories of dragons
in human form living with people.@0003
@000C@0017Arcadia...@0003
@0009@0017Hm?
What did you say?@0003
@000C@0017Er, nothing.@0003@0080@0004
@0009I've read that dragons only began to take
human form after the Ending Winter.@0003
@000CThe Ending Winter...@0003
@0009I expect you've heard of it.@0003
@000CYes, but only in legend.@0003
I learned that in the Ending Winter,
the laws of nature were all warped.@0003
Day became night, and summer
became winter.@0003
@0009That's it.@0003
The scrolls I read on the topic are so timeworn
that I couldn't decipher all of them.@0003
But one thing is clear.@0003
The Ending Winter was a disaster powerful
enough to bend and twist the whole planet.@0003
@000CWhat caused it?@0003
@0009Nobody knows for certain...@0003
Legend says the dragons caused it by
releasing vast amounts of magical power,@0003
but even this theory lacks evidence.@0003
In any case, it is certain that dragons began
to take human form after the Ending Winter.@0003
I don't believe these two occurrences
are coincidence.@0003
@000CI agree.@0003
@0009@0017Ultimately, 
the truth lies in Bern.@0003
[0196]
@0009@0010@0153@000C@0010@0145
@0009@0017Captain!@0003
Other pegasus knight squads
are on their way to assist us!@0003
@000CReally?
They will help immensely.@0003
I almost feel bad for the enemy...@0003
They'll be in a panic when they're
suddenly attacked from all directions.@0003
They won't see them coming in
this snowstorm...@0003
[0197]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0192
You would come to such an
isolated place as this...?@0003
The prophecies were
correct...@0003
When the world is covered
in darkness...@0003
A single blade of wind will
slice through the darkness,@0003
allowing the light to
shine again.@0003
[0198]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018E
I've pondered a lot about whether
I should give in to Bern...@0003
But I've made up my mind.
I'll hold strong.@0003
Take this ring. It brings out
your inner strength.@0003
...Please bring peace
back to this land.@0003
[0199]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018D
Bern's headquarters in Ilia?@0003
Um, I think it was Edarza...
Edetta... Edessa! That's it.@0003
It's to the northeast.@0003
[019A]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018F
You know about the ballista
to the east, right?@0003
We're out of its range here,
but the shop over there isn't...@0003
[019B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0195
@0017Pegasus knights and ballistae...
Captain Sigune is after you.@0003
She's hiding in the blizzard,
waiting to strike...@0003
[019C]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0191
You go up against Ivory Devil
Sigune. I wish you luck.@0003
The Ilian pegasus knights
can fly through the blizzard.@0003
You'll be blinded by the white...@0003
and then they will suddenly appear
out of the swirling snow.@0003
But when that happens it's too
late... You're already dead...@0003
[019D]
@0010@0145
So...you've made it through
the blizzard.@0003@0002
Congratulations.@0003
Unfortunately, the only prize
that awaits you is death.@0003
[019E]
@0010@0145
...Dear me...@0003
I didn't anticipate
perishing here...@0003
But perhaps...
I was already dead...@0003
Perhaps I died...
a long...time ago...@0003
[019F]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0154
@000C@0017Merlinus, I need you to send this
letter to Father Yoder in Etruria.@0003
@0009A letter?
May I ask what it says?@0003
@000CIt has the information I learned
from Niime about the dragons.@0003
@0009Oh?@0003
What did you learn?@0003
@000C
It would take too long to tell you.@0003
I haven't sealed the letter yet, so
you can look through it if you like.@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0008@0013Very well.
I think I will...@0003@0011@0007@0080@0004
@0008@0010@0157@0016......@0003@0016
@000CIs something wrong,
Princess Guinivere?@0003
@0008@0080@000B...I wish to tell you
about my brother.@0003
@000C
...You don't mind?@0003
@0009No...@0003
I want you to know before
we enter Bern...@0003
I want you to know the
tragedies that have occurred.@0003
You asked before if my
brother murdered our father.@0003
@000CYes...?@0003
@0009To be frank...@0005
he did.@0003
@000C
King Zephiel killed his own
father to seize the throne...@0003
@0009@0080@000CNo!@0003
@000CNo?@0003
@000A
Our father tried to kill
Zephiel first.@0003
@000CWhat?!
Then King Zephiel...@0003
@000AHe couldn't bear the abuse
he took from our father.@0003
So he...@0003
@000CWhat...?
Why did--@0003@0080@0004
@0008@0010@0154@0014
The dragons are mysterious
creatures indeed... Hm?@0003
What is the matter?@0003
@001C
@000A@0013It is nothing...
Perhaps later...@0003@0011@0006
@0008@0014...Did I appear at
a bad time?@0003
@000CNo, it's fine.
Did you send the letter?@0003
@0008@0080@000BYes, I sent it off after
reading through it.@0003
@000CThank you.@0003@0009@0011
@000C...Why did the old king try
to murder his own son...?@0003
[01A0]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@013D@0013
Well?
How does it look?@0003
@0009@0014@0017
Actually, milord...we've requested aid
from Ilia's knights,@0003
but all but those directly under
Sir Murdock seem reluctant to help.@0003
@000C@0080@000E
Curses! Things couldn't
possibly get any worse...@0003@0002
Ah, but we did capture
Zelot's wife.@0003
What is the word on Zelot's
troop? Have they responded?@0003
@0009No, milord...@0003
They are traveling mercenary knights,
so we do not know their location.@0003
@000C@0012Blast it...@0003
@0009@0014
Ever since Sigune's defeat,@0003
Ilia's militia has been hesitant
to attack the Etrurian Army.@0003
@000C@0080@000D
Cowards! Every last one of them!@0003
The great High Chancellor Roartz will
not die in this miserable wasteland!@0003
[01A1]
@0009@0010@0194@0012@0017Cough...cough...@0003
@000C@0010@0127@0014Are you all right?
Here, take my shawl.@0003
@0009@0013I couldn't.
You'll freeze...@0003
@000C@0014@0017I can handle it.
I'm used to these temperatures.@0003
This is nothing compared to
flying through a blizzard.@0003
@0009@0013...Thank you.
Cough...cough...@0003@0011@0005
@0009@0010@0191@0017Lady Juno...
What's going to happen?@0003
@000C@0014@0017...I don't know.
But we must stay hopeful.@0003
The enemy may retreat, or
perhaps Zelot might return.@0003
This isn't the end.@0003
@0009@0013@0017...Where is Sir Zelot now?@0003
@000C@0014
His last letter said he planned to join
the Lycian Army, but after that...@0003
@0017Well, he may be closer than
we realize.@0003
@0009@0013@0017I hope you're right.@0003
[01A2]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017...We fight again today.@0003
@000CYes, we must.@0003
Once we take this castle,@0003
it will be our new base
before we enter Bern.@0003
@0009...I see.@0003
@000CPrincess...@0003
May I ask why your father tried
to murder King Zephiel?@0003
@0009...Zephiel and I have different mothers.
In actuality, I am his half sister.@0003
@000CI heard that Zephiel's mother
was an Etrurian noblewoman.@0003
@0009That's correct.@0003
They were arranged to be wed for
political reasons.@0003
However, our father was already
in love with another woman.@0003
That was my mother.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016
The marriage between the king and
Zephiel's mother was forced.@0003
Our father didn't love Zephiel's
mother and always resented their son.@0003
@000C
Was that the cause of all
the troubles that happened?@0003
@0009No...@0003
I remember Zephiel working hard,
vying for our father's affection.@0003
He was a brilliant scholar and a
prodigy in combat.@0003
He grew to become a fine heir
to Bern's throne.@0003
@000C@0080@000DThen why did the
king try to--@0003
@000DLord Roy!
We are ready for the attack!@0003
@000BUnderstood.
I only need a moment!@0003
@0002Princess Guinivere,
I am sorry, but I...@0003
@0009No, I understand. Go.
Please be careful.@0003
[01A3]
@000C@0010@012C@0017Brrrr!@0003
I knew Ilia was cold, but I
didn't think it was THIS cold!@0003
And there's just snow
everywhere you look!@0003
@0017The pure white...
It's beautiful in a way...@0003
Whoops, no time to admire
the scenery.@0003
I'm here for the moolah...@0003
[01A4]
@000A@0010@0102@0017The blizzard is picking up...@0003
This might take longer than
we expected.@0003
We should head for Bern as soon
as we take the castle.@0003
[01A5]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0129
@000C@0013Sister! Juno!@0003
@0009Shanna? What are
you doing here?@0003
@000C@0014I'm with the Etrurian Army.@0003
I was surprised when I heard
Edessa was taken by Bern,@0003
but I knew you'd be OK.@0003
@0009@0012Oh? Why do you say that?@0003
@000C@0014You were a captain of the
pegasus knights!@0003
There's no way Bern could
defeat you.@0003
@0009Well, you'll be sorry to hear
that I was captured.@0003
@000C@0012@0017That's...@0003
@0009@0014@0017
But I don't intend to surrender
to Bern.@0003
All I could do on my own was try to
keep the people in the castle safe,@0003
but if I join you, I actually stand
a fighting chance against Bern.@0003
@000CThen are you going to
fight with us?@0003
@0009@0012Of course.@0003
@000C@0013Really? Hurray!@0003
@0009What's so exciting
about that?@0003
@000C@0014
I became a pegasus knight because
I wanted to be just like you.@0003
Fighting alongside you is like
a dream come true.@0003
@0009Really? I'm honored...@0003
You always have tended to
go overboard with things...@0003
[01A6]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0128
@000C@0012@0017Juno!@0003
@0009@0013Thea...
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0014@0017It's a long story...
But I'm with the Etrurian Army now.@0003
I'd heard that Edessa had fallen
to Bern so I was worried, but...@0003
I'm glad to see that you're
all right.@0003
@0009@0017...I'd heard that you were
fighting against this army.@0003@0002
You didn't betray...?@0003
@000CNo! Never!@0003
I never betrayed the code.@0003
I did everything I was
supposed to.@0003
I just eventually ended
up in the Etrurian Army.@0003
@0009@0017Of course...@0003
You're a good and diligent soldier.
I should have known better.@0003
I'm sorry.@0003
@000CNo, it's all right...@0003
But, um...
What are you wearing?@0003
@0009This?@0003
Why, this is my combat uniform.
Don't you remember it?@0003
What do you think?@0003
Think I can still make a
decent captain?@0003
@000C@0013@0017Of course, but I
thought you retired.@0003
@0009@0014@0017With such dire stakes I had no
choice but to come out of retirement.@0003
On my own all I could do was
defend the people in the castle,@0003
but if I join you, I can actually
strike back against Bern.@0003
@000C@0017Then you're going to
fight alongside us?@0003
@0009@0012@0017Yes, that's what
I'm getting at.@0003
@000C@0014That makes me so happy!@0003
I never thought I'd be able to
fight alongside you again.@0003
@0009Don't get ahead of yourself.@0003
You still have a long way
to catch up to me!@0003
[01A7]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0132
@000C@0012@0017Juno!@0003
@0009@0017Zelot!@0003
@000C@0014@0017Are you all right?
You're not hurt?@0003
If any of them laid a
finger on you, I'll--@0003
@0009@0017Oh, Zelot, I'm not a child.
I used to be a captain, you know.@0003
@000C@0013@0017I know,
but...@0003
@0009@0014@0017I'm fine.
They didn't do anything to me.@0003
@000C@0013Good...@0003
@0009@0014@0017Why are you in the
Etrurian Army?@0003
I thought you were
with Lycia.@0003
@000CWell, it's a long story...@0003
What it comes down to is that this
is the Etrurian Army only in name.@0003
It's actually made up primarily of
soldiers from the Lycian Army.@0003
@0009@0013Oh... Interesting.@0003
@000CI'm sorry I wasn't here
when you needed me most...@0003
@0009There is no use for
regret at this point.@0003
@000C@0013But you were forced
to fight...@0003
@0009@0014Oh? I thought you liked
my combat uniform.@0003
@000C@0013I do!
But...@0003
@0009@0014@0017Then what's the problem?@0003
You'll be seeing a lot
more of it from now on...@0003
@000C@0013@0017What?!
Do you mean...@0003
@0009@0017I do.@0003
I will fight
alongside you.@0003
@000C@0014@0017No! I can't accept that.
You retired years ago.@0003
Leave the fighting
to us...@0003
@0009I may have retired, but I still had to
take up arms to defend the castle.@0003
Zelot, this world isn't safe anymore.@0003
@000C@0013Well...@0003
@0009@0014@0017I will fight.@0003
I want to bring peace back
to this land.@0003

[01AB]
@0010@013D@0017S-someone!
Come to my aid!@0003@0002
All is lost if I fall!@0003
[01AC]
@0010@013D@0017W-wait... Serve me!
It is not too late...@0003
I shall...absolve you
of your crimes...@0003@0002
Guh...!@0003
[01AD]
@000C@0010@0102@0013@0017Next is Bern...@0003
@0009@0010@0154@0014Lord Roy!@0003
Many of Bern's troops have been
spotted in the ruins outside Edessa!@0003
@000C@0012Ruins?@0003
@0009@0014
Reports say the ruins are home to a
lance that was used in the Scouring.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@000B@0013That lance...
Is it...?@0003
@0009It is most probably a
legendary weapon.@0003
@000BThen we must hurry
to the ruins!@0003
[01AE]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Princess Guinivere, the attack
on Bern will commence soon.@0003
So may I ask...?@0003
@0009...The rest of the story.@0003
@000C
You said King Zephiel was an outstanding
pupil in everything he did...@0003
It sounds like he would have been an
ideal heir to the throne.@0003
@0009Yes, I have no doubt.@0003
@000C@0014
But still your father never
looked kindly at him.@0003
@0009In truth...our father began to despise
Zephiel precisely because of his talent.@0003
@000C@0012Why...would a father resent
his own son's talent...?@0003
@0009@0014
Our father was a man of
unextraordinary skill and intellect.@0003
Zephiel's outstanding talents made
our father colder towards him.@0003
@000C@0012He was envious...?@0003
@0009@0014
He went as far as to tell Zephiel
that he would never inherit Bern.@0003
He said that instead, the throne
would go to my future husband.@0003
@000C@0013His own father told him that?!
What a heartless man!@0003
@0009@0014But Zephiel held strong.@0003
He always said he never cared about
inheriting the throne.@0003
But the people of Bern knew of
Zephiel's genius and wanted him king.@0003
Pressured by the public, our father
lost his patience at last...@0003
@000C@0013That's when he decided
to kill Zephiel...?@0003
@0009@0014Our father gave Zephiel a goblet full
of a poisoned drink at a banquet.@0003
That was the first and last time Zephiel
ever accepted a drink from our father.@0003
After returning to his room, Zephiel
began to fall dreadfully ill.@0003
For ten days and nights, Zephiel
lingered between life and death.@0003
But Murdock, Zephiel's teacher and
loyal general, saved his life.@0003
@000C...The old king made no further
attempts on his life?@0003
@0009No. At least, not to completion...@0003
I have heard that he schemed to have
Murdock and Zephiel's mother killed.@0003
He was scheming to murder everyone
connected to Zephiel.@0003
Upon learning of our father's intentions,
Zephiel feigned death.@0003
At his funeral service, our father leaned
over the coffin to view Zephiel's body.@0003
It was at that moment that Zephiel sprung
from the coffin and...sword in hand...@0003

@0010@0127Thea, Shanna,@0005
are you ready?@0003@0002
@0017Triangle Attack!!@0003
[01B0]
@0010@0128Juno, Shanna,@0005
get ready!@0003@0002
@0017Triangle Attack!!@0003
[01B1]
@0010@0129Juno, Thea!@0005
Let's go!@0003@0002
@0017Triangle Attack!@0003
[01B2]
@0008@0010@0194@000A@0010@0191@000C@0010@0157
@000A@0017Excuse me...@0003
@000CYes...?@0003
@000AAre you the one who saved us?@0003
@000CEr, well, I...@0003
@000A@0017Thank you!@0003
It's only thanks to you that
we're alive and have our freedom.@0003
Please accept this token of our
gratitude.@0003@001C
@0008@0017Thank you again!@0003
@0008@0011@000A@0011@001C
@000C@0006@0016......@0003@0016@0002
I'll give this to Roy...@0003
[01B3]
@0008@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0147
@0008@0017@0013
General Murdock. All troops are
at their posts and ready for battle.@0003
@000CGood. Thank you.@0003@0008@0011@0002@0009@0010@0136
@000CGalle.
It will begin soon.@0003
@0009@0014My men are ready.@0003
@000C
Your squad will be the key to
victory in this battle.@0003
Do you understand?@0003
@0009@0013Of course, Sir Murdock.
I won't disappoint you.@0003
@000C@0014I expect not.@0003
@0017The enemy are but insects next
to the might of Bern's army.@0003
Even so...that Lycian general
has made it far.@0003
@0009@0013General Roy?@0003
@000C@0014Yes. Roy.@0003
I hope to be able to duel him in
a fair fight, one on one.@0003
[01B4]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@0102@0009@0013@0017Ah, General Roy!
I have found you at last.@0003
@000C@0014@0017Father Yoder!@0003
What brings you all
the way from Etruria?@0003
Is something amiss?@0003
@0009@0017@0080@0004
I did some additional research
after reading your letter.@0003
I reached the same conclusion. Bern
has resurrected the demon dragon.@0003
@000C@0013You think so, too?@0003
...Hartmut defeated the
demon dragon in the Scouring.@0003
How could Bern have brought
it back to life?@0003
@0009@0014
Apparently after defeating it,
Hartmut chose to spare its life.@0003
@000C@0012What?!@0003
@0009@0014
Instead of killing it, he sealed
it away in the mountains of Bern.@0003
The sword he used to seal it was...@0003
@000C@0013The Binding Blade?@0003
@0009@0014Oh, you know of it?@0003
@000C@0013I learned a little bit
of it in my studies...@0003
@0009@0014
The demon dragon's seal may have been
broken, but with the Binding Blade,@0003
we may be able to seal it away once
more or kill it for good.@0003
@000C
Do you know where the
demon dragon might be?@0003
@0009
Yes, I believe so.@0003
We know dragons change into
human form,@0003
and the demon dragon is most
likely in such a form as well.@0003
I have a suspect already.@0003
The "Dark Priestess" that is
always at King Zephiel's side.@0003
@000C@0013The Dark Priestess...@0003
@0009@0014
There is no solid evidence that
she is the demon dragon,@0003
but she appeared shortly before
the other dragons did.@0003
@000C@0012@0016......@0003
@0009@0014@0016
The dragons seal away their power
in gems called dragonstones.@0003
Remaining in their dragon form
uses too much energy otherwise.@0003
The same is likely true for
the demon dragon as well.@0003
@000C
We must see her in person
and find the truth.@0003
@0009Allow me to go with you.@0003
@000C@0013@0017
You will fight alongside us?
By all means!@0003
@0009@0014
I have also been instructed
to give you these.@0003
They are legendary weapons
that the church located.@0003
@000C@0012@0017Legendary weapons?!
These will be invaluable!@0003
@0009@0014
If the demon dragon has been released,@0003
then this is the greatest crisis
mankind has faced since the Scouring.@0003
@000CWe must rise like the Eight Legends
of yore to save humanity once again.@0003
[01B5]
@000C@0010@0136
@0017
Knights of Bern!
We strike now!@0003
Leave none alive!@0003
Don't even leave them
time to scream in fear!@0003
[01B6]
@000C@0010@01C7@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0017
Have you dealt with the
legendary weapon?@0003
@0009Yes sir, it has
been disposed of.@0003
@000CGood.@0003
Now we go to General
Murdock's aid!@0003
[01B7]
@0009@0010@0136@000C@0010@012E@0017Galle...@0003
@0009Melady...@0003
@000CGalle...
I...@0003
@0009Do not speak...@0003
You and I are both
loyal knights.@0003
We both fight in our
masters' names.@0003
That is all there is
to know.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009Melady...@0003
This is probably the end,
so let me say this.@0003
I am truly grateful I was
fortunate enough to meet you.@0003
We trained together, and we
fought alongside each other.@0003
Melady...
The days I spent with you...@0003
They were the happiest days
of my life.@0003
@000C
M...mine, too...@0003
@0009...Good-bye, Melady.@0003
My only regret is that we didn't
meet in a more peaceful time.@0003
@000CGalle...@0003@0009@0011@0006
@000C@0080@000DWait!@0003
Galle!@0003
Don't go!@0003
Gaaalle!!@0003
[01B8]
@0009@0010@0136@000C@0010@012A
@000C@0017Sir Galle...@0003
@0009Zeiss.
You seem to be well.@0003
@000CSir Galle...
Must we truly fight?@0003
@0009Yes.
We must.@0003
@000C
I...I don't want to
fight you!@0003
You're the last
person I ever...@0003
@0009Zeiss!
Are you a child?!@0003
@000CWhat...?!@0003
@0009
Did you have this little faith in
your choice when you left Bern?@0003
Do you regret your decision to
fight against Bern?@0003
@000C
No! My mind is...set...@0003
It still hurts to point my blade
towards Bern, my homeland...@0003
But the path I chose was not
a mistake...!@0003
@0009
Then cast away your hesitation!@0003
Focus on defeating those who block
the path that you have chosen.@0003@0002
...No matter who that may be.@0003
@000CSir Galle...@0003
@0009Zeiss...
Are you a knight of Bern?@0003
@000C...Of course!@0003
@0009Good!@0003
Then when next we meet,
there will be no words.@0003
Our blades will cross, and
one will be left standing!@0003
[01B9]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010E
@000CAh, Father Yoder.@0003
@0009
Saul, it is good to see
you well.@0003
And thank you.@0003
You and Dorothy have done a
great service to the church.@0003
@000C
...There is no greater pleasure
than to know I have been of use.@0003
@0009
Oh? I've never known you
to be so serious...@0003
@000CFather Yoder, despite all
appearances, I am a priest.@0003
The common good is my
greatest concern.@0003
@0009
I am sorry I doubted you.@0003
From this point, we
fight together.@0003
[01BA]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010C
@0009Dorothy,
have you been well?@0003
@000CVery much so.@0003
It is good to see
you, Father Yoder.@0003
@0009
You are always so cheery and
full of energy.@0003
I'm sure Saint Elimine
adores that about you.@0003
@000CDo you think so...?@0003
@0009
Just being around you cleanses the
heart and makes one feel pure.@0003
I'm sure that's true even for Saul.
You have much to be proud of.@0003
@000CThank you,
Father Yoder!@0003
[01BB]
@000C@0012@0016......@0003
@0009@0014@0016@0017I was but a child then, so naturally
I could not understand what was going on.@0003
All I knew at the time is that our father
died, and Zephiel never smiled again.@0003
Before then, he was stern at times,
but always a kind and loving brother.@0003
But after everything that happened...@0003
@000C@0012Princess...@0003
@0009@0014I knew that someday I may
have to act against him.@0003
@000C@0013I...see...@0003@0080@0004
@0009@0014...Zephiel is so far-gone now.
He will never listen to anything I say.@0003
Roy, please...
You must stop him.@0003
Stop him from destroying Bern and
from destroying Elibe.@0003
@000CSuch a feat will likely
require my blade.@0003
Can you still ask such
a thing of me?@0003
@0009...I trust your judgment.
Do what you must.@0003
@000C
You have my word,
Princess Guinivere.@0003
I swear by the Fire Emblem
that I will stop King Zephiel!@0003
[01BC]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015D@0017
You're the Etrurian Army,
aren't you?@0003
There are no soldiers
here.@0003
Take this. Just leave
us in peace!@0003
[01BD]
@0010@0147
Hm...
You have made it far.@0003@0002
I congratulate you.
But can you defeat me?@0003
[01BE]
@0010@0147
Hngh...!
You...are strong...@0003@0002
@0017Zephiel... My king...@0003
I cannot protect you...
any further...@0003
Forgive me...!@0003
[01BF]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017
Lord Roy... There is a path
leading underground here.@0003
@000C
Is the Binding Blade
down that way?@0003
@0009I cannot say...@0003
But a captive tells us that there
are two weapons in this shrine.@0003
@000CWait, is that right?@0003
Does that mean that there
is another legendary weapon?@0003
@0009Possibly...@0003
Perhaps we should ask those in
our army who hail from Bern.@0003
@000C@0013
Yes, I'll see if
they know anything.@0003
[01C0]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Lord Roy.
This sword in the altar...@0003
@000C@0013This must be the Binding Blade.@0003
@0009@0011@000A@0010@0154@0014
...I can't seem to draw it from the stone.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@000BIt's sealed in the altar.
We must use the Fire Emblem.@0003
@000AUse it? How?@0003
@000B
Princess Guinivere said that it goes
in the socket on the hilt...@0003@0080@0004
@000B@0011@000B@0010@0102@0012Whoa!
What's happening...?@0003
@000A@0080@000BThe blade is glowing!@0003
@000BNow I should be able
to draw it...!@0003
@0002@0016......!...@0017@0003@0016
[01C1]
@000B@0010@0102
@0006@0017...What...
are these images...?@0003@0006
Are they the
Binding Blade's...@0003@0006@0002
No, Hartmut's
memories...?@0003
@0009@0010@014A@0006@0011@000B@0002@0016!@0003
@0016@0002Who was that?@0003@0006@0002
I don't understand what
I'm feeling. It's very...@0017@0003
[01C2]
@0009@0010@0154@000B@0010@0102
@0009@0017Lord Roy?
Are you all right?@0003
@000BYes...
I'm fine.@0003@0002
So this is Hartmut's sword,
the Binding Blade...@0003
Am I really worthy to
wield it...?@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@012B@0014
It is said that truly magnificent
swords choose their owners.@0003
The sword is in your hands now.
It has chosen you.@0003
@000B@0013
But anyone with the Fire Emblem
could have taken it...@0003
@0008@0014
In theory, perhaps so...@0003
But it was you who reached it.
This is fate.@0003
@000B@0016......@0003@0016@001C
@000A@0010@0154
Now that we have the Binding Blade,
all that's left is the king of Bern.@0003
We mustn't tarry!@0003@001C
@000B...You're right!
Zephiel must be stopped!@0003
[01C3]
@0009@0010@0148@000C@0010@0149
@000C@0017What you're saying, then...
is that Murdock is dead...@0003
@0009@0012...I am sorry,
Your Majesty.@0003
@000C@0014What is the Etrurian
Army's next move?@0003
@0009They have captured the Shrine of Seals.
They march this way.@0003
@000CVery well...@0003
Then we face them
in the castle.@0003
@0009@0013Yes, my king.
My life is yours.@0003
@000C@0014
No. You cannot die here,
Brunnya.@0003
I have a task of grave
importance for you.@0003@0009@0012@0016...?@0003@0016
@000C@0014Idunn!
Where are you, Idunn?@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@014B@0012...Here, Your Majesty.@0003
@000C@0014
I will remain here and defend the
castle against the Etrurian Army.@0003
You must escape to safety and stay
hidden until the battle is over.@0003
@0008@0013As Your Majesty wills.@0003@0011@0009@0010@0148
@000C@0014
Brunnya, you will
guard Idunn.@0003
Protect her as you
would protect me.@0003
@0009@0080@000C
No, Your Majesty!
Please!@0003
Allow me to fight
by your side!@0003
@000CThat is something I
cannot do.@0003
...This will be a harsh battle,
and Idunn must survive.@0003
If she is lost...this entire
struggle has been for nothing.@0003
@000A@0013I must object, Your Majesty!
I serve you and you alone...@0003
@000C@0014Enough, Brunnya!
Your king orders you.@0003
The punishment for
defiance is execution.@0003
@000A@0080@000B@0009@0013Yes...Your Majesty...@0003@0011@0008@0010@014B
@000C@0014
Idunn, if I fall...@0003
The plan continues.@0003
@0008As you will...@0003
The world will be liberated
as per Your Majesty's command.@0003
@000CGood. Then my dream
will be fulfilled.@0003
@0008@0012Of course, Your Majesty.@0003
[01C4]
@0009@0010@01D7@0017The Etrurian Army...@0003
I will not let you into
the throne room!@0003
[01C5]
@000C@0010@01D7@0017I shall protect this
switch with my life!@0003
[01C6]
@000C@0010@0102
@0017@0013This is the king's castle...@0003
@0009@0010@0154@0014
Lord Roy, Zephiel is in the throne
room in the center of the castle.@0003
However, the entryway to the throne
is blocked off by automatic defenses.@0003
@000C@0012What can be done?@0003
@0009@0014
One of the captives said that
at either end of the castle,@0003
there are some switches that can
be manipulated to open the way.@0003
@000CThat will be a long detour...@0003
@0009There is more.@0003
After hitting the switches,@0003
one must hold the Fire Emblem in front
of the throne room to make it open.@0003
@000CI have the Fire Emblem with me.@0003@0002
It sounds like I should go to the throne
room while others handle the switches...@0003
@0009That would be the quickest way.@0003
@000C
...But would a captive leak that
kind of information so easily?@0003
Perhaps it's a trap...@0003
@0009I don't believe so.@0003
The captive said the switches are
protected by Bern's ablest warriors.@0003
Even with this information, it will
be no easy feat.@0003
@000CThe enemy may be powerful, but we're
not exactly slouches, either.@0003
I know we're up for the challenge!
Victory will be ours!@0003
[01C7]
@000C@0010@012C
Castle Bern... A worthy target
for the Master Thief.@0003
I'm sure there's mountains of
gold hidden in here somewhere!@0003
[01C8]
@000C@0010@FFFF
@0017Is this the switch?
Nothing's happening...@0003
[01C9]
@000C@0010@FFFF
@0017Is this the switch?
Nothing's happening...@0003
[01CA]
@0009@0010@0149@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017You've come.@0003
Hmph... It's laughable, really.
A mere child making it so far.@0003
@000CZephiel...
King of Bern...@0003
@0080@000D@000B
Why did you start this war?@0003
@0009...I wish to end the
Age of Man.@0003
@000B@0080@000E@0012...I don't understand.@0003
@0009@0014
Humans...are filthy and despicable
creatures.@0003
They flock to the promise of power
like hideous, hairless sheep,@0003
and they stab trusted allies
while their backs are turned.@0003
I'm certain you have witnessed as much
even from many who claim to serve me.@0003
@000C@0016@0012......@0003@0016
@0009Jealousy. Hatred. Greed.@0003
Friends and family are driven to murder
one another by these petty emotions.@0003
Such emotions spawn fathers who would
even kill their own brood.@0003
As long as humans control,
as long as humans exist,@0003
this madness will never end.@0003
@000C@0080@000D@000B
But consider what you've done!@0003
You've become exactly that
which you despise!@0003
@0009...Do you know how
the Scouring ended?@0003
@000BThe demon dragon was
defeated by Hartmut...@0003
@0009Yes. It was history's greatest mistake.
Mankind should not have won.@0003
Humans perverted this world into an
ordurous cesspool of madness and evil.@0003
All through their illogical and
contemptible emotions!@0003
@000B@0016@0012......@0003
@0009@0016@0014
Mistakes cannot be left uncorrected.@0003
I will liberate the world from the grasp
of man and return it to the dragons.@0003
The slate will be wiped clean.
History will be rewritten.@0003
It is the only way to free the
world from everlasting agony!@0003
@000BIs it true that you
resurrected the demon dragon?@0003
@0009@0013There is no need to answer that. You
will know for yourself before long.@0003
@000B@0014You said you intend to give the
world to the dragons.@0003
How would rule by dragons be
any different?@0003
@0009The dragons you have seen are
weapons for battle.@0003
They have no self.@0003
They lack reprehensible emotions
to drive them, unlike humans.@0003
The dragons' rule will be
just and peaceful.@0003
@000BSuch a world can't be
a better alternative!@0003
Some humans may commit
terrible atrocities,@0003
but it has always been other
humans who have stopped them!@0003
@0009@0013@0017Your naivety amuses me.@0003
@000B@0080@000E@0014@0017@000C
You have lost faith in humanity
and in yourself.@0003
I believe in mankind, and I know
that your lunacy must be stopped!@0003
[01CB]
@0010@0149@0017You shall not bar my path!@0003
[01CC]
@0010@0149@0017...I am defeated...@0003@0002
But remember this...@0003
My will shall never die...@0003
As long as humans retain
control, madness will reign...@0003
[01CD]
@000B@0010@0102@0017Zephiel has fallen...@0003@001C
@000D@0010@0154We've done it,
Lord Roy.@0003@001C
@0009@0010@012B...Or have we?@0003@001C
@000DWhat?@0003@001C
@000BWhat do you mean?@0003
@0009The Dark Priestess is
nowhere to be found...@0003@001C
@000D...She must have
escaped.@0003@001C
@000B...So it seems.@0003
[01CE]

[01CF]
@001C@000D@0017What...?@0005
What was that?@0003@001C
@000BZephiel's sword...
it's glowing!@0003
It's...@0003
@0009Eckesachs...@0003
A sword that only the
king of Bern can use...@0003
@001C@000DLord Roy, legend says that when all
the legendary weapons come together,@0003
the Dragon Sanctuary will rise from
the ground!@0003@001C
@000BThe Dragon Sanctuary...@0003
@000DIt was the headquarters
and lair of the dragons...@0003
That's what the legends
say, anyway.@0003
@0009Yes...
I've heard that, too.@0003
@000BDoes that mean Eckesachs is
the final legendary weapon?@0003
I thought it was the
Binding Blade.@0003
@0009...The Binding Blade may be on an even
higher level than the legendary weapons...@0003
It may be its own entity, beyond compare
to even the legendary weapons...@0003
@000BMore powerful than the legendary weapons...?
What power lies in this sword?@0003
[01D0]
@001C@000D@0017The sword is glowing again!@0003
The light is pointing
to the south!@0003@001C
@0080@0004
@000B
Will the light lead us
to the Dragon Sanctuary?@0003
@001C@000D
That is how the
stories go.@0003@001C
@0009
...If the Dark Priestess is the
demon dragon as we suspect...@0003
then she is most likely at
the sanctuary...@0003
@000BVery well.
We follow the light!@0003
[01D1]
@0009@0011@000B@0011@000D@0011
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Zephiel...@0003
@000C...Princess Guinivere.@0003
@0009I'm sorry...
I need some time alone.@0003@0011
@000C@0080@000DPrincess...!@0003
@001C@000D@0010@0154Lord Roy...
You should leave her be.@0003@001C
@0009@0010@012B...An admirable job.@0003
@000BElffin!@0003
@0017...Thank you.@0003
Your homeland is in turmoil...
yet you chose to help us.@0003
You've been an asset
to us all...@0003
@0009...I'm afraid I don't know what you
mean by my "homeland"...@0003
But it was my greatest pleasure to
assist you.@0003
@000BI'll never be able
to repay this.@0003@0009@0011@0002@0005
@000B@0013@0017...Control by humans...@0003
@000D@0011@0009@0010@0154Are you thinking of
Zephiel's final words?@0003
He may have been right...
in a way.@0003
@000B...Has the Dark Priestess
been found?@0003
@0009@0014Unfortunately not...@0003
She apparently disappeared
before the battle.@0003
@000B@0080@000EIs that so...@0003
Do you really think she could
be the demon dragon?@0003
@0009
It is difficult to say
without even seeing her.@0003
It will be near impossible
to locate her now.@0003
She is always clad in a black robe
and none have seen her up close.@0003
@000CThat's unfortunate... But so be it.@0003
The battle is over.
That's cause enough for celebration.@0003
@0009I think not, milord!
The hardest part has yet to come.@0003
The land must be nursed back to
health now that the war is over.@0003
There are countless people in
need of our assistance.@0003
@000CYou're right!
We have work to do.@0003
The real battle is
only just beginning.@0003
We must look to the future.@0003@0017
No matter what hardships we may face,
we must never give up.@0003
We must prove that a land of beauty
and peace from human hands is possible!@0003
@0009@0013
I live to serve you, Lord Roy!@0003@0002
Now, let us make our way home.@0003
We must spread the word of
our victory!@0003

@0009@0010@014C@000C@0010@0148
@0017Sir Jahn, Idunn is here.
I leave her in your care.@0003
@0009@0013
And what about you, human?
What will you do now?@0003
@000C
I will stay here. I will face the
Etrurian Army...and my destiny.@0003
@0009@0012Do you have sufficient troops?@0003
@000C@0014
The wyvern riders scattered around
the continent have returned to us.@0003
@0009Do you have any chance
of victory?@0003
@000C
...Our chance of victory is
minuscule at best.@0003
But we are the Bern Army, the
strongest force in Elibe.@0003
If nothing else, we shall show
them our unwavering will.@0003
@0009Your will...?@0003
You humans are incomprehensible
to us at times.@0003
Do you expect your will alone
to earn you victory?@0003
But so be it.@0003
I leave you to your irrational
pursuit.@0003
[01E9]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0148@000C@0013@0017...Have you given the
troops my message?@0003
@0009@0014Yes, General Brunnya.@0003
I told them they are free
to leave if they so wish.@0003
@000C@0013How many remain?@0003
@0009@0014Nearly all of the soldiers say they
still wish to fight for you.@0003
@000CNearly all of them?@0003
Victory is unlikely.@0003
I'm sure many of the troops have
family awaiting their return.@0003
I do not want any to feel that
they must fight on this day.@0003
@0009We are knights of Bern, General.@0003
We have no intention of bowing our
heads to Etruria.@0003
@000C...Dismiss the injured and those with
young children or elderly parents.@0003
They are forbidden from fighting
in this battle.@0003
@0009@0013But General Brunnya...@0003
@000CThat is an order.
Go.@0003
[01EA]
@000C@0017
Why didn't it slay Idunn?@0003
@0009
The blade has a strange power that
reflects the wielder's soul.@0003
@000C
Hartmut didn't want to kill her,@0003
so the Binding Blade reflected
that feeling and spared her...@0003
@0009
He had apparently heard how the demon
dragon was formed and felt pity for it.@0003
We dragons cannot understand that
illogical feeling.@0003
@000C
He pitied her...@0003
@0009
In his soul, he wished to spare Idunn.@0003
I personally would never hesitate to
eliminate a threat as he did.@0003
@000C
Hartmut's soul changed the
sword itself...@0003
@0009
After persuading the others that it
should be spared,@0003
Hartmut built a shrine hidden deep
in what you now call Bern.@0003
There, he bound the demon dragon away
using the blade and the Fire Emblem.@0003
After the founding of Bern,@0003
the shrine was protected by the royal
family for generations.@0003
That is, until Zephiel unbound her,
of course.@0003
@000C
...How do you know all this?
Did you witness it?@0003
@0009
No. After the battle I hid myself
to nurse my wounds.@0003
All I just told you I learned
from Zephiel himself,@0003
who read it in ancient tomes kept
by the Bern royal family.@0003
@000C
...How did you meet Zephiel?@0003
@0009
You wish to know that now,
do you?@0003
So be it... Come further,
and I will tell you.@0003
[01EB]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017
Lord Roy, the troops
are prepared.@0003
@000C@0013...Did the messenger return?@0003
@0009@0014Yes, but as expected, the
enemy refuses to surrender.@0003
@000C
Was it clear that their safety would
be guaranteed if they surrender?@0003
@0009Yes, but even given that information,
they apparently politely refused.@0003
@000CWhy do they fight?
Bern's king is defeated...@0003
@0009@0011@000A@0010@0157@0016......@0003@0016
@000CPrincess Guinivere...@0005
Do you understand why?@0003
@000AI do very well.@0003
...Bern recognizes itself as
the strongest force in Elibe.@0003
Their pride does not allow them to
accept defeat without a fight.@0003
@000C@0012@0016......@0003@0016
@0008@0010@0154@0013Lord Roy!
The enemy is advancing!@0003
@000C@0014
...They leave us no choice.
We must fight!@0003
Merlinus, send Princess
Guinivere to the back lines...@0003@0008@0011
@000ANo. I will stay here.@0003
I...must listen to their cries.@0003
That is all I can do to atone
for my betrayal...@0003
[01EC]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0113@0012@0017Uncle Karel!@0003
@0009@0013@0017Ah, Fir...
Fancy meeting you here.@0003
@000C@0017Wh-what are you doing
in a place like this?@0003
@0009@0014@0017
I live here.@0003
After all my travels around the
world, I decided to settle here.@0003
@000C@0017
Uncle... I must tell
you something.@0003
Mother... She...@0003
@0009@0012Your father told me.@0003
I'm sorry I couldn't
be with you.@0003
I'm sure it must have
been difficult...@0003
@000C@0012......@0003
[01ED]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0120@0017@0013K-Karel!@0003
@0009@0014@0017...Bartre?@0003
What are you doing
here?@0003
@000C@0013@0017I fight with the Etrurian Army...
What about you, Karel?@0003
@0009@0014@0017
I live here.@0003
I've traveled enough.
It was time to settle down.@0003
@000C@0017Karel...
I must tell you something.@0003
@0009@0012About Karla?@0003
@000C...You already know?@0003
@0009Fir told me.@0003
@000CI beg your forgiveness!
I could do nothing...@0003
@0009@0014I don't blame you.
It is I who should apologize.@0003
If only I could have been
there with you...@0003
@000C@0012@0016......@0003
[01EE]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0102
@0009Are you Roy?@0003
@000CWho are you?@0003
@0009I am Karel.@0003
I have decided to
assist your army.@0003
@000CYou're the Sword Saint...
Your skills are legendary.@0003
We welcome you.@0003
[01EF]
@0009@0010@0161@000C@0010@0112
@0009@0013@0017
S-Sir Karel!@0003
This place will be
a battlefield...@0003
@000C@0014
So I see.@0003
I thought I could be free of
war in this isolated land...@0003
@0009@0013What should we do?@0003
@000C@0014Please don't fret.
I will protect the village.@0003
@0009@0013Thank you, Sir Karel!@0003
You are truly worthy of the
title of Sword Saint!@0003
We have nothing to fear with
you protecting us.@0003
@000C@0014I am just an ordinary swordsman.@0003
Stories grow with time, so don't
trust all that you've heard...@0003@0002
...This war seems to be even
greater than I realized.@0003
I wonder how my sister Karla
fares...@0003
@0009@0013I never knew you had a sister.@0003
@000CI haven't seen her in years,
but she fell ill some time ago.@0003
I only hope she leads a peaceful
life with her husband and daughter...@0003
[01F0]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0113@0012@0017Uncle!@0003
@0009@0013@0017...Fir?
Is that you?@0003
What are you
doing here?@0003
@000C@0017I never expected to find
you here, Uncle.@0003
@0009@0014@0017
I've traveled enough. I decided it
was time to settle down.@0003
I had hoped to train my sword without
distractions in this quiet village...@0003
@000C@0017Uncle...
I must tell you something.@0003
Mother... She...passed on...@0003
@0009@0012...She's gone?@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009@0014@0016......@0003@0016
So she succumbed to
her illness...@0003
I'm sorry.@0003
I wasn't there when you
needed me the most.@0003
@000C@0012No... It's all right.@0003
@0009@0014But why are you here?@0003
Surely you haven't been searching
for me just to tell me that?@0003
@000C@0013Actually, I'm fighting
against Bern.@0003
@0009@0014You...joined the war?@0003
@000CI know that you dislike getting
caught up in conflicts like this.@0003
All I wanted was to help the people
who have suffered from this war.@0003
Uncle... Was I wrong? Was I
mistaken in joining this fight?@0003
Should I have found a better way
to train my sword...?@0003
@0009
No, you've made no
mistakes.@0003
A path you choose on your
own is never wrong.@0003
In fact, I think I'll
join you.@0003
@000C@0017Really?!@0003
@0009Absolutely.@0003
...You have grown so
much.@0003
The last time I saw you,
you couldn't even walk yet.@0003
@000CUncle...@0003
[01F1]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0120@0017@0013Karel?!@0003
@0009@0014@0017Bartre?
What are you doing here?@0003
@000C@0013@0017
I fight with
the Etrurian Army.@0003
I didn't expect to
see you here...@0003
@0009@0014@0017
I've traveled enough. I decided it
was time to settle down.@0003
I had hoped to train my sword without
distractions in this quiet village...@0003
@000C@0017...I have something I must
apologize for...@0003
@0009@0012...Are you talking about Karla?@0003
@000C@0014Yes...
I did all I could, but...@0003
@0009@0013She succumbed to her illness...?@0003
@000CForgive me!
I was too weak to save her...@0003
@0009@0014It is not your fault.
It is I who should apologize to you.@0003
I wasn't at her side when she
needed me the most...@0003
@000C@0012...I wish to ask you a favor.@0003
@0009What is it?@0003
@000CI want this battle to end.@0003
I know how you despise warfare...
but will you lend us your skills...?@0003
@0009@0017...So that's it.@0003
Very well.
You have my sword.@0003
@000CThank you, my brother!@0003
With your skills,
victory is as good as ours!@0003
[01F2]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0112
@0017This village has none who
wish to join your fight.@0003
Please leave us in peace.@0003
[01F3]
@0010@0148@0017Bern will never die!@0003
Even if I fall, Bern will
rise once more!@0003
[01F4]
@0010@0148@0017Your...Majesty...@0003
Let me be...by your side
again...like before...@0003
[01F5]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017This is the Dragon Sanctuary...
The Dark Priestess is in here?@0003
@0009Almost assuredly.
But...something is bothering me...@0003
@000C@0012What's that?@0003
@0009@0013
Legends of the Scouring say the Dragon
Sanctuary has the power of the dragons.@0003
@000CWhat does that mean?@0003
@0009The sanctuary's power is said to
protect the dragons themselves.@0003
@000CWhat...?
I don't understand.@0003
@0009
I believe the dragons in the sanctuary
may be more powerful than those outside.@0003
@000C
Do you think we still have
a chance against them?@0003
@0009Probably, but only with the
legendary weapons.@0003
@000C
...It is better to be safe than sorry.@0003
I'll take those of us who can wield
legendary weapons into the sanctuary.@0003
@0009Choose wisely.@0003
Once inside, we may be
unable to leave freely...@0003
[01F6]
@000C@0010@0102@0017This is the Dragon Sanctuary...
The air feels strange.@0003
Did the Eight Legends fight
under these conditions, too?@0003@0080@0004
@0009@0010@014C
You humans stand
against us once more.@0003
@000C@0080@000DWhat...?
Who are you?!@0003
When did you...?@0003
@0009@0014I am Jahn.@0003
I am the last true dragon
of the Dragon Sanctuary.@0003
@000B@0080@000E@0013The last true dragon?@0003
You do seem different from
the other dragons...@0003
Are you the demon dragon?@0003
@0009
The "dragons" you have fought
thus far are war dragons.@0003
They know nothing but battle.@0003
The demon dragon too is quite a
different being than I.@0003
I am a pure-blooded dragon who fought
you humans in the distant past.@0003
@000C
The demon dragon is a
different being?@0003
I thought the demon dragon
was the leader of your kind.@0003
@0009
The demon dragon is nothing more
than a tool to rally us dragons.@0003
It is hardly what I would call
a leader.@0003
@000CWhat?@0005 What exactly is
the demon dragon, then?@0003
@0009
There is much you don't know,
it appears.@0003
@000C
What is the demon dragon?@0003
I want to at least know what
it is we are fighting against!@0003
@0009Hrmm...@0003
I have no reason to tell you.@0003
But then, I have no reason
not to tell you, either.@0003
What to do?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009...Very well.@0003
A test. Are you worthy of
hearing the truth?@0003
I await you deep within.@0003
Fight through the hordes of
war dragons and come to me.@0003
Do that, and everything will
be made clear.@0003
@000CYou're deep within?
But you're right here!@0003
@0009
What you see is an illusion.
A projection.@0003
Come if you wish to know
the truth.@0003
Prove yourself worthy of my time
and I shall tell you all...@0003
[01F7]
@0009@0010@014C@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0013@0017
Is this really you
this time?@0003
Or...@0003
@0009
This is but the beginning.@0003
You have quite a way ahead
of you yet.@0003
But you didn't perish
immediately.@0003
That alone speaks to your
ability.@0003
@000C
We have been through
many trials.@0003
We will not die here
and let it be for naught.@0003
@0009So you say.@0003
Allow me to tell you a little
bit about the demon dragon.@0003
The demon dragon is not the leader
of the dragons as you thought.@0003
The demon dragon was created to
bring us victory.@0003
@000C@0080@000D
It was created...?@0003
So it wasn't the demon dragon
who was making dragons...?@0003
@0009
The "dragons" you speak of are in
fact soulless war dragons.@0003
As I said before, they are different
from pure dragons such as myself.@0003
The war dragons are indeed created
by the demon dragon.@0003
The demon dragon was formed from
a divine dragon,@0003
the most powerful of our kind.@0003
@000B
It was formed from a
divine dragon?@0003
Did a divine dragon agree to
become the demon dragon?@0003
@0009
Agree? Ha. No.@0003
We destroyed its very soul
to extinguish its will.@0003
It is a mindless drone intended
to heed our every word.@0003
@000B@0080@000EYou what...?!@0003
@0009
We desperately needed the
power of a divine dragon.@0003
The survival of our entire
species was at stake.@0003
@000C
You needed the power of a
divine dragon...@0003
So...you destroyed one's
soul?!@0003
@0009
Do you wish to
know more?@0003
Come further.@0003
Show me your
strength...@0003
[01F8]
@0009@0010@014C@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017
Not bad. Not bad at all.@0003
I'm curious how far you
will make it.@0003
@000C
I want to hear more.@0003
@0009
...No matter how many of your kind
we defeated in combat,@0003
you humans continued to multiply
endlessly.@0003
We were eventually overwhelmed
by the sheer number of you humans.@0003
It was then we decided to form a demon
dragon capable of creating war dragons.@0003
@000C
War dragons... Soulless beings
who know nothing but battle.@0003
@0009Correct.@0003
The divine dragons, however,
were opposed to the idea.@0003
They said it was an affront
to the laws of nature.@0003
As we tried to persuade
the divine dragons,@0003
they suddenly disappeared
without a trace.@0003
@000CWhy?@0003
@0009
They probably chose to leave before
we could take advantage of them.@0003
We never located the majority of
the divine dragon tribe,@0003
but we were able to capture a
single member of their kind.@0003
@000CAnd that became the
demon dragon?@0003
@0009Precisely.@0003
The divine dragon Idunn was to
become the demon dragon.@0003
It hesitated, however,@0003
as the rift between its tribe
and the rest of us widened.@0003
Hesitation... Such folly
is reserved for you humans.@0003
It serves no end.@0003
@000C
Her hesitation impeded
your plans...@0003
@0009
Idunn was immature, but of enough
strength to fulfill our purpose.@0003
Its heart, however, wasn't with us.
It would not follow our commands.@0003
@000C
So...that's why you
destroyed her soul...?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
We destroyed its soul so that it would
unquestioningly obey our every command.@0003
@000CThat's...vile...@0003
@0009That's enough for now.@0003
Show me more of your power if
you want to hear the rest!@0003
[01F9]
@0009@0010@014C@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0013@0017
You proceed at a good pace.
But you have not won yet.@0003
@000CRest assured, we
will reach you!@0003
@0009
Your soul is strong.@0003@0002
What do you wish to
hear next?@0003
@000C
You created the demon dragon.@0003
The demon dragon had the ability
to create endless war dragons.@0003
Why, then, did you lose to
the humans?@0003
@0009
The demon dragon created many war
dragons for use in the battlefield.@0003
The tables were turned.
Our victory was in sight.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009
However, the humans soon found out
about the demon dragon.@0003
They concluded that their numbers
were not enough to defeat us.@0003
They focused their efforts into forging
weapons that would pierce our scales.@0003
They are what you humans call the
legendary weapons.@0003
@000CThat much I know...@0003
@0009
The strongest human warriors were chosen
to wield their newly crafted weapons.@0003
They came and attacked this sanctuary.@0003
However, the immense power of the
weapons clashing with our own power...@0003
It caused something none of us had
anticipated.@0003
@000CWhat happened?@0003
@0009The laws of nature started to collapse.@0003
Snow began to fall in summer.
Stars shone in the middle of day...@0003
@000C
You mean it caused the Ending Winter?@0003
I thought it occurred because the dragons
released vast amounts of energy...@0003
@0009Is that how your legends go?@0003
@000CThe power of the legendary weapons
was used to restore order to nature.@0003
That's what I learned.@0003
@0009
So in other words, we were the cause
of everything bad that happened.@0003
How typical of you humans.@0003
But the truth is as I said.@0003
@000C
Then the legendary weapons were sealed
away to prevent another disaster...@0003
The traps that were protecting them
were meant to keep us out...@0003
@0009
You humans sealed them away?
An uncharacteristically good decision.@0003
But you seem to be wielding them now.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009I wouldn't worry.@0003
The weapons' potency seems to have
decreased since their initial forging.@0003
I doubt they can bring about another
such disaster as they are now.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009Anyway, the warping of nature's laws
dealt a great blow to us dragons.@0003
@000CHow?@0003
@0009
That disaster was the reason
we lost to the humans...@0003
I shall continue my story when
you advance a bit further...@0003
[01FA]
@0009@0010@014C@000C@0010@0102
@0009You have come far.
Perhaps I underestimated you.@0003
@000C@0017...Please continue the story.@0003
@0009
When the order of nature collapsed,
we dragons suffered the most.@0003
With nature weakened, we could not
maintain our dragon forms.@0003
And so, we sealed our power into
gemstones and took human form.@0003
@000CThe dragonstones...@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
We were utterly powerless against
the humans.@0003
In human form, we were even more
feeble than the humans themselves.@0003
The humans took the opportunity
to slaughter us.@0003
@000CWhy did you choose the form of humans?
Why not some other shape?@0003
@0009
In the new order of nature,@0003
the human form required the least
energy to transform into.@0003
The Eight Legends mercilessly crushed us
as we were helpless in our human form.@0003
I too suffered deep wounds.@0003
@000C
Do you hate the humans
because of that attack?@0003
@0009
Hate? Only humans feel such
preposterous emotions.@0003
We battled for survival
and we lost.@0003
There was nothing more to
our fight.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009
However, we may yet be
victorious.@0003
A human named Zephiel
resurrected the demon dragon.@0003
@000C@0080@000D
Then Zephiel really did undo
the demon dragon's seal!@0003
@0009@0017That is correct.@0003
Show me if you're
worthy to hear more.@0003
[01FB]
@000C@0010@0102@0013@0017
@000CJahn!
Where are you?@0003
@0009@0010@014CHm...@0003
I should have expected this of
the man who defeated Zephiel...@0003
You may even have the chance
to fight me personally.@0003
@000C
How did Zephiel know about
the demon dragon?@0003
@0009
Surely you know that Hartmut of
the Eight Legends founded Bern.@0003
@000C
I do.@0003
@0009
Do you also know that Hartmut
chose to spare the demon dragon?@0003
Rather than killing it, he
sealed it away.@0003
@000CYes, but I don't
know why.@0003
@0009
Hm... Let me explain.@0003
The Eight Legends defeated our leader,@0003
and made their way into the sanctuary
to find the demon dragon.@0003
However, arriving at its chamber, all
they found was a blank-eyed human girl.@0003
That was Idunn.@0003
@000C@0013She didn't fight?@0003
@0009@0014
The demon dragon had its soul destroyed
to follow our leader's commands.@0003
With our leader dead, there were no
commands to follow.@0003
@000CThen what happened?@0003
@0009
The Eight Legends naturally
hesitated.@0003
They had expected to find the
most terrible of all dragons,@0003
but instead they found a
mute girl.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009
Knowing the demon dragon still had to be
defeated, they readied their weapons.@0003
Idunn must have reacted to their
attack out of instinct.@0003
It changed into dragon form and fought
as the soulless war dragons do.@0003
Hartmut, however,@0003
brandished a blade even more powerful
than the legendary weapons.@0003
@000CThe Binding Blade!@0003
@0009
I don't know what you humans call it,
but that must be it.@0003
When the blade cut the demon dragon's
flesh,@0003
it fell unconscious rather
than dying.@0003
[01FC]
@0009@0010@014C@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017
You have come far.
I am in the next chamber.@0003
It has been ages since I've
shown a human my true form.@0003
I've not left this sanctuary
since the end of the Scouring.@0003
@000CY...you've been here
that long?@0003
@0009For one thousand years...@0003
Having survived the Scouring,
I waited, healing my wounds.@0003
I waited for the resurrection
of the demon dragon.@0003
For our chance of victory.@0003
At long last, that time came.@0003
The demon dragon's seal was
broken,@0003
and I felt power flowing
through my veins again.@0003
@000C
What does the demon dragon's seal
have to do with your strength?@0003
@0009
The Dragon Sanctuary's power is
intertwined with the demon dragon's.@0003
With the demon dragon sealed, the
sanctuary, and myself, were crippled.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
@0009
After I recovered, I sought the
person who had broken the seal.@0003
I used my illusions to seek him
out and ask his intentions.@0003
With you humans ruling the world,
I couldn't go in my true form.@0003
@000C
Wait... I thought that dragons lose
most of their power in human form.@0003
How do you have the power to create
illusions like this?@0003
@0009
This sanctuary is the only place that
dragons maintain some power in human form.@0003
I am also a relatively powerful dragon.@0003
Even in human form, as long as I am in this
sanctuary, illusions are a simple task.@0003
I lack the power to create war dragons
like the demon dragon can, however.@0003
[01FD]
@0010@014CI have waited a
millennium...@0003
My strength has recovered,
and it is greater than ever.@0003
I can feel it...@0003
[01FE]
@0010@014C@0017I fall...@0003
Humans are truly
unpredictable...@0003
[01FF]
@000C@0010@0102@0013@0017
The demon dragon
lies ahead...@0003
@0080@0004@0009@0010@0104...Roy...@0003
@000CWhat's wrong, Fae?@0003
You look like you're
about to cry.@0003
@0009Am...am I evil, too...?@0003
@000CHuh?@0003
@0009When...@0003
When I get older, will I
be a bad dragon, too?@0003
@000CSlow down, Fae.@0003
Where did you get
that idea?@0003
@0009
That man said that...dragons and
humans can't live in peace...@0003
@000C
That wasn't true. You've lived in
Nabata with humans, haven't you?@0003
@0009
But the demon dragon is a
divine dragon like me!@0003
You're going to fight the demon
dragon, but what about me?@0003
@0009
What if...when I grow up...
I'm like the demon dragon...?@0003
Then...you'd have to...@0003
@000C@0017
Don't worry, Fae.@0003
I know you'll never be like
the demon dragon.@0003
You'll always live with
humans. With people like me.@0003
@0009...Do you really
think so?@0003
@000COf course!@0003
I want to help the
demon dragon, too.@0003
@0009@0017Help her?@0003
@000C
The demon dragon isn't acting
of her own free will.@0003
She had her soul destroyed.
She is a slave.@0003
I...I don't want to kill
her if I can avoid it...@0003
@0009...Your words are too big.
I don't understand.@0003
@000C
I'm sure you'll learn what I mean
once you get a little older.@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0002
Hartmut posed a question when he
bound the demon dragon.@0003
And I intend to answer it!@0003
[0200]
@000C@0010@0102@0017The demon dragon is here...
Exercise caution, everyone.@0003
This is our last battle!@0003
[0201]
@0009@0010@014B@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0012@0016......@0003
@000C@0013@0016@0017You're the Dark Priestess...
The demon dragon.@0003
@0009@0014...Why do you block my path?@0003
@000C@0012What...?@0003
@0009@0014
I have been instructed
to lead this world.@0003
I will bring peace.
Why do you bar my path?@0003
@000C...You're wrong.@0003
Peace at the cost of humanity is
hardly any kind of peace at all.@0003
The man who ordered you is gone.
You can stop!@0003
You have no reason to fight!@0003
@0009@0012@0016......@0003
@000C@0016
None of us have reason
to fight.@0003
@0009@0014...I feel that eons ago...@0003
I heard those same words.@0003
Soft words, like a warm breeze...@0003@0002
@0009@0016......@0003@0016@0002
But that was long ago...@0003
I have slumbered for far
too long.@0003
In the darkness, I dreamed...
An empty dream. Black. Colorless...@0003
But I am awoken now.
His Majesty willed it so.@0003
@000C@0014His Majesty...
Zephiel!@0003
@0009@0014
I am awoken. I have left
the darkness of my dreams.@0003
My path is now lit.
I know what I must do.@0003
@000C@0012@0016......@0003@0005
@0009@0011@0009@0010@014A@0014@0016I will lead this world...@0003
No matter how much time must
pass, that is my duty...@0003
@000C@0013You insist on fighting us?@0003
@0009@0014
As long as you
stand in my way.@0003
@000C@0013Your will...seems unbreakable...@0003
@0009@0014My will is His Majesty's.@0003
I awoke for the purpose of
fulfilling his desires.@0003
[0202]
@0010@0103@0012This is the end! We've come
too far to lose now!@0003@0011
[0203]
@0010@0104@0012@0017...Do we have to fight...?@0005
...Sniff...@0003@0011
[0204]
@0010@0105@0012@0017...We've finally made it.@0003@0011
[0205]
@0010@0106@0012@0017Is this the end?
Or is it the beginning...?@0003@0011
[0206]
@0010@0107@0012@0017This is the demon dragon...?@0003@0011
[0207]
@0010@0108@0012@0017We cannot afford mistakes.@0003@0011
[0208]
@0010@0109@0012@0017I will fight honorably as
a knight of Ostia!@0003@0011
[0209]
@0010@01BD@0012@0017You can do this...
Just trust in yourself.@0003@0011
[020A]
@0010@010A@0012@0017This won't be easy.@0003@0011
[020B]
@0010@010B@0012@0017No matter what happens,
I will protect Lord Roy...@0003@0011
[020C]
@0010@010C@0012@0017Can we win...?@0005
Of course we can!@0003@0011
[020D]
@0010@010D@0012@0017The long battle comes to
an end.@0003@0011
[020E]
@0010@010E@0012Fascinating...
Now, shall we?@0003@0011
[020F]
@0010@010F@0012@0017Saint Elimine...
Give us strength!@0003@0011
[0210]
@0010@0110@0012@0017Finally, an end to the battle
of dragon and man...@0003@0011
[0211]
@0010@0111@0012@0017I have friends I can trust.
There's no way I can lose now!!@0003@0011
[0212]
@0010@0112@0012@0017Let's see just how
powerful this dragon is.@0003@0011
[0213]
@0010@0113@0012@0017I will win.
I will win!@0003@0011
[0214]
@0010@0114@0012@0017...It begins.@0003@0011
[0215]
@0010@0115@0012Whoa... There's something
you don't see everyday!@0003@0011
[0216]
@0010@0117@0012A truly powerful enemy!
Haven't met one in years!@0003@0011
[0217]
@0010@0118@0012I will protect Lord Roy with
my life!@0003@0011
[0218]
@0010@0119@0012@0017Lord Roy, Lord Eliwood...
Thank you for everything!@0003@0011
[0219]
@0010@011A@0012@0017If we take our time...
we can win.@0003@0011
[021A]
@0010@011B@0012@0017At last...peace shall
come again...@0003@0011
[021B]
@0010@011C@0012@0017Please be careful,
Lord Roy.@0003@0011
[021C]
@0010@011D@0012@0017This looks dangerous...
Not that that's anything new.@0003@0011
[021D]
@0010@011E@0012This is it! The great battle
I've been waiting for!@0003@0011
[021E]
@0010@011F@0012@0017We must be wary...@0003@0011
[021F]
@0010@0120@0012@0017Whooooooooooa!
I'm burning up!@0003@0011
[0220]
@0010@0121@0012@0017...I won't lose.
I will protect us all!@0003@0011
[0221]
@0010@0122@0012@0017Father...
Watch over us.@0003@0011
[0222]
@0010@0123@0012@0017Whoa!
We gotta fight that thing?!@0003@0011
[0223]
@0010@0124@0012This is it! The power I've
been searching for!!@0003@0011
[0224]
@0010@0125@0012@0017This is the demon dragon...!
Such power...! Yes...!@0003@0011
[0225]
@0010@0126@0012@0017It's...huge...@0003
@0011
[0226]
@0010@0127@0012@0017The time has come...@0003@0011
[0227]
@0010@0128@0012@0017I...will not lose!@0003@0011
[0228]
@0010@0129@0012@0017All right!
Chaaaaarge!@0003@0011
[0229]
@0010@012A@0012@0017I'll focus all my strength
into this one strike!@0003@0011
[022A]
@0010@012B@0012@0017Let there be peace in
your dying heart...@0003@0011
[022B]
@0010@012C@0012Let's go already.@0003@0011
[022C]
@0010@012D@0012@0017I can sense...
a sad heart...@0003@0011
[022D]
@0010@012E@0012@0017For everyone back in Bern...
and for Galle...@0003@0011
[022E]
@0010@012F@0012@0017I not afraid!
This time, I not afraid!!@0003@0011
[022F]
@0010@0130@0012Yeah, we'll be fine.@0003@0011
[0230]
@0010@0131@0012@0017Sigh....
Give me a break...@0003@0011
[0231]
@0010@0132@0012@0017Finally, Ilia will
know peace again...@0003@0011
[0232]
@0010@0133@0012@0017This is the end...
Finally, the end...@0003@0011
[0233]
@0010@0134@0012@0017Concentrate, Roy.@0003@0011
[0234]
@0010@0135@0012@0017I hope this'll
be the last battle.@0003@0011
[0235]
@0010@0116@0012@0017I know I've become strong...
Now's the time to show it!!@0003@0011
[0236]
@000C@0010@0102@0017Now is the time of truth!@0003
I have the blade of Hartmut, who took
pity on you and spared your life!@0003
Everyone, leave the final blow to me!!@0003
[0237]
@000C@0010@0102@0017I don't want to fight you...
But I can't leave things as they are!@0003
The history of man may be tainted...
but we can do great things as well!@0003
I will fight and prove that to you!@0003
[0238]
@0010@014A@0017I...@0004I...@0004
Gah...@0005I...@0003
I am alone...@0005
in the dark...@0003
I am alone...@0005in...@0005
darkness...@0003
[0239]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0102@0009@0012@0017Ah!@0003
@000C@0013Oh no...
The sanctuary is collapsing!@0003
Everyone! Hurry outside!@0003
@0009Roy...@0003
@000CI'll be fine.@0003
Now go!!@0003
[023A]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009Lord Roy!
You are unharmed!@0003
@000C@0017
Yes...but the sanctuary
is gone.@0003
@0009
It was over a thousand years old.@0003
A great deal of energy was
released in the battle we fought.@0003
The foundations probably couldn't
withstand the pressure.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009
Today marks the beginning
of a new era.@0003@0002
...Who is that you are
carrying on your back?@0003
@001C@000D@0010@014B@001C@000C@0017
Oh, yes.@0003
Merlinus, I need to ask
a favor of you...@0003
[023B]
And thus this conflict, called 
[023C]
"The Great Movement of Bern," ended. 
[023D]
Bern finally surrendered. 
[023E]
Etruria took watch over Bern for a while, 
[023F]
but never directly interfered 
[0240]
in their state affairs. 
[0241]
With the help of Roy, 
[0242]
who played the biggest role in the war, 
[0243]
Bern was rebuilt, 
[0244]
with Guinivere as its queen. 
[0245]
And on the day of her crowning... 
[0246]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0102
@0009
Today is Princess Guinivere's
crowning ceremony.@0003
@000C
I haven't seen her in her
royal garments yet,@0003
but I'm sure she is beautiful
beyond description.@0003
Even at our first meeting,@0003
I had no words to describe
her sheer beauty.@0003
@0009Truly.@0003
@000C@0017
But she has many
struggles still to come.@0003
@0009What do you mean?@0003
@000C
After she is crowned queen of Bern,
even with Etruria's support,@0003
I'm certain there will be great
unrest and plots to overthrow her.@0003
@0009Do you think so?@0003
@000C
Some may claim that she only joined
Etruria to seize the throne.@0003
It's an unfortunate reality, but to the
ignorant, that is how it will appear.@0003
@0009
...But I'm sure she will be fine.@0003
Under her rule, Bern will prosper
like never before...@0003
@0017She's too brilliant and strong
to succumb to petty unrest...@0003
@000CYes...
I agree.@0003
@0009@0017
...What about you?
What will you do now?@0003
@000C@0017Me?
I will return to Pherae.@0003
I'm concerned about my
father's illness,@0003
and there is much
reconstruction to be done.@0003
@0009@0017
Um...I...
What if we...@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009@0017Uh... Never mind.@0003
@0017But you're returning to Pherae...
That's good.@0003
@000C@0017What about you?@0003
Will you go back to Ostia?@0003
@0009...Yes. I must take my
father's place.@0003
@000C
I'm glad you're staying
in Ostia.@0003
@0009@0017...Why do you say that?@0003
@000C@0017
Because if you're in Ostia, then
we can see one another any time.@0003
@0009@0017What...?@0003
@000C@0017Lilina...@0003
I don't know when,
but some day...@0003
I'll come for you.@0003
@0009@0017
...I...I have to
prepare, too...@0003@0002
But...Roy...
I've always...@0003
@000COh!@0003@0017
The ceremony's starting.
Come, Lilina!@0003
Let's see Princess...
No, Queen Guinivere!@0003
This is the start of her
reign as queen!@0003@0011
@0009@0017
What I'm trying to say is...
I've always... Wait, what?!@0003
R-Roy, wait for me!@0003@0011
[0247]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102@000C
Princess Guinivere, you have my
congratulations on your ascension.@0003
@0009I thank you...@0003
But my battle is
just beginning.@0003
@000C@0017I'm sorry...@0003
I wish we didn't have to
rely on Etruria.@0003
@0009@0017
Not at all. I am grateful for
their support.@0003@0017
There will be those, however,@0003
who think I only joined
Etruria to seize the throne.@0003
@000CPrincess...@0003
@0009But the most important task at
hand is Bern's reconstruction.@0003
I must regain the people's trust
through my efforts.@0003
No matter how long it takes...@0003
@000C
If there is anything I can do to
help, please don't hesitate to ask.@0003
@0009@0017Thank you again.
Perhaps I will someday.@0003
Roy, are you...@0003
@000C@0017Yes?@0003
@0009@0017
What will you do?@0003
Will you stay in
the Etrurian Army?@0003
@000C
No, I must return to Pherae.@0003
I am concerned about my
father's illness,@0003
and we must begin the
reconstruction effort.@0003
@0009
You are returning home?
I am sure that's for the best.@0003
Still...@0003
Someone of your ability could easily
take a place in the Etrurian court.@0003
@000C@0017M-me?!@0003
I don't think I deserve
such a position!@0003
@0009@0017Pherae is blessed to have
such a gifted heir as you.@0003
[0248]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0152@0017Your Highness...@0003
@0009@0017Please call me Guinivere.
What is the matter?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, Lady Guinivere.
The ceremony is about to begin!@0003
@0009@0017Thank you.
I will be there shortly...@0003
[0249]
@0008@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102
@0008@0017Roy, will you
come with me?@0003
@000CMe?@0003
@0008
You have helped me so much ever since I
left Bern with the Fire Emblem in hand.@0003
I want you to see the path Bern will
take under my leadership.@0003
@000COf course.@0003
If you will have me, then it is
my pleasure to accompany you.@0003
@0008@0017Then come...
This way.@0003
@000CLet us see a new Bern...@0005
And the beginning of a new era.@0003
[024A]
Later, in Arcadia...
[024B]
@0009@0010@016E@000C@0010@0102
@0009Ah, Lord Roy.
It has been far too long.@0003
@000C
Yes, it is good
to see you.@0003
@0009Fae will be glad
to see you as well.@0003
@000C
I saw her earlier.@0003
She is even more energetic
than I remember.@0003
@0009
We have allowed her outside
more since her return.@0003
Perhaps that is why.@0003
@000C@0017How is Idunn doing?@0003
@0009We succeeded in restoring
her soul, and yet...@0003
@000C
...She's not back
to normal?@0003
@0009
Fae sometimes takes her outside,@0003
but she will do nothing without
first being told to.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
@0009Lord Roy...@0003
We had known for long that
she had been captured.@0003
I feared the consequences of
leaving the village, however,@0003
so I forbade any effort to
rescue her.@0003
Now, though, I wonder whether
my judgment was correct...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009
Perhaps the humans are changing
the way I think.@0003
I will do my best to restore
Idunn's heart and soul.@0003
@000C...You have my
gratitude.@0003
@0009
An expression of emotion would
be a promising first step...@0003
A laugh, for example...@0003@0009
[024C]
@000C@0010@014A@0009@0010@0104
And that is called
a tree!@0007@0005
@000C@0017Tree...@0007@0005
@0009@0080@000B@0017Right!@0005@0006
And this tree has
tasty fruit!@0007@0006
@000C@0017Fruit?@0007@0005
@0009@0017Yeah. @0006Can you see it?@0006
It's up at the top.@0007@0006
And if you @0006shake the tree@0006
like this...@0005@0080@000B@0080@0004
@0080@000B@0080@0004
@0009@0017Oww!@0080@000B@0080@0004
@0006@0005
@0009@0017It fell on
my head...@0007@0006
@000C@0017Heh...@0006
@0009Idunn...?@0006
Did you just laugh?@0007@0005
@000C@0017Laugh...?@0006
This is a laugh?@0006@0006
@0009@0017Where's Roy?@0006@0006
@0080@000B@0080@000BI have to tell Roy
that you laughed!@0006@0006
[024D]

[024E]

[024F]

[0250]
@000C@0010@014AA warm...breeze...@0005@0006@0006
[0251]
@000C@0010@0102@0017Oh no...
The sanctuary is collapsing!@0003
Everyone! Hurry outside!@0003
[0252]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009Lord Roy!
You are unharmed!@0003
@000C@0017Yes...but the
sanctuary is gone.@0003
@0009It was over a thousand years old.@0003
A great deal of energy was
released in the battle we fought.@0003
The foundations probably couldn't
withstand the pressure.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009
Well, Lord Roy, our
struggle is over.@0003
@000C@0017
No. It hasn't even started yet.@0003
We must help rebuild the land
from the damage caused by the war.@0003
There is much to be done.@0003
The real work is only just
beginning!@0003
[0253]
And thus this conflict, called 
[0254]
"The Great Movement of Bern," ended. 
[0255]
Bern finally surrendered.

take a place in the Etrurian court.@0003
@000C@0017M-me?!@0003
I don't think I deserve
such a position!@0003
@0009@0017Pherae is blessed to have
such a gifted heir as you.@0003

come with me?@0003
@000CMe?@0003
@0008
You have helped me so much ever since I
left Bern with the Fire Emblem in hand.@0003
I want you to see the path Bern will
take under my leadership.@0003
@000COf course.@0003

[0262]
Peace returned to the world, 
[0263]
and the people slowly began to recover. 
[0264]
As stability returned, 
[0265]
Elibe faced a new age of prosperity. 
[0266]
And thus, 
[0267]
the story of the many people 
[0268]
who mourned, wept, and laughed 
[0269]
during this great conflict 
[026A]
came to a close...
[026B]
@0010@0102@0017I'm sorry...
I let you all down...@0003

Smell of the grass...@0003

Lord Roy...please...take care...@0003
[0286]
@0010@011D@0017Finally, the fun part

[0287]
@0010@011E@0017Oh, man... I really messed

@0010@012C@0017Heh heh...

[0296]
@0010@012D@0017My...future...holds no...

[0297]
@0010@012E@0017Princess Guinivere...@0003
Please...follow your heart...

@0010@012F@0017I...hurt...

[029B]
@0010@0132@0017
So... It ends like
this, then...@0003
[029C]
@0010@0133@0017People of the Isles...
Never stop fighting!@0003
[029D]
@0010@0134@0017Etruria... Be a beacon...
for the future...@0003
[029E]
@0010@0135@0017Why...now?
I'm sorry...@0003
[029F]
@0010@0116@0017I...can't die yet...@0003
[02A0]
@0010@0154@0017Oh no!@0003@0002
I'm getting out of here before
I lose all my goods!@0003
[02A1]
@0010@0122@0017I-I...
I'm sorry...@0003
[02A2]
@0010@011C@0017Lord Roy...
Forgive me...!@0003
[02A3]
@0010@0154@0017Lord Roy!
Forgive me...!@0003
[02A4]
@0010@0157@0017Roy...!
Live on...@0003
[02A5]
@0010@0142@0017You...!
You're that girl!@0003@0011
@0010@0103@0017Excuse me?
Have we met before?@0003@0011
@0010@0142@0017What?!
You have forgotten me?!@0003
That...is inconceivable!@0003
[02A6]
@0010@0142@0017You're Melady...
Hah!@0003
@0017You betray your home
and join the enemy.@0003
You are a disgrace!@0003@0011
@0010@012E@0017My loyalty has always
lied with the princess.@0003
And so it shall
remain!@0003@0011
[02A7]
@0010@0142@0017You...@0003@0011
@0010@012AGeneral Narcian...@0003
I heard everything
from Sir Galle!@0003
Do you...have no sense of
honor left in you at all?!@0003@0011
@0010@0142Galle...! He has always
been a thorn in my side!@0003
@0017But no matter...@0003
After I wipe you up here,
no one will know the truth...@0003
[02A8]
@0010@0142@0017Cecilia...
@0017Back for more, are you?@0003@0011
@0010@0134@0017It was Zephiel to whom I lost.
Not you.@0003@0011
@0010@0142Fair enough, but now you will
know my true strength!@0003
[02A9]
@0010@0142If it isn't General Perceval,
the back-stabbing traitor!@0003@0011
@0010@011A@0017
Joining you...was the greatest
mistake of my life.@0003
I will make up for it...
by defeating you!@0003
[02AA]
@0010@0147@0017You were one of Narcian's
troops.@0003
I heard the story from Galle.@0003
You have my sympathy,
but you are my enemy now.@0003
Come!
We fight!@0003
[02AB]
@0010@0147@0017Melady...
I don't want to fight you.@0003
But you are here.
It seems we have no choice.@0003
Come!@0003
[02AC]
@0010@0147At last, the great
General Roy stands before me!@0003
I have been waiting to
match blades with you!@0003
[02AD]
@0010@0148@0017You are a knight of Bern.@0003
You have chosen to follow
Princess Guinivere.@0003
You have chosen your path
as I have chosen mine.@0003
@0017If you believe in it,
then fight for it!@0003
[02AE]
@0010@0148@0017You are a knight of Bern.@0003
You have chosen to follow
Princess Guinivere.@0003
You have chosen your path
as I have chosen mine.@0003
@0017If you believe in it,
then fight for it!@0003
[02AF]
@0010@0142Well, if it isn't
General Perceval, the traitor!@0003@0011
@0010@011A@0017
Joining you...was the biggest
mistake of my life.@0003
And now I shall repent
for it...by defeating you!@0003
[02B0]
@0010@01CD...A survivor of
the Kutolah?@0003@0011
@0010@0105@0017Monke! Feel the wrath
of the Kutolah!@0003@0011
[02B1]
@0010@01CD@0017You are the granddaughter
of the Silver Wolf...@0003@0011
@0010@0106@0016......@0003
[02B2]
@0010@0145Thea?
What are you doing here?@0003
@0017Oh...
You've joined Etruria.@0003@0011
@0010@0128Captain Sigune...@0003@0011
@0010@0145You know the code of the
Ilian knights.@0003
You will get no mercy
from me.@0003
[02B3]
@0010@0145You...@0003
You're Juno's youngest sister.@0003@0011
@0010@0129@0016......@0003@0016@0011
@0010@0145
My honor as a knight of
Ilia is at stake.@0003
Don't expect me to
hold back.@0003@0011
@0010@0129@0017I know...@0003@0011
[02B4]
@0010@0144@0017Lady Lilina?@0003
I see the assassination
failed...@0003@0011
@0010@0122Legance...
Why?@0003@0011
@0010@0144Times are changing,
milady.@0003
I won't be left in
the dust.@0003
I'm not like Lord Hector.@0003
He was too foolish to
accept the obvious.@0003@0011
@0010@0122Hush yourself!@0003
I will not let you
insult my father!@0003
[02B5]
@0010@0108@0017Legance, you miscreant!@0003
Have you no shame for your
betrayal of Lord Hector?!@0003@0011
@0010@0144Barthe...
Shut your ugly mouth.@0003
@0017Lord Hector was a fool.
His death was his own doing.@0003
I do not intend to fall
along with him.@0003
@0011
@0010@0108@0017You'll eat those words!@0003
[02B6]
@0010@0144Bors! I see
you yet live.@0003@0011
@0010@0109@0017I do.@0003
And I see you took over
Ostia in my absence...@0003@0011
@0010@0144@0017Do you have any
grievances with that?@0003
Take it back yourself...
if you can!@0003
[02B7]
@0010@01BD@0017Legance!
You shall fall here!@0003@0011
@0010@0144@0017Ah, Bors' sister, correct?@0003
You have the courage, but can
you truly stand against me?@0003
[02B8]
@0010@013C@0017Bors! You returned!@0003@0011
@0010@0109Causing a rebellion after
Lord Hector's death?!@0003
That is inexcusable!@0003
[02B9]
@0010@0146@0017Klein!
You would betray me?@0003@0011
@0010@010DYou are the one who betrayed
Etruria, Lord Arcardo!@0003
[02BA]
@0010@0146@0017D-Douglas!@0003
You had turned to the enemy...!?@0003

[02BB]
@0010@013D@0017Douglas... Hmph!@0003
After all that you said, you've
gone back on your honor!@0003@0011
@0010@010A@0017
Indeed it may appear that way.
But I fight true.@0003
I fight with my heart and I
have confidence in our cause.@0003@0011
@0010@013D@0017Silence!@0003
Enough of your nonsensical
rambling. Die here!@0003
[02BC]
@0010@010F@0017Aren't you...a priest?
The things you've done...@0003
@0011
@0010@0140@0017What of them?@0003
Anything can go unpunished...if
done in the name of the gods!@0003
@0011
@0010@010F@0017...There is no
salvation for you.@0003@0011
[02BD]
@0010@010E@0017With all the evil you've done,@0003
I dare say you've lost the right
to call yourself a bishop.@0003@0003@0011
@0010@0140@0017Evil? I am simply living
as I like.@0003
All deeds are righteous if
done in the name of the gods.@0003
Very convenient,
don't you think?@0003@0011
@0010@010E@0017You're a disgrace to the church...
Punishment awaits you!@0003@0011
[02BE]
@0010@0136@0017I fought honorably...
I accept my death...@0003@0002

No? Too bad. You could
take it if you made room.@0003
[02EE]
That's a shame. You could
carry it if you made room.@0003
[02EF]
Ah, well... You could take

Merlinus is full, too!

@000A@0010@0134Do you want to quit your training?
@0018
[030B]
@000AFeel free to come back if you
ever need more training.@0003
[030C]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0122
@0009@0017Lilina, are you all right?
Do you need anything?@0003
@000CNo, I'm fine.@0003
@0009Are you hurt?@0003
@000CNo, all is well.@0003
@0009
Very well, then. If there's
anything I can do for you--@0003
@000CRoy, it's all right.@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000C@0017
Thanks for worrying about me,
but I'm fine.@0003
@0009Well, if you say so...@0003
But if you ever need anything,
tell me.@0003
@000CI will.@0003
[030D]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0122
@0009@0017Lilina.@0003
Lilina!@0003
@000CHm? Roy?@0003
@0009What's the matter?
You were spacing out again.@0003
This is a battlefield.
You could get killed!@0003
@000CI'm sorry.@0003
@0009What's wrong?@0003
@000C
It's just that...
we've come so far.@0003
@0009Have we?@0003
@000C
I'm not talking about distance...@0003
It's just that everything seems
to have changed so quickly.@0003
Do you remember back when you
first came to Ostia to study?@0003
@0009Of course.
It was two years ago...@0003
Wait, or was it three
years ago?@0003
@000C
Our fathers were still both well.
Lycia was peaceful...@0003
No one could have imagined
this war.@0003
...It was only a few years ago,
yet it feels like an eternity.@0003
@0009Lilina...@0003
@000C
Oh, just listen to me...@0003
There's no going back to
those days, is there...?@0003
[030E]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0122@0017
Roy...I'm sorry
about before.@0003
@0009Before?@0003
@000C
I was reminiscing about before
the war.@0003
It's all changed... I need to accept
that nothing will ever be the same...@0003
@0009
No, some things will
never change.@0003
@000CLike what?@0003
@0009
Like us. We'll always
be together.@0003
@000CHuh...?@0003
@0009
We can't go back to the past, but we're
the ones who will build the future.@0003
We'll make the future as good as--no,
better than the past.@0003
@000CHa ha ha...@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000C
It's you. Talking like that.
Are you trying to charm me?@0003
@0009
W-was it that obvious?@0003
Yeah, I guess it was a
little overly grand...@0003
@000CBut really...@0003
@0009Hm?@0003
@000CThanks...@0003
@0009Lilina...@0003
@000C
And you're right...
We'll be together forever.@0003
@0009...Of course.@0003
[030F]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@011C
@0009What's the matter, Marcus?@0003
@000C@0017They're not good.
Not good at all.@0003
@0009@0017What's not good?@0003
@000C@0017The young recruits. Their combat
skills leave much to be desired.@0003
Granted, not all of them are
disappointments, but most are soft!@0003
What they need is a more intense
training regimen...@0003
@0009@0017
I don't know if I'd call anyone
soft... Everyone's working hard.@0003
@000C@0017
My Lord Roy, you are far
too easy on them.@0003
I shall go and teach them
how we used to do things!@0003
@0009@0017
Just don't work yourself
too hard.@0003
You're not as...well, youthful
as you used to be.@0003
@000C@0017Nonsense!@0003
I may be getting on in years, but I'm
still more than a match for the youth!@0003
@0009@0017
If you think more training is
what they need, then go ahead.@0003
Just take care not to overwork
yourself. Age can be cruel.@0003
@000COf course, my lord.
Thank you for your concern.@0003@0009@0011
@000C
Lord Roy is such a caring and
thoughtful young master...@0003
The other youths we have can't
even compare... It's a disgrace!@0003
I'm the only one who can serve
our Lord Roy properly.@0003
[0310]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@011C
@000C@0017
Lord Roy, I believe training needs
to be made more difficult.@0003
@0009More difficult?@0003
@000CYes, my lord.@0003
And those who fail to perform
up to par should be discharged.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016
Such rules may make our numbers small,
but we will be an army of elites.@0003
That would increase our combat
efficiency several times over.@0003
@0009No, Marcus.
I don't think so.@0003
@000CWhat...?
Why not?@0003
@0009
Who's to judge whether someone
is performing up to par?@0003
@000C
Why, you, naturally,
Lord Roy.@0003
@0009
But some soldiers may excel
while I'm not looking.@0003
@000C@0017Ah, yes...
Well, in that case...@0003
@0009@0017
We also have people supporting
us off the battlefield,@0003
and yet more who simply haven't
yet had a chance to shine.@0003
I couldn't discharge such
soldiers.@0003
Many have joined us thanks to
their belief in our fight.@0003
I can't simply tell them
to leave.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016
Marcus, try to trust them.
We're all working together.@0003
@000C...You are right.@0003
I was mistaken, Lord Roy.
Your ideas are noble.@0003
@0009
It's strange to hear
you praise me.@0003
I'm more used to hearing
you scold me.@0003
@000COh?
Are you?@0003
@0009Yes. But thank
you, Marcus.@0003@0011
@000C
Lord Roy... He has grown
into a fine young man...@0003
I'm certain he can make it
on his own.@0003
My work is nearly
complete...@0003
[0311]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@011C
@0009@0017
Marcus, is something wrong?
You seem unwell.@0003
@000CI apologize, my lord.@0003
I have been considering
retirement...@0003
Age has worn me down...@0003
@0009Retirement?@0003
@000CThe young soldiers have grown strong.
Perhaps now is the time.@0003
@0009@0017...Marcus.
You can't be serious.@0003
@000C@0017I have grown old...@0003
A feeble old man like me
has no place at your side.@0003
It is time I made way for
the next generation.@0003
@0009No...@0003
@000CYes, I will retire soon.@0003
@0009No!
I still need you!@0003
@000CLord Roy...@0003
@0009
I'm sorry about what I
said to you before.@0003
But you don't need to
retire yet.@0003
@000C
But I'm far too old...
I have no place on the battlefield.@0003
@0009
I still have much to learn
from you.@0003
If you leave...to whom
can I turn for advice?@0003
@000CLord Roy... I had no idea
you trusted me so much...@0003
@0009
Don't retire yet...
I need your help.@0003
@000CAs you will, my lord.@0003
I shall serve you
until the day I die.@0003
[0312]
@0009@0010@010B@000C@0010@0102
@000CWolt!@0003
@0009Lord Roy,@0005
is something wrong?@0003
@000C@0017
...Just call me Roy.
I've known you all my life.@0003
@0009@0017
I appreciate your kindness,
but rules are rules.@0003
@000C@0017
Do you really think so?@0003
You suddenly feel so
distant to me.@0003
@0009@0017
What are you saying?
I'm right here in front of you.@0003
@000C@0017That's not what I meant.@0003
@0009@0017Ha ha, I know.@0003
But enough talk.@0003
We haven't time to
laze about here.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009Let's go!@0003
The battle awaits us,
Lord Roy.@0003
[0313]
@0009@0010@010B@000C@0010@0102@000C@0017Wolt!
About before...@0003
@0009
Lord Roy, the issue
was settled.@0003
More importantly, this
is a battlefield.@0003
You never know where
enemies are hiding.@0003
Keep on your guard.@0003
@000CWolt...@0003
You're starting to sound
like Merlinus and Marcus.@0003
@0009Am I?@0003
Thank you!
That is such praise.@0003
All I desire is to be as
loyal a servant as they are.@0003
@000C...Are you serious?@0003
@0009Of course!@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009Lord Roy?
Is something wrong?@0003
@000CNo.@0003
Leave me alone for
a while, would you?@0003
@0009Lord Roy...?@0003
[0314]
@0009@0010@010B@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017Lord Roy!@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009
You do not look well. Is there
something on your mind?@0003
@000C...Actually, there is.@0003
Would you mind if we
talked about it?@0003
@0009@0017Of course not!
I'll do my best to help.@0003
@000C@0017
You see, I'm a bit frustrated
with someone in the army.@0003
I understand where he's coming
from, but...@0003
@0009
You understand his logic, but your
feelings don't agree. Is that it?@0003
@000CYes, exactly.@0003
My feelings don't align with what
I know to be true.@0003
And when I start feeling frustrated,
I feel like telling him.@0003
@0009Then do so!@0003
It is bad for your health to
keep your feelings bottled up.@0003
Besides, we all know you are
in a stressful position.@0003
I'm sure he will understand if
you feel the need to vent.@0003
@000CDo you think so?@0003
@0009Of course!@0003
If you want, I can go talk to
that person.@0003
I will always support you, so don't
hesitate to ask anything of me.@0003
@000C@0017
Thanks, Wolt.
I feel better now.@0003
But enough chatter!
We have to get moving!@0003
@0009Yes, Lord Roy!@0003
@0017...By the way, tell me who it
is you're frustrated with.@0003
I will sit him down and have
a frank discussion...@0003
@000C@0017No, it's all right now.@0003
@0009@0017Really?
...Who was it?@0003
@000C@0017He's closer than you realize.@0003
@0009@0017What? Where?@0003
@0016......@0003@0016
...Was it...me?@0003
@000C@0017You got it!@0003
@0009@0017Lord Roy!@0003
[0315]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017
How should I
move next, Roy?@0003
@000COh, yes.@0003
You should...
...Um...@0003
@0009What's the matter?@0003
@000C
Nothing. It's just that...@0003
It feels so strange giving
you orders...@0003
@0009Why?@0003
You lead this army.@0003
Who else would give
me orders?@0003
@000CEven so...@0003
@0009@0017
Roy, you mustn't go soft.@0003
If a leader gets soft,
then so will the troops.@0003
You are a general leading an
army, and I am your soldier.@0003
Be strict and assertive,
as a general should be.@0003
@000CY-yes, you're right!@0003
@0009@0017Good.@0003
Now, General Roy,
what is my next move?@0003
[0316]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@0102@000C@0017Yawn...@0003
@0009@0017Roy.@0003
@000C@0017Oh, General Cecilia.@0003
@0009@0017
Are you tired?
Perhaps you should rest.@0003
@000C@0017
I can't. We must
keep moving.@0003
@0009@0017
Rushing forward will only
lead us to failure.@0003
@000C@0017I'm not rushing, but we must move
as quickly as possible.@0003
@0009Why?@0003
@000C
The quicker we move, the
more lives will be saved.@0003
@0009...Yes, that's true.@0003
@000C
We fight to win this war.@0003
But how can we call it a victory with
the deaths of so many innocents?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016
Oh, I'm sorry... I didn't
mean to talk back to you.@0003
Are you cross with me?@0003
@0009@0017
Not at all. I was too focused
on a simple victory.@0003
You are already becoming a
worthy leader.@0003
@000C@0017Please, enough flattery...@0003
@0017But...hearing it from
you is encouraging.@0003
@0009Really?
That's nice to hear.@0003
[0317]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@0102@000C@0017
What are you going to do
once this war is over?@0003
@0009@0017Sorry?@0003
@0017Do you think
you've won already?@0003
@000C@0017No...
Not at all.@0003
@0009@0017Well...@0003
We must rebuild Etruria,
so first I will go home.@0003
Why do you ask?@0003
@000C@0017I was wondering if you could teach
me more after the war.@0003
@0009Like I did in Ostia?@0003
@000CExactly!@0003
@0009
There's no need for that now.
You've become a true leader.@0003
There is nothing left for me
to teach you.@0003
@000C@0017But...@0003
@0009@0017
Roy, you must have confidence.@0003
Troops will not follow a leader
who lacks confidence.@0003
@000C@0017...Yes, you're right.@0003
@0009@0017That is my last lesson
for you.@0003
You are no longer a student.@0003
You are a colleague and
a friend.@0003
So if there's anything I can
assist you with after the war,@0003
it would be my pleasure to
help you.@0003
@000CReally?@0003
@0009Of course.@0003
I will always be on your side.
Never forget that.@0003
[0318]
@0009@0010@012D@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Lord Roy...@0003
@000C@0017Sophia?
What's the matter?@0003
@0009@0017
Please...don't strain
yourself today...@0003
@000C@0017What do you mean?@0003
@0009@0017
I sense something ominous...
in this battle...@0003
Please stay off the
front lines...@0003
@000C...I understand.@0003
But I'm not sure I'll be able to
pay full heed to your warning.@0003
@0009...Why not?@0003
@000C
When I go up front...it's
because I trust the others.@0003
I can't hide myself in the
back in fear.@0003
I have to fight alongside
everyone else.@0003
@0009Oh...I...@0003
@000C@0017
I appreciate the warning,
but...I'm sorry.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
[0319]
@0009@0010@012D@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Lord Roy...@0003
@000C@0017
Sophia? Do you
sense something?@0003
@0009@0017
No... I just wanted
to apologize...@0003
@000CApologize?
To me?@0003
@0009About before...@0003
I told you I sensed something
ominous about the battle...@0003
@000COh, that...@0003
@0009I'm sorry...@0003
You already have much
on your mind...@0003
I shouldn't have
burdened you so...@0003
@000C@0017
No, it's all right.@0003
I'm actually glad that
you told me.@0003
I was more cautious
that day. Thank you.@0003
@0009@0017@0016...?@0003@0016
@000C@0017If you hadn't told me anything,
I wouldn't have been so cautious.@0003
I may have been hurt badly.
So thanks.@0003
@0009@0017But...I...@0003
@000C@0017
Tell me if you sense anything.
It's a great help.@0003
@0009Yes... I will...@0003
[031A]
@0009@0010@012D@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Lord Roy...
I must tell you something...@0003
@000C@0017What's the matter?@0003
@0009@0017My power...is weak...@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009
I can see the future...
but only blurry images...@0003
I may not see...something
truly powerful...@0003
@000CSomething truly powerful?@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
If I fail to sense something
powerful...and if you are hurt...@0003
@000C@0017
Thanks, but I'll be fine.@0003
We'll figure it out when
the time comes.@0003
@0009@0017But...@0003
@000C@0017Sensing the future is an
amazing ability.@0003
We can prevent disasters
before they even occur.@0003
But I won't rely on your power
too much, so don't worry.@0003
@0009@0017Thank you...@0003
@000C@0017
I'm more concerned about your
well-being than your predictions.@0003
I'm sure we'll face many hardships
as we continue...@0003
But keep your spirits up and there's
nothing we can't overcome.@0003
Let's go!@0003
@0009You're right...
Thank you...Lord Roy...@0003
[031B]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017
Whew, I've finally finished
outlining the troops' positions...@0003
@0009Lord Roy.@0003
@000CHuh?!@0003
Oh, Sue. Hello.@0003
@0009
What's the matter? You have
a strange look on your face.@0003
@000C@0017I was just surprised
that you spoke to me.@0003
@0009@0017Oh?@0003
@000C@0017Yes...@0003
I never see you speaking
with other people.@0003
You don't like talking
much, do you?@0003
@0009@0017That's not the reason.@0003
@000C@0017It isn't?@0003
@0009@0017
I simply prefer communing
with nature over people.@0003
@000CNature?@0003
@0009The breeze, the trees,
the sky, the brooks...@0003
They all speak to us.@0003
@000CThey do?@0003
@0009They do.
Listen and you'll hear them.@0003
You can't hear them simply
because you don't listen.@0003
I bid you farewell for now.@0003
@000C
Wait, you didn't have
anything to tell me?@0003
@0009I did.
I just told you.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009
Listen to nature, and you'll
hear all sorts of voices.@0003
It will bring you peace of
mind and soul.@0003
You won't be able to hear them
if you're tense all the time.@0003
@000CSue...@0009@0011@0003
@000CWas she trying to help me
because I look so tired...?@0003
Thank you, Sue.@0003
[031C]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0102@000CSue.@0003
@0009@0017Lord Roy?@0003
@000C@0017Thanks for your advice.@0003
@0009...You look better.@0003
@000CDo I?@0003
@0009
Your aura...
has improved.@0003
@000CWhat do you mean?@0003
@0009It is softer.
More comfortable.@0003
@000CDo you think so?
I can't really tell.@0003
@0009Hm hm hm...@0003
Perhaps such things cannot be
sensed by those who work the land.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009What is it?@0003
@000CThat's the first time
I've heard you laugh.@0003
@0009@0017Really?@0003
@000C@0017Yes.@0003
Your laugh has a good
aura to it, too.@0003
@0009...Thank you.@0003
[031D]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0102
@000CWhat are you going to do
when this war is over?@0003
@0009I'll return to Sacae.@0003
@000CBut wasn't the Kutolah clan
destroyed by Bern...?@0003
@0009
We will gather everyone once more.@0003
Perhaps the Kutolah name is no more,
but our clansmen survive.@0003
@000C
That's... Well, I guess that's
the right thing to do.@0003
@0009Why do you ask?@0003
@000C
I thought if you had no place to
go that you could come to Pherae.@0003
@0009Pherae...
Your home.@0003
@000CRight...@0003
It's not a huge area, but it's
a nice and peaceful place.@0003
@0009It would be nice...@0003
But my heart belongs in
the plains of Sacae.@0003
@000CI understand.@0003
But tell me if you ever
change your mind.@0003
@0009Lord Roy.@0003
@000CYes?@0003
@0009Thank you for your concern.@0003
@000CYou're very welcome.@0003
[031E]
@0009@0010@0129@000C@0010@0102@0009What's the matter, Lord Roy?
Do you need something?@0003
@000CNo, I just noticed that
you seem so...carefree.@0003
@0009@0017
Hey! Are you making
fun of me?@0003
@000C@0017Not at all.
I'm envious, actually.@0003
@0009@0017...I still think I'm being
made fun of.@0003
@000C@0017
Trust me, I'm not making fun of you.@0003
You see, as the leader, I must always
appear confident and optimistic.@0003
I worry and despair like everyone
else, though.@0003
So I wanted to ask you.@0003
How can I be as carefree as you?
Can you offer me any tips?@0003
@0009Tips?@0003
@000C
You know, things I can do or a mindset
I should have, or anything really.@0003
@0009Hmm...@0003
Eat well, sleep well,
and laugh well.@0003
@000C@0017...Is that all?@0003
@0009@0017Probably.@0003
That's all it takes to
enjoy life, isn't it?@0003
@000C@0017...Maybe so.@0003
@0009@0017I'm sure you feel you have to
think deeply in your position...@0003
But it's probably not as
complicated as you think.@0003
[031F]
@0009@0010@0129@000C@0010@0102@000C
You said you're a pegasus
knight-in-training, right?@0003
@0009Right.@0003
@000C
Why are you fighting
outside of Ilia?@0003
@0009That's the rule.@0003
Fighting outside of Ilia gets us
experience we won't get in the country.@0003
@000CWhat kind of experience?@0003
@0009We can see foreign fighting styles,
foreign cultures...@0003
And of course, there's the money.@0003
@000C@0017I see...@0003
Then shouldn't you fight in other
armies and see what they're like?@0003
@0009@0017
Huh? No, there's no need for that!@0003
There's no other army that travels
all over like this one.@0003
I couldn't ask to be in a better
army than this for my training.@0003
@000C@0017Well, all right.
If you say so.@0003
@0009@0017
...Were you worried
about me?@0003
@000CI guess so.@0003
@0009Hee hee hee!
Thanks!@0003
[0320]
@0009@0010@0129@000C@0010@0102
@000C
Shanna, what will you do
when the war is over?@0003
@0009Me?@0003
Lemme think... First off,
I'll probably go back to Ilia.@0003
@000C@0017Oh...
I see.@0003
@0009@0017Why?@0003
@000C
I was just wondering if you
wanted to come to Pherae.@0003
@0009Your home?
I'd love to!@0003
I want to see it
at least once.@0003
@000C
Well, it's not as big as Ostia
so you might be disappointed.@0003
@0009
I'm sure my hometown is way
smaller than yours.@0003
Plus it snows a lot.@0003
@000CGreat. Then you
should like it.@0003
@0009I'll look forward to it.@0003
@000CSure.@0003
You're welcome to stay
as long as you like.@0003
@0009Thanks!@0003
@000C@0011
@0009Lord Roy is so kind...@0003
Inviting a simple mercenary
like me to his home...@0003
Wait...
Does that mean...?@0003
No, no, don't get any crazy
ideas... But still... Hmm...@0003
[0321]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0102@001C@0009@0080@000DLord Roy!@0003@001C
@000C@0017@0080@000FWha--?!@0003
@000DL-Larum...!@0003
@000B@0017
I finally found you! I want
to show you something.@0003
@001C@000D@0017
W-wait!
Just take it easy...@0003@001C
@000B@0080@000B
@000DWhat...was it you wanted
to show me?@0003
@001C@0009@0080@000DIt's like this!@0003@001C
@000DH-hold on a moment.
I can hear you from over here...@0003@001C@000B@0080@000B@000D@0080@000E@001C
@0009
I want you to see the
new dance I came up with.@0003
It goes like this...@0003@0002
Step and twirl,
step and twirl...@0003@0002
So? What do you think?@0003
@000C@0017
It was very nice. I think you're
an exceptionally skilled dancer.@0003
@0009...Is that it?@0003
@000CHuh?@0003
@0009@0017
You don't...have more to say?@0003
Like, "Beautiful!" or, "Lovely!"
or, "Your hair looks nice today!"@0003
Or something like that...@0003
@000CErm...
I had better get going...@0003
@0009Already?@0003
@000CYeah, sorry...@0003@0011
@0009Sigh...@0003
[0322]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0102
@001C@0009@0080@000DLord Roy!@0003@001C
@000C@0080@000F@0017L-Larum...!@0003
I don't think you should grab
on to people like that...@0003
It might cause a
misunderstanding.@0003
@001C
@000B
But Lord Roy...@0003
@0016......@0003@0016@0002
Oh!!@0003@001C
@000DWhat?@0003@001C
@000B@0017Eeek!
An enemy!@0003@001C
@000D@0017Enemy?!
Where?!@0003@001C
@000B@0017
I don't know! But I heard a
rustling in the bushes...@0003@001C
@000D@0017
L-Larum! Calm down...@0003
I can't move if you're
hanging off me like that...@0003@001C
@000B@0017
I'm going to die!@0003
But...that's OK.@0003
If I can die protecting you,
Lord Roy, I will die in peace.@0003
You, hiding in the bushes!
Show yourself!@0003
Our love is eternal
and can never be broken!@0003@001C
@000D@0017P-please, get off of me
so I can fight...@0003
[0323]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0102
@0009Lord Roy!@0003
@000C@0017Larum...@0003
@0009@0017
There you are! I have
another dance to show you.@0003
@000C@0017Y-yeah...@0003
@0009Lord Roy...?@0003
Are you...
avoiding me?@0003
@000CAh...@0003
N-no!
Not at all.@0003
@0009You are so.@0003
I saw you step back
when I came.@0003
You're bracing yourself
so you can dodge me.@0003
@000CY-you're imagining things.@0003
@0009
Don't look away when
you talk to me...@0003
@000CB-but...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
You don't like me...@0003
You don't want to see
my dancing at all!@0003
That's it, isn't it?!@0003
@000CTh-that's not true!!@0003
@001C@0009@0080@000D@0017
Really?! Thanks!
That makes me so happy!@0003@001C
@000C@0080@000F@0017Whoa!@0003
[0324]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0118
@0009@0017Hmmm....@0003
@000C
Is something wrong,
Lord Roy?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Lord Roy!@0003
@0009Oh! Alen.@0003
Sorry, I was lost
in my thoughts.@0003
@000C
You seem to be thinking a lot
these days, Lord Roy.@0003
@0009Maybe so...@0003
@000C
What are you
worried about?@0003
@0009
I was just thinking about
how to move our troops.@0003
@000CHow to move the troops?@0003
@0009
The enemy grows stronger all the time
so strategies quickly become obsolete.@0003
I was wondering how to effectively
break through their defensive lines.@0003
@000C
That's easy, Lord Roy!
Just allow me to charge in.@0003
I will shatter their shields
and pierce their armor!@0003
@0009
Thanks for the offer, but I don't
want to put you in danger.@0003
There must be another way...
I'll think on it some more.@0003
[0325]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0118
@000C@0017
Lord Roy, I have an idea of how to
break through the enemy's defenses...@0003
@0009An idea?@0003
@000C
We leave our best troops behind, and send
the weaker ones to the front lines.@0003
Once the enemies are weakened, the stronger
troops will be able to finish them.@0003
Please, allow me to be in the front lines
with the other weaker soldiers!@0003
@0009
But then we would risk losing you
and everyone you're with...@0003
@000C
We might suffer some casualties,
but we will win the battle!@0003
@0009
...Alen, I can't
use that idea.@0003
@000CW-why not, milord?@0003
@0009
I can't use a strategy that I
know will cause casualties.@0003
@000C
But Lord Roy, casualties
are unavoidable in war...@0003
@0009...I think not.@0003
It may be naive to say so, but a victory
with casualties is no victory at all.@0003
@000C
You want a complete victory...
Is that possible in war?@0003
@0009
I think it is.
We need another plan.@0003
[0326]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0118
@0009@0017Hmm...@0003
@000CStill thinking,
Lord Roy?@0003
@0009
Yes, I haven't thought of
a good strategy yet...@0003
But yours is out of the
question, understand?@0003
@000CYes, Lord Roy.@0003
But if there's anything I can do,
please don't hesitate to ask.@0003
@0009I won't.@0003
@000C...Lord Roy.@0003
@0009Yes?@0003
@000C
...To be honest, I'm not sure I agree
that a complete victory is possible.@0003
But if that's what you believe, then I
will support you any way I can.@0003
@0017@0009
Thank you, Alen.@0003
I will prove to you that we
can win without casualties.@0003
@000CI look forward to the day
of our glorious victory!@0003
[0327]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@0102@0009@0012@0017
Lord Roy!
Are you unharmed?@0003
@000C@0017Lance?
What's the matter?@0003
@0009@0017
I lost sight of you for a moment
so I assumed the worst...@0003
@000C@0017
Oh. Is that all?
Don't worry so much.@0003
@0009@0017
No, Lord Roy.
You lead this army.@0003
You must always be
on your guard.@0003
@000CYes, you're right.
I'll be more careful.@0003
@0009Truly?@0003
@000CI promise you.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
[0328]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017
Lord Roy, if I may
offer a suggestion.@0003
@000CWhat is it?@0003
@0009
I think you should stay
behind the front lines.@0003
@000CWell...@0003
@0009
I know what you're thinking,
but please understand.@0003
As our leader, you are
crucial to the army.@0003
If an army's leader is lost,
then so is the battle.@0003
@000CThat's true...@0003
@0009Then please, milord, allow me
to escort you this way...@0003
@000C
Wait.@0003
I have no right to order others if
I prioritize my safety above all else.@0003
@0009That's not true!@0003
@000C
I'm not exactly a genius, and I'm
not especially charismatic, either.@0003
I have to gain everyone's trust by
experiencing the same hardships.@0003
@0009Lord Roy...@0003
@000C
I don't have that special something
that makes someone a leader.@0003
That's why I need to fight up
front along with everyone else.@0003
[0329]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@0102@000C@0017
Lance, I've been thinking
about what you said,@0003
but I still think that I
should stay up front.@0003
I know you only think of
keeping me safe, but...@0003
@0009
No, I may have been too
forceful with my opinion.@0003
Do what you believe to
be correct.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Thank you.@0003
It puts my mind at ease
to hear you say that.@0003
@0009@0017
I still believe you were wrong
about one thing, however.@0003
@000C@0012You do?@0003
@0009@0013
You said that you're not a genius
and that you lack charisma.@0003
@000C@0012Yes, I did say that.@0003
@0009@0013
Your intelligence and charisma are
exactly why people follow you.@0003
None would give their life for
someone who lacks those traits.@0003
@000C...Do you think so?@0003
@0009@0014
Of course.@0003
If you will allow me one
piece of advice,@0003
no matter what happens,
stay true to your heart.@0003
As long as you do that,
your troops will follow you.@0003
@000C@0013@0017I'll do my best.
Thank you, Lance.@0003
@0009@0013
It's my pleasure,
milord.@0003
[032A]
@0009@0010@010D@000C@0010@0103@000CEeek!
Klein!@0003
@0009@0017
W-what's wrong, Clarine?!@0003
@000C@0017
You look absolutely
stunning in that outfit!@0003
@0009@0017
...That's all?@0003
And here I was wondering what
kind of danger you were in...@0003
@000C@0017
My dear brother Klein!@0003
Everyone is so aesthetically
handicapped in this army!@0003
You are a lone diamond
shining in the rough!@0003
@0009@0017
You only think so
because we're family...@0003
@000C@0017I do not!@0003
There are none in this world
who can match your beauty.@0003
Knight General Perceval may
have more authority,@0003
but you clearly have superior
sense in beauty!@0003
@0009@0017
...Clarine, a lady shouldn't
verbalize such things.@0003
@000CI only say what
is true.@0003
@0009...Clarine.@0003
@000C@0017But if that's what you think,
Brother, I will try.@0003
@0009@0017Good.@0003
[032B]
@0009@0010@010D@000C@0010@0103
@0009@0017Clarine, come here.@0003
@000C@0017Oh, Klein?
How do you fare today?@0003
@0009@0017Not well, I'm afraid.@0003
@000C
Is something wrong?@0003
@0009
Is it true that you spoke harshly to
a cleric and made her cry yesterday?@0003
@000C@0017
Absolutely not. I did not make her cry.
She is the one who chose to cry.@0003
@0009@0017...But she cried because
of what you said to her.@0003
@000CIt was her fault! She was trying
to keep you for herself.@0003
@0009What do you mean?@0003
@000C...She healed your wounds
before I got the chance.@0003
@0009Clarine!@0003
@000CI wanted to heal your injuries so
you would be proud of me!@0003
All I want is to be of some help
to you, Brother...@0003
@0009...I was proud of you.@0003
I was so glad that my naive little
sister had grown up so much...@0003
But now that you've done this, I
don't know what to think anymore...@0003
@000CI-I'll never do it again!@0003
Please don't hate me, Klein!@0003
@0009Don't be ridiculous.
I could never hate you.@0003
@000C@0017Oh, thank you, Klein!@0003
[032C]
@0009@0010@010D@000C@0010@0103@0009@0017What's wrong, Clarine?
You look sad.@0003
@000C
I...I don't want to go back
to the manse after the war...@0003
@0009Why not?@0003
Mother and Father anxiously
await our return.@0003
@000C
I do want to see Mother and Father...@0003
But if I return to the manse, I will
be nothing but a doll once more.@0003
Never again to see the outside world,
concerned only with decorating myself...@0003
@0009Well, that is how most
Etrurian ladies are.@0003
@000CYes, I know...@0003
But being the most elegant in Etruria
does not seem as appealing as it once did.@0003
@0009
That's because you're growing and
maturing, Clarine.@0003
If you stay at the manse, you could
live your life without any worries.@0003
@000C
But it would be so
horribly boring!@0003
@0009@0017Yes, indeed...
All right, here's what we will do.@0003
Once this war is over, we will first
let Mother and Father know we are safe.@0003
@000COf course.@0003
@0009From there we can discuss your
future and what you want to do.@0003
@000C
Oh, I already know what
I want to do!@0003
@0009@0017Do you?@0003
@000C@0017
I will become Mage General
like General Cecilia!@0003
@0009@0017Err...
Are you serious?@0003
@000C@0017Of course!@0003
As Mage General, I will give you, the
new Archer General, my full support.@0003
Then we shall be together always!@0003
@0009@0017Clarine...
Let's be realistic...@0003
@000C@0017
Oh, how wonderful it would be for us both
to wear that elegant general uniform...@0003
@0009@0017Clarine...@0003
You haven't grown at all.@0003
@000C@0017Did you say something?@0003
@0009@0017No. Never mind.@0003
[032D]
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0103@000COh! We certainly
do meet a lot.@0003
@0009@0017...You again?@0003
@000CYou will address me
as Lady Clarine.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016@0017
I want to tell
you something.@0003
@0009@0016@0017Yes?@0003
@000C@0016@0017It is about your appearance.@0003
@0009@0016@0017What?@0003
@000C@0016@0017
You actually do have quite
an attractive face.@0003
Of course, it is no comparison
to my beloved brother Klein's,@0003
but for a commoner, you aren't
entirely hideous.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016
I can use my Etrurian aesthetic sense to
make you into a truly handsome noble...@0003
@0009@0011
@000C@0017Oh! Wait!
Where did he go?@0003
I was not finished speaking
to him!@0003
I should have known he was
nothing but a tramp!@0003
[032E]
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0103@000C@0017There you are!
I won't let you go this time!@0003
@0009...Leave me be.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
That is no way to respond
to a lady's kindness!@0003
@0009
You're getting
on my nerves.@0003
@000C
That is no way to talk
to a lady...@0003
That...is not how a proper
gentleman...should act...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C......@0003
@0009@0016...All right, I'm sorry.
Stop crying.@0003
@000CI-I'm not...!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0011
@000C@0016...I know he is not to blame...
So why am I acting this way...?@0003
[032F]
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0103@0009@0017...Hey.@0003
@000COh...@0003
@0009You dropped this.@0003
@000CWhat?
Oh, my ribbon...@0003
@0017Thank you for
returning it to me.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Um...@0003
I just realized...
I don't know your name...@0003
Might I trouble you to
tell it to me?@0003
@0009@0017...Rutger.@0003
@000CRutger...@0003
I never even thanked you
for saving me...@0003
It is no wonder you don't
like me...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000C@0017I thank you for rescuing me in
my time of need...@0003
I know it is far overdue, but I
hope you will accept my thanks...@0003
@0009@0017...That's not like you.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009Don't try to be someone
you're not.@0003
You're good at screaming,
so stick with that.@0003
@000CWh-what do you
mean by that?!@0003
@0009@0017
That's it... That's you.@0003
Give me your company once in a
while, Clarine. Make me smile.@0003
@000C@0017@0016!!@0003@0016
@0009@0011
@000CRutger...@0003
[0330]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@0103
@000C
Excuse me, would you
mind sitting still?@0003
I'm trying to heal
your wounds for you...@0003
@0009@0017
What's a kid like you doing
on the battlefield?@0003
@000C@0016!!@0003@0016
@0009
Are you lost?
Where are your parents?@0003
@000C@0016!!!@0003@0016
Watch your tongue!@0003
Have you any idea who--@0003
@0009@0017
Yeah, you're high rank
nobility, right?@0003
That's no reason for
you to be here, though.@0003
@000C@0017@0016!!!@0003@0016
Filthy peasant...!
Listen and be dumbstruck!@0003
I am Lady Clarine of
House Reglay of Etruria!@0003
@0009
What? Then you're
Lord Pent's daughter...@0003
@000C@0017You know my father?@0003
@0009@0017And Klein's little sister...@0003
@000C
You know Klein, too?!@0003
Who...are you...?@0003
@0009Never mind.
Forget it.@0003
@000CI shall NOT forget it!@0003
@0009Clarine, was it?
Be careful out there.@0003@0011
@000CWhat?!
Wait!@0003
...Who is
he...?@0003
[0331]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@0103
@000C@0017...I told you to speak! Who are you?@0003
Keeping quiet is of no benefit, but
talking will put you in my good graces!@0003
@0009Do you ever shut your mouth?
Seriously, let me be, kid...@0003
@000C
You will address me
as Lady Clarine!@0003
@0009@0017
Whatever.
Listen, "Lady" Clarine.@0003
Try doing something other
than tailing me everywhere.@0003
You might actually be useful
for once in your life.@0003
@000C@0017
Foul man...!@0003
@0009@0017I'm foul, all right.
Probably best just to avoid me.@0003
@000C@0017
...You are manipulating me. I will
not be driven away so easily.@0003
@0009
Yikes, there's nothing attractive
about you at all.@0003
You say you're Lady Louise's
daughter? I don't believe it.@0003
@000C@0017That's it! My family!
I want to ask you about my brother!@0003
@0009@0017
Dang, you saw right past the insult!
You're catching on, kid...@0003
@000CYou will address me
as Lady Clarine!@0003
@0009@0011
@000CWait!
Wait, I say!@0003
[0332]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@0103
@0009@0017
...All right, you win.
I'll tell you.@0003
Just stop following
me everywhere I go...@0003
@000C@0017
Finally, you see reason. Please go
ahead. Start at the beginning.@0003
@0009@0017
It's not really a long story
or anything...@0003
I just used to work for your
family as an arena combatant.@0003
@000CAre...are you Dieck,
by chance?@0003
@0009Uh, yeah.
You didn't even know my name?@0003
@000C@0017
Truly?! I always wanted
to meet the noble Dieck!@0003
@0009@0017
What are you talking about?@0003
@000C@0017You saved my brother's life!@0003
@0009@0017Who told you?@0003
@000C@0017Everyone! My father, my mother,
my brother himself...@0003
I grew up hearing about the
great man named Dieck.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016
I was still in the cradle
when you left...@0003
I always regretted not
being able to meet you.@0003
But finally, here you are!@0003
@0009@0017
OK, yeah... So now
you've seen me.@0003
Satisfied?@0003
@000C@0017I am.@0003
@0009Good.@0003
Then you'll stop hovering
over me wherever I go.@0003
@000COh, no, I'll follow you to
the ends of the continent!@0003
@0009@0017Anything
but that...@0003
@000C@0017You saved my brother's life.
I owe you a debt of gratitude.@0003
I want to hear all about my brother.@0003
Oh, you could regale me with tales
for hours...@0003
@0009@0017...Maybe I could,
but I won't.@0003@0011
@000C@0017
Oh! Wait, Dieck!@0003
Come back!
I'll never let you go!@0003
[0333]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@0103@000C
Oh?
And you are...?@0003
@0009@0017
Ah, you must be Lady Clarine
of House Reglay.@0003
I am Lance, knight of Pherae.@0003
We are honored to have someone
of your stature among us.@0003
I apologize for any impudence you
may have experienced from the men.@0003
The soldiers are simply a bit
anxious because of this war.@0003
@000C@0017Oh...
Yes, consider them forgiven.@0003
@000CI don't often grant favors
like this so easily.@0003
Consider it an honor!@0003
@0009@0017Yes, I thank you, milady.
Now, let me take your hand...@0003
@000C@0017My... So civil and
gentlemanly!@0003
For a country knight,
that is.@0003
@0009@0017I am honored.@0003
@000C@0017O-of course, your manners are nothing
compared to our knights back home.@0003
@0009@0017Please forgive my
breeding, milady.@0003
[0334]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@0103
@000CLance.@0003
@0009@0017Lady Clarine. Is there anything
I can do for you?@0003
@000C@0017As the daughter of House Reglay,@0003
I order you to serve as my
bodyguard henceforth.@0003
@0009@0017But--@0003
@000C@0017In truth, you are a bit on the
feeble side...@0003
But I don't have many knights to
choose from, so you will do.@0003
You must stay by my side and
defend me at all times.@0003
Understood?@0003
@0009@0017If Lord Roy orders it,
it will be done.@0003
@000CBut...
I'm ordering it! Me!@0003
@0009
If I may object, milady, I cannot
follow your orders directly.@0003
A knight must serve his lord,
and only his lord.@0003
One who fails in that is no
longer a knight.@0003
@000C
I...I knew that!@0003
I was merely testing your
knightly integrity!@0003
@0009Yes, milady.
Forgive me.@0003
@000CY-yes, well,
you passed my test.@0003
Stand proud, knight!@0003
[0335]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@0103
@000C@0017Lance!@0003
@0009Yes, Lady Clarine?@0003
@000C
Even if you are not mine to order...
Are we not a lady and knight?@0003
@0009Indeed we are, milady.@0003
@000CIn-indeed...@0003
As such, I hereby permit
you to kiss my hand.@0003
@0009Thank you, milady.@0003
@000C
Lance, I don't want you to
misunderstand.@0003
The kissing of my hand is a symbol
of the difference in our status.@0003
There is no more meaning to it
than that!@0003
@0009Yes, of course, milady.@0003
@000CYes...
Of course...@0003
You're not...
disappointed...?@0003
@0009Did you say
something, milady?@0003
@000CN-no!
Nothing!@0003
Back to your duties,
knight!@0003
[0336]
@0009@0010@0103@000C@0010@010C@0009@0017Oh?
You...@0003
@000CYes? Me?@0003
@0009Why do you dress yourself
in men's clothing?@0003
@000CIs that strange...?@0003
@0009Of course! A lady must wear
elegant dresses.@0003
And a lady must be dressed
properly even when she fights.@0003
@000CReally...?
I suppose you're right.@0003
I know nothing about that
kind of stuff...@0003
@0009Hm... So I see.@0003
@0017Well, I suppose I can teach
you all that I know.@0003
@000C@0017What? N-no!@0003
Being ladylike
doesn't suit me...@0003
@0009@0017
Don't be absurd!
All ladies must be ladylike.@0003
No gentleman will even give you
the time of day if you look like that.@0003
@000CD-do you think so...?@0003
Well...if you're serious...
then all right!@0003
Please teach me,
Lady Clarine!@0003
[0337]
@0009@0010@0103@000C@0010@010C@0009
So... Dorothy, what is
your schedule like?@0003
@000CI'm pretty busy even off
the battlefield.@0003
I help cook meals and
stuff...@0003
@0009@0017What?!@0003
Leave such dirty jobs to that
plebeian Merlinus fellow!@0003
@000CP-plebeian?
Sir Merlinus is plebeian?@0003
@0009@0017
How do you take care
of your hair?@0003
@000CI wash it with water.@0003
@0009@0017What?!
I don't believe this...!@0003
Here, use this shampoo.@0003@0017
Wash your hair with it
three times a day!@0003
@000C@0017Th-three times?@0003
But...it looks so expensive...@0003
I appreciate it, but I think
it would be wasted on me.@0003
@0009None of that now!
I am offering it to you.@0003
Please, take it.@0003
@000C
Oh... Well, thank you,
I guess.@0003
@0009Additionally...you must change
your speech patterns.@0003
@0017Try to speak more like me,
with a refined, elegant tone.@0003
@000C@0017Um... OK...@0003@0002
@0017My, such a beautifious day!@0003
Let us partake of the tea
and of the crumpets.@0003@0002
@0017Like that?@0003
@0009
...This will take much work...@0003
First things first. You must learn
how to take care of your hair,@0003
and how to choose your dresses,
and how to dance properly,@0003
and how to turn down offers
from men...@0003
@000CThat much?!@0003
@0009That is just to start.
You mustn't give up!@0003
The path to becoming a refined
lady is a difficult one indeed!@0003
@000CSo it seems...@0003
[0338]
@0009@0010@0103@000C@0010@010C
@000C@0017Um... Lady Clarine?@0003
@0009Yes?@0003
@000C
I've been trying really hard to
be a lady, but...@0003
Nothing seems to have changed.@0003
No one seems to even notice.
Maybe I should just give up...@0003
@0009My...@0003
@000C
I'm sorry! I know you were
just trying to help me...@0003
But it's not your fault!@0003
There wasn't much to work
with anyway...@0003
@0009Dorothy!@0003
That is exactly what's
wrong with you!@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009Listen to me.@0003
A fine lady must have
confidence in herself.@0003
No matter how you dress,
without faith in yourself,@0003
it is completely and
utterly without meaning.@0003
Do not devalue yourself so.
Do you understand?@0003
@000CY-yeah, I think.@0003
@0009@0017
Have confidence in yourself!@0003
With me as your teacher, you
will be the finest of ladies!@0003
@000C...Thank you,
Lady Clarine...@0003
@0009@0017...One additional matter...@0003@0017
We are friends now,
are we not?@0003
@000C@0017Eh?@0003
@0009@0017
Don't call me
"Lady" Clarine.@0003
Simply "Clarine"
will do.@0003
@000C
Oh, right. OK.
Thanks, Clarine!@0003
@0009...Ahem! Today we shall cover
how to properly drink tea!@0003
@000CAll right! Tell me
everything you know!@0003
[0339]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@012D
@0009@0017@0016......@0003
@000C...?@0003
@0009......@0003
@000C@0016Fae? What are you
looking at...?@0003
@0009You grew.@0003
@000CR-really...?@0003
@0009Yeah.@0003
Why do I stay the same?!@0003
You used to be as
little as I am!@0003
@000C
I am half dragon...so I grow
more slowly than humans...@0003
But you...grow even
slower than I...@0003
@0009Why do I stay small?
Why don't I grow up like you?@0003
@000C
You are a full-blooded dragon...@0003
A dragon's lifespan...is
near eternity...@0003
I am part human...so we grow
at different speeds...@0003
Do you understand...?@0003
@0009No...@0003
@000CYou'll understand...
when you grow up...@0003
@0009@0017When will I grow up?
Soon?@0003
@000C@0017Yes...@0003
@0009@0017Yay!@0003
[033A]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@012D
@0009@0017Hmmm...@0003
@000C@0016...?@0003@0016
@0009Hmmmmm...@0003
Sophia, when will
I grow up?@0003
@000CWell...@0003
@0009I'm not growing at all...
I want to be a grown up!@0003
@000C
Be happy...
You will live...for eons...@0003
Even when I grow old and
die...you will live on...@0003
@0009What?!@0003
No! No, no, no!
You won't die!@0003
Nooooo!!@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Waaaaah!@0003
@000CFae...I'm sorry...
Don't cry...@0003
I feel the same way...@0003
But...that is what it means...
to live for an eternity...@0003
[033B]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@012D
@0009Sophia?@0003
@000C@0017Yes...?@0003
@0009@0017Um...@0003
@000C@0017Go ahead...@0003
@0009@0017I'm scared of when you grow up.
Will you still play with me?@0003
I never want you to leave me!
I want to play tag and other games.@0003
@000C@0017Fae...@0003
Don't worry... I'll always...
be your friend...@0003
I'll always be with you...@0003
@0009@0017Really?! Yay!@0003
@000C@0017Yes...@0003
As long as I live...
I will never leave you...@0003

@000CFae.@0003
@0009Igrene!@0003
Look! Look!
A butterfly!!@0003
@000C@0017Fae, don't you have
something to do?@0003
Didn't Lord Roy give
you orders?@0003
@0009Roy's orders are no fun.@0003
@000CFae, do as you're told.@0003
@0009Aww...@0003
But I don't want to.@0003
@000CFae.@0003
@0009...Er...@0003
@000CSay you're sorry.@0003
@0009...I'm sorry.@0003
@000CLook, Fae.@0003
You promised Roy you would do
what he asked, didn't you?@0003
If you make a promise, you
have to keep it.@0003
OK?@0003
@0009OK...@0003
@000C@0017There's a good girl.@0003
Now, let's go.@0003
@0009OK.@0003
[033D]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@011B
@000CCome here, Fae.
I'll braid your hair for you.@0003
@0009Yay!@0003
@000CDo you like having
your hair done, Fae?@0003
@0009Yeah, I love it!@0003
...Igrene, am I gonna
be pretty?@0003
@000CYes, I believe so.
You have such lovely hair...@0003
You'll be very, very beautiful
when you grow up.@0003
@0009Like you?@0003
@000CHm hm... I suppose.@0003
@0009Yay!@0003
Hey, Igrene?@0003
@000C@0017Fae, hold still.@0003
@0009OK.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016What's wrong?@0003
Did you hurt yourself?@0003
@000C
Oh, I'm sorry...@0003
I was just remembering
my daughter.@0003
She was a lovely girl,
much like you.@0003
@0009What happened to her?@0003
@000CShe's gone...
She's far away now.@0003
[033E]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@011B
@0009Igrene!@0003
@000CYes, Fae?@0003
@0009You were talking about your
little girl before.@0003
@000CYes, I was.@0003
@0009I know her.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009She came to play with me.@0003
When I was sad, she snuck in
with Sophia to play with me.@0003
She told me all about the
outside world.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016She said her mom was
the Desert Guardian.@0003
@000C@0017I see...@0003
@0009
But she stopped coming to
play with me.@0003
I asked Sophia about her,
but she wouldn't tell.@0003
Is it my fault?
Was I a bad girl to her?@0003
Did I make her angry
and leave?@0003
@000C
No... Not at all. She was
never mad at you, Fae.@0003
She can't play with you
anymore, but...@0003
She'll always love you,
Fae.@0003
@0009Really?@0003
@000CYes... Of course.@0003
[033F]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0106
@0009La la laaa...
Oh! It's Sue!@0003
@000CYou look like you're having
lots of fun, Fae.@0003
@0009Yes, I'm having lots
and lots of fun!@0003
I can be outside!@0003
@000CIs that so much fun?@0003
@0009
Yeah, because I was never
allowed to play outside before.@0003
@000C@0017Never...?
You were always indoors?@0003
@0009@0017Uh-huh.@0003
@000C@0017I...see.@0003
@0009@0017La la la laaa...@0003@0011
@000C@0017Always inside...@0003
She never knew the love of the Sky
or the warmth of the Earth...@0003
[0340]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0106@0009Sue!@0003
@000CWhat's wrong, Fae?@0003
@0009Can I ride on your
horse sometime?@0003
@000CMy horse?@0003
Of course. You can ride
her now if you like...@0003
@0009
No, not now. Roy told me
not to bug the others!@0003
@000C@0017I see...@0003
@0009@0017There's a place I want
to go on that horse!@0003
@000C@0017Where is that?@0003
@0009@0017A place with lots of pretty flowers!@0003
Or a place where the sun's shining
and it's all nice and warm!@0003
@000C@0017...All right.
Let's go sometime.@0003
@0009@0017Yay!
Thank you, Sue!@0003
[0341]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0106
@0009Sue!@0003
@000CFae?@0003
@0009I want to go to lots
of other places, too!@0003
I want to learn more about
the outside world.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Sue...@0003
@000C@0017Yes...@0003
@0017Once this war is over, let's
visit many different places.@0003
@0009Really?!@0003
@000COf course.@0003
There are many places nurtured by the
Sky's love and the Earth's warmth.@0003
We should see as many as we can.@0003
@0009Hmmm...@0003
I don't understand
what you're saying.@0003
Your words are
too big.@0003
@000C
You'll understand once you
get a little older.@0003
I know you will.@0003
[0342]
@0009@0010@0104La la laaa la...@0003
Oh...@0003@0002
A flower!@0003@0011@0006
@000C@0010@0124@0017A dragon...
Archenemy of mankind...@0003
@0017But something's...
strange...@0003
The dragons described in the old
scrolls were nothing like that.@0003
They were much more...inhuman.@0003
@0009@0010@0104Hm?@0003
@000C@0016...!@0003
@0009@0016Who are you?@0003
@000CM-me?
...I am Niime.@0003
@0009Niime?@0003
@000CThat's right...@0003
Oh, I must be off.
I have things to do.@0003@0011
@0009Weird lady.@0003
[0343]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0124
@000CFae.@0003
@0009Grandma Niime!@0003
@000CGrandma, huh...?@0003
You know, you're actually several
hundred years older than I am.@0003
@0009Huh?@0003
@000CNever you mind.@0003
Fae, take a look at
this gemstone.@0003
@0009What is it?@0003
@000C@0017
Once upon a time, humans and...
demons lived in this land.@0003
The demons used their immense
power to hurt the humans.@0003
The weak humans could do nothing
but watch as the bodies piled up...@0003
And then one day...
eight bright rays of light came.@0003
They could be used to defeat
the demons.@0003
@0009@0017Were they pretty lights?@0003
@000COh my, yes.@0003
@0017...The humans used the lights to
fight against the demons.@0003
After a long and difficult battle...
the demons were finally defeated.@0003
But that wasn't the end...@0003
@0009Mmm...mmm...mmm...@0003
I'm sleepy now...@0003@0011
@000C@0017So...this is the enemy of
mankind, is it?@0003
She doesn't seem to have a care
in the world...@0003
...In fact, she's adorable...@0003
[0344]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0124@0009Grandma Niime!@0003
@000CAh, hello, Fae.@0003
@0009@0017What's wrong?@0003
@000CWell...@0003
Do you remember the story I told
you about men and demons?@0003
@0009Um...@0003
@0017Yeah!
The pretty lights!@0003
@000C@0017
To tell you the truth...
I always feared those demons.@0003
After studying dark magic and
the history of mankind...@0003
only then did I discover just how
terrifying the demons were.@0003
@0009@0017Uh-huh.@0003
@000C@0017
But after meeting you...my fear
seems to have vanished completely.@0003
@0009What? Why?@0003
@000C@0017Pay it no mind.@0003
My long stories
must bore you.@0003
Here, go play
with this.@0003
@0009Yay!@0003@0011@0007
@000C@0017What a fool I was...@0003
I thought of doing such horrible
things to that innocent girl...@0003
Thinking it would protect the
human race... Hah.@0003@0017
There's no point in peace obtained
through such hideous measures.@0003
[0345]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@012B@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Hm? ...Do you need
something?@0003
@0009Uh! Ummm...@0003
What's that thing?
It makes pretty noises.@0003
@000CThis is a harp.
Do you like how it sounds?@0003
@0009Yeah!
I like it a lot!@0003
Also...what's
your name?@0003
@000CI am Elffin,
my dear.@0003
@0009@0017Alf...?@0003
@000C@0017Elffin.@0003
@0009Elffin!@0003
@000CThat's right.@0003
@0009I like your hair, too, Elffin!@0003
It's pretty in the wind and it
shines like gold in the light!@0003
I like pretty things like that!@0003
@000CI am honored.
Thank you.@0003
@0009Can I come and see you again?@0003
@000COf course.
Any time.@0003
[0346]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@012B@0009Elffin!@0003
@000C
Ah, the little lady
from earlier.@0003
Hello.@0003
@0009...My name's not
Thelitlady!@0003
@000COh, pardon me.
May I call you Miss Fae?@0003
@0009
My name's not Misfae either!
It's Fae!@0003
@000CAs you wish, Fae.@0003
Fae... A unique name.
Is it your full name?@0003
@0009No, my real name is reeeeally long.@0003
And they say it's a sound humans
can't hear.@0003
Fae's the only part that you can.@0003
@000CInteresting.@0003
@0009
But maybe you could hear it, Elffin!@0003
You make so many pretty sounds,
maybe you could hear my real name!@0003
@000CWhy don't you try telling
it to me some time?@0003
@0009OK!@0003
[0347]
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@012B@0009Elffin?@0003
@000CYes? What is it, Fae?@0003
@0009I always wanted to
ask you something.@0003
@000CWhat is it?
I hope I can give you an answer.@0003
@0009@0017Ummmm...@0003
@0017Are you a boy or a girl?@0003
@000C...Which do you think?@0003
@0009
I thought you were a girl at first
'cause you're pretty and smell nice!@0003
But the other day Roy called
you "he".@0003
Are you a boy?@0003
@000CYes, I am.
...Are you disappointed?@0003
@0009Nope!@0003
...Sooo, you're a boy...
Hee hee...@0003
@000C@0017Hm?
What's the matter?@0003
@0009@0017
I'll be as pretty as you
when I grow up.@0003
So wait for then, OK?
Promise!@0003@0011
@000CFae! Wait!@0003@0006
@0017...I sincerely doubt I will still be
alive by the time she grows up...@0003
@0017But I suppose I should let it go
for now.@0003
[0348]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0105
@000C@0017Chieftain.@0003
@0009Sin...@0003
I'm sorry I assigned you
such a difficult task.@0003
You have my thanks for
locating my granddaughter.@0003
@000CIt was my pleasure, Chieftain.@0003
@0009
It must have been a difficult journey.
Where did you go after you left us?@0003
@000C
After we lost the battle, I crossed
many lands in search of Sue.@0003
I rode through Lycia and crossed
the ocean to the Western Isles.@0003
That is where I found her.@0003
It was several months after you
gave me the order.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
Much time has passed since
we lost that battle.@0003
@000CChieftain...@0003
@0009We lost many of our clansmen.
...Young ones, too.@0003
@000C@0017But you survived, Chieftain.@0003
No matter how divided the clan may
be you can unite us once more.@0003
[0349]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0105@000C@0017
The nations in the west, Lycia
and Etruria,@0003
were very different from Sacae.@0003
There were soldiers clad in heavy armor
that would allow no arrows to pass.@0003
@0009
So I would imagine.@0003
In the vast plains of Sacae, horses
are our livelihood.@0003
But in more populated areas,@0003
key points are defended by soldiers
such as the ones you speak of.@0003
It is not surprising that our
tactics fail on foreign ground.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Betrayal and trickery are
simple tactics to them.@0003
It is only us who think such
methods dishonorable.@0003
It is no surprise we lost
with such a mindset.@0003
@000C...But...I cannot accept
such...dirty tactics.@0003
@0009You must accept the fact that
people use them, though.@0003
We must be prepared for them
when they are used against us.@0003
[034A]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0105@0009@0017Sin.@0003
@000CYes?@0003
@0009
Our Father the Sky has brought us
blessings in spite of our hardships.@0003
I think you have been especially
blessed.@0003
@000CWhat do you mean?@0003
@0009The land isn't as it used to be.@0003
We of Sacae must have broader
perspectives.@0003
We must think outside of
the clans.@0003
@000CBut Chieftain...@0003
@0009
You seem to have learned much
in your travels.@0003
This old wolf is too old to
learn new ways of thinking.@0003
But you are young.@0003
You are responsible for leading
Sacae to a brighter future.@0003
Consider this an order from
your Chieftain, Sin.@0003
It is the youth that will
decide Sacae's fate.@0003
@000CYes, Chieftain...@0003
[034B]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0105@000C@0017
Sue, please step back.@0003
It's not wise to linger
around the front.@0003
@0009Sin, this is a battle.
I must be up front to fight.@0003
@000CI will do the fighting.
You must remain safe.@0003
@0009My archery skills are much
better than they once were.@0003
I'm sure I can be of help
to the army.@0003
@000CI have orders from the
Silver Wolf to keep you safe.@0003
I will not allow you to put
yourself in danger.@0003
@0009...Very well.
Then I will do as you say.@0003
@000CThank you.@0003
@0009You sound like Grandfather
when you argue with me.@0003
@000CThat is the highest praise
you could give me, Sue.@0003
I respect the Silver Wolf
more than any other man.@0003
[034C]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0105@000C@0017
Sue, you're still up
front, aren't you?@0003
@0009I understand your concern, but I can't
sit around doing nothing, either.@0003
I can't stand watching the others
fight while I hide in safety.@0003
@000CI know that feeling.@0003
But Sue, don't push
yourself too far.@0003
You are the clan's
last hope.@0003
@0009That is all the more reason
I should be up front and fight.@0003
@000C
That depends on the place and time.@0003
Not everyone will follow somebody just
because she fights on the front lines.@0003
Sue, we have a clear goal we must
work towards.@0003
We must gather our people and rebuild
the Kutolah.@0003
Please do not forget that.@0003
@0009You too.@0003
@000CMe?@0003
@0009
Don't push yourself too far
in an attempt to protect me.@0003
I am not the only one working
to reunite the clan.@0003
@000CYes, you're right.
I shall remember that.@0003
@0009
Thank you. Do you promise
not to overstretch yourself?@0003
@000CYes, I do.@0003
[034D]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0105@0009@0017Sin, are you all right?@0003
@000CWhat is the matter, Sue?
You look troubled...@0003
@0009I heard you were ambushed...@0003
@000CI'm not hurt.@0003
@0009...Sin, I want you to retreat
to the back lines.@0003
I will take over for you.@0003
@000C
What are you saying, Sue?
It should be you in back!@0003
@0009
No, this is an order.
Step back.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
@0009Retreat to the back lines, Sin!
Will you disobey my order?@0003
@000CIs something wrong?
You're not acting like yourself.@0003
@0009
...Everyone...everyone was
killed by Bern's forces...@0003
I failed to track down the
traitor and...@0003
they were all killed,
right before my eyes...@0003
I was helpless, Sin.@0003
I never want to feel that again.
I don't want to lose you!@0003
@000CSue...@0003
@0009You must not die before I do.
Understood?@0003
@000CI was ordered to protect you, Sue.
I will not die and leave you.@0003
@0009Swear it to me.@0003
@000CI swear to our Father the Sky
and our Mother the Earth.@0003
[034E]
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@0113@000C@0017Oh...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016You're...
Sin, right?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016You joined this army, too?
What a coincidence.@0003
@0009Yeah...
It is.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
Um... Oh yeah.@0003
Did you find the woman
you were looking for?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I-I'm sorry...
Maybe I shouldn't have asked...@0003
@0009No...
It's fine.@0003
I found her.@0003
@000COh, you did?
That's nice to hear.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
[034F]
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@0113@000CSin!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0017@0016Is something wrong?@0003
@0009...I never asked you.
Which clan are you from?@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009Are you from Bulgar?@0003
Or are you one of the Djute
that betrayed us?@0003
@000C...I don't know.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
Was that...
a joke?@0003
@000CN-no, it wasn't.@0003
I lived alone with my parents so I
don't know much about the clans...@0003
@0009...I see.@0003
@000CUm, you're from
the Kutolah, right?@0003
You said so before.@0003
@0009That's right.@0003
Our chieftain is the Silver Wolf,
the strongest warrior in Sacae.@0003
None can match his mastery of
the sword and bow.@0003
@000C@0017You admire him greatly.@0003
@0009@0017...Can you tell?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I can tell by your eyes.
You're usually foreboding...@0003
I-I mean, quiet...@0003
But you look proud talking
about him.@0003
[0350]
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@0113@0009@0017You're...strange.@0003
@000CI...I am?@0003
@0009Sacaen women rarely pick up weapons,
and when they do, they choose the bow.@0003
Rarely does one see a girl pick up
a sword.@0003
@000COh...@0003
@0009Also...@0003
Sacaen people worship the
Sky and the Earth.@0003
You don't pray, and you don't
even belong to a clan...@0003
I have never met a Sacaen
like you before.@0003
@000CI-I'm sorry...@0003
@0009I'm not accusing you.
I actually respect it.@0003
You've shown me...that
people can live freely.@0003
@000CI think you're
exaggerating...@0003
But it still feels
nice to hear that.@0003
@0009You have beautiful eyes.@0003
@000CWh-what?@0003
@0009That must be because you look
straight ahead to your dreams.@0003
To mastering the sword.@0003
I will pray for your dream
to be granted one day.@0003
@000C@0017Oh! Thank you!@0003
[0351]
@0009@0010@0105@0017@0016......@0003@0002
......@0003@0002
......@0003@0011@0006
@000C@0010@010C@0016...Sigh...@0003
Why am I hiding here?
I want to talk to him, but...@0003
He's a little...scary.@0003
I want to see if we can show each
other any tricks with the bow.@0003
But how can I approach him?
Well...maybe some other time...@0003
[0352]
@000C@0010@010CHello, Sin!
My name is Dorothy.@0003
@0017...A little too sudden?@0003
@0017Would you like to have an
archery duel?@0003
@0017...But I don't want to
compete with him.@0003
@0017What a nice bow!
Where did you buy it?@0003
@0017...No, that doesn't sound
right at all.@0003
Hmm... This is tough.@0003
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0016......@0003
@000C@0016@0017Oh, I know!@0003
I can bring him some food
that he likes...@0003
Wait, but I have no idea
what he likes...@0003
I like fruit,
but what about him?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0011
@000C@0016Hmm... Well...
I need to think some more...@0003
[0353]
@000C@0010@010C@0017Hmm...@0003
...But why am I worrying
so much over him?@0003
...I can't figure that
out, either.@0003
Anyway, I have to figure
out a way to talk to him.@0003
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Oh...@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CUm, uh...er...@0003
@0017H-hello!@0003
@0009@0017Yes, hello...@0003
@000CUh, wh...what...@0003
@0009@0016?@0003@0016
@000CW-what...what...kind...@0003
@0009What kind...?@0003
@000CWhat kind food of do like you?@0003
...Shoot...@0003
@0009Fruit.@0003
@000CHuh?@0003
@0009You're asking what kind of food
I like, right? I like fruit.@0003
@000CUh...@0003
...Did you hear me
talking to myself?@0003
@0009It was difficult not to
with such a loud voice.@0003
@000CEr...uh...@0003
@0009If you wish to talk to me,
don't hesitate.@0003
@000C@0017It's all right?!@0003
@0009Of course...
We fight together.@0003
@000CYes, you're right!@0003
[0354]
@000C@0010@012A@0017Whoa!@0003@0011@0010@012A
@0009@0010@0105@0016......@0003@0016
@000CWhat are you doing, shooting at me?!
I'm on your side!@0003
@0009...Oh, right.
You are.@0003
@000CWhat do you mean, "Oh, right"?!@0003
A wyvern rider like me is finished
if I'm hit with an arrow.@0003
Just watch it, all right?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009@0011@0006
@000C@0014He sees me as an enemy.@0003
I can't really blame him
after what Bern did to Sacae.@0003
But we're allies...
We can't be quarrelling...@0003
I guess I should try to get
to know him better.@0003
[0355]
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@012A@000CHey, Sin!
How are you doing?@0003
@0009@0017...Fine, as you can see.@0003
@000C
You're really great with your bow, huh?
You hit almost all of your targets.@0003
I wish I could hit like you, but I'm
kinda...@0006 Whoa!!@0003
@0009Look out!@0003@0080@000C
@0016!!@0003
@000C!@0003@0016
@000A...Hm.
I missed his throat.@0080@000B@0003
@000C
I thought I'd finished
him already...@0003
Sorry to make you clean
up after my mistake...@0003
@0009I moved on reflex.
It was no trouble.@0003
@000C@0017That doesn't matter.
You still saved my life.@0003
Say, why don't you teach me to
attack more accurately?@0003
@0009@0017No.@0003@0011
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0017...Oh well. He saved my life,
so there's that, I guess...@0003
[0356]
@0009@0010@0105@0005@000C@0010@012A@0017Sin!
Behind you!@0003
@0009@0016!@0003@0016
@000CAre you all right?@0003
I guess even you have some
trouble when surrounded.@0003
@0009You didn't have to do that.@0003
@000CI couldn't help it.
I acted without thinking.@0003
@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000CI'll be going now.@0003
Just make sure you don't start
shooting at me again!@0003
@0009I wouldn't make
that mistake.@0003
@000C@0017You sure did before!@0003
...Well, we're in battle, so I don't blame
you for making mistakes now and again.@0003
@0009@0017I'm not stupid enough to point
my bow at an ally.@0003
...I will never shoot you.@0003
@000C...Yeah, you're right!@0003
@0009I'll be right behind you.
Leave the enemies you miss to me.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I will!@0003
[0357]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0106@000C@0017Grandfather.@0003
@0009Sue?
What's wrong?@0003
@000CI must apologize.@0003
@0009For not getting all of our
clansmen to safety?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016There was a traitor among us.
There was nothing you could do.@0003
@000CPerhaps, but I am responsible. I am
the granddaughter of the Silver Wolf.@0003
It was my duty to lead our clansmen to
safety, no matter the circumstances.@0003
But I...@0003
@0009It was I who gave you those orders.
It was my responsibility.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
@0009Did you abandon your fellow
clansmen and flee on your own?@0003
@000CNever!@0003
When the enemy appeared, I rushed at them
to make time for our people to escape.@0003
But it was a decoy...@0003
The enemy's main forces were stationed
exactly where everyone fled...@0003
@0009Then you performed admirably.@0003
I'm sure you won't forget it so
easily, but you must accept it.@0003
@000CYes...
I'll try.@0003
[0358]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0106@0009@0017
Sue, are you feeling
better now?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I see it still torments you.@0003
I suppose you wouldn't get
over it that easily...@0003
@000CI...I just let
our people...@0003
@0009...Sue, let's go out for a
long ride after this battle.@0003
@000CA long ride?
In a time like this?@0003
@0009Yes, absolutely.@0003
You could run to your death
with an occupied mind.@0003
Do you understand?@0003
@000CYes.
But...@0003
@0009
You must listen more carefully to the
voices of the Sky and the Earth.@0003
We humans are mere ants when compared
to their grandeur.@0003
Haven't I always told you this?@0003
@000CBut I am listening
to them...!@0003
@0009No, you listen only
to your own voice.@0003
We ride after this
battle.@0003
Understood?@0003
@000C...I'll do as you say.@0003
@0009Good.@0003
[0359]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0106@0009
You look much
better, Sue.@0003
@000CYes, and I feel better.@0003
@0017I'll never forget how I failed
to rescue our clansmen,@0003
but I've decided not to dwell
on the past.@0003
@0017I'll look towards
the future.@0003
@0009It seems that you learned something
from our ride.@0003
@000CI was able to listen to
nature's voices again.@0003
@0009Good!@0003
@0017I couldn't stand seeing you
so distressed.@0003
@000CI never showed it.@0003
@0009Perhaps the others couldn't
see, but I could.@0003
I'm your grandfather. I've known you
since the moment you were born.@0003
@000CGrandfather...
I...@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000C@0017Thank you.@0003
@0009@0017I was only doing my duty...
as your grandfather.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I know.@0003
[035A]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@010B@000C@0017
All right, where's
the next enemy?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Hm?
@0017Do you need something, Sue?@0003
@0009@0017You use a bow, too.@0003
@000CYeah, I do.@0003
@0009Why don't you
ride a horse?@0003
@000C
I've always fought like this.
On my feet.@0003
@0009Isn't it hard to fight
on the ground?@0003
@000CNo, not really.@0003
I mean, I think it would be harder
trying to shoot from horseback.@0003
@0009I see...@0003@0011
@000CUh, Sue?@0003
@0017...What was that all about?@0003
[035B]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@010B
@0009@0017Wolt.@0003
@000C@0017Oh, hi, Sue.@0003
@0009@0017I think it's better to
fight on horseback.@0003
@000CWhat?
...You mean with a bow?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
With a horse, it's easier to approach
and retreat from your target.@0003
@000C
Well, to each their own...@0003
Wait, did you try getting off your
horse and shooting from the ground?@0003
@0009Yes. I wanted to try it.@0003
@000CYou could have hurt yourself!@0003
You can't try new ways of fighting
like that during a battle!@0003
@0009No, it wasn't in battle.@0003
I just shot at some
trees near the camp.@0003
@000COh...@0003
@0009@0017Thank you.@0003
@000CFor what?@0003
@0009Thank you for being so
concerned about me.@0003
@000C@0017Well...@0003
@0017We're allies,
right?@0003
[035C]
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@010B
@0009@0017Wolt?@0003
What's the matter?
You're out of breath.@0003
@000C@0017
...It sure is tough trying to keep
up with a horse...@0003
I mean, I remember you said it was
easier to approach your target.@0003
So...@0003
@0009@0017You tried it?@0003
@000C@0017I thought I may as well.@0003
@0009@0017What did you think?@0003
@000C@0017
Well, a horse's speed
is unbeatable.@0003
But still, I'm more
stable on foot...@0003
@0009@0017You said it was dangerous to try
new ways of fighting in battle.@0003
@000C...Oh, I did, didn't I?@0003
I only tried it for a bit.
It's okay.@0003
@0009If you want the advantage of a horse's
speed, you can ride behind me.@0003
@000C@0017That's all right with you?@0003
@0009@0017I don't think you'll be able
to shoot very well, though...@0003
@000C@0017Shoot? I don't think I'd be able
to stay on, let alone shoot!@0003
I think I'll stay on the ground.
It feels more natural to me.@0003
@0009Ha ha ha.
That is probably for the best.@0003
[035D]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0110
@000CAre you Dayan
the Silver Wolf?@0003
@0009@0017
You are not Sacaen, and
yet you know my name...@0003
How do you know of me?@0003
@000C@0017
I treated a wounded Sacaen
once in the past.@0003
It was then I heard of the
unrivaled warrior of Sacae.@0003
With a name like Silver Wolf,@0003
I expected someone with
white hair like mine.@0003
@0009@0017
The name Silver Wolf
comes from our history.@0003
Our legends say that our
ancestors were wolves.@0003
@000CAh, I didn't know that.@0003
@0009
Do you need something from me?@0003
If you come to preach, I already
have deities I worship.@0003
@000C@0017
No, I did not
come to preach.@0003
@0009@0017...Are you sure? Don't you need
to serve your gods?@0003
@000C@0017Of course. My mission is to guide
those in need of direction.@0003
But you Sacaens already
worship the Sky and the Earth.@0003
The gods would not look fondly on
me for pushing my beliefs upon you.@0003
@0009@0017...I see.@0003
[035E]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0110
@0009@0017We Sacaens pray to the Sky and the Earth.@0003
The light of day and the darkness of night
that engulf the land...@0003
They produce wind, lightning, fire, ice,
and other affinities...@0003
Every person in this world is protected
by one of these elements.@0003
According to my clan's beliefs, I am
protected by the anima affinity.@0003
@000C@0017Interesting that
you believe so.@0003
@0009@0017What do you mean?@0003
@000C@0017The St. Elimine Church has
similar beliefs.@0003
When the creators made man, all
mankind was blessed with an affinity.@0003
However...those elements...@0003
@0009@0017...Those elements hold no power
on their own.@0003
@000C@0017Exactly.@0003
@0009Hm... Interesting indeed.@0003
@000CYes. Perhaps...@0003
Perhaps this is one of the
grand truths of the world.@0003
[035F]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0110@0009@0017The seven affinities...@0003
Their effects only appear
through bonds with others.@0003
When your heart is linked
with someone else's...@0003
That is when the elements
reveal their true power.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, precisely.@0003
Saint Elimine said to
cherish our relationships.@0003
@0009@0017Hmm...@0003
I wonder if our hearts
have linked somehow.@0003
@000C@0017I am sure of it.@0003
Though who knows what
effect that may have...@0003
[0360]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@012F@000C@0017Hey...
What that?@0003
@0009Hm?@0003
Haven't you seen eastern bows before?
This is a bow we use for training.@0003
@000CI-I can see?@0003
@0009All right. Here.
Try pulling the string.@0003
@000CPull good?@0003
@0009You're incredibly strong.@0003
A normal man wouldn't be able
to pull it at all.@0003
@000CI-I strong.@0003
@0009Now, try firing
this arrow...@0003
@000CH-huh?@0003
@0009First, you put the
arrow here...@0003
@000CPut arrow here...@0003
@0009Now let go.@0003
@000CLet go...@0003@0002
@000CUgh.@0003@0011
@0009Gonzalez!
Are you all right?@0003
@000CArrow hit me...@0003
[0361]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@012F@0009@0017
Let me see your head.
Yes... It looks better.@0003
@000C
Uh...
No more bow.@0003
What that horse?
Strange color.@0003
@0009
Ah, it looks different from the
horses in your home, doesn't it?@0003
We use these horses as a way
of life in Sacae.@0003
We can also keep up with the mounts
that western knights ride upon.@0003
@000CI-I want ride...@0003@0002
Guh.@0080@0011@0003
@0009Gonzalez!
Are you all right?@0003
Horses are very sensitive to
people standing behind them.@0003
You have to be careful.@0003
@000C...Ow...
Horse kick me...@0003
[0362]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@012F@0009@0017I'm sorry, Gonzalez.@0003
It seems that you get hurt
whenever you are with me.@0003
@000CIt OK.@0003
@0009Here, I'll give you
this as an apology.@0003
@000CWhat this?@0003
@0009It's a headdress that we of the
Kutolah clan wear.@0003
It would suit a fine warrior
like you nicely.@0003
@000C...I like.@0003
@0009Take this as well.@0003
It's a wine made from horse milk.
We drink it at festivities.@0003
@000CI happy.
I drink.@0003
@0009Wait, don't...
drink so much...@0003
@000CUh?@0003
Uhwuhwuh?@0003@0011
@0009Gonzalez!
Can you get up?@0003
This wine is very strong.@0003
You shouldn't drink so much
of it at once.@0003
@000CUhwuhwuhhh...@0003
[0363]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0114@000C@0017You...@0003
You're the Silver Wolf...@0003
@0009You are a warrior of Sacae.
What is your name?@0003
@000CRutger.@0003
...I was at Bulgar.@0003
@0009Bulgar...@0003
You survived.@0003
I heard that most of the
people there were killed...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016That day...@0003
I learned that it is the strong
who consume the weak in nature.@0003
That is true anywhere, be it
Sacae...or Bern!@0003
@0009Then...is that the reason
you are here?@0003
To become strong and take
your revenge on Bern...?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
[0364]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0114@0009@0017Rutger.@0003
You fight for revenge.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016What will you do once
you have vengeance?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009I ask you once more...@0003
What do you plan to do
after avenging your clan?@0003
@000C...You don't need to know.@0003
@0009Will you...dedicate your
life to revenge?@0003
Will you be happy with that?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016You want me to keep quiet, even
after seeing my entire clan killed?@0003
...You suffered the same as I
have. You must understand.@0003
@0009That is not what I am saying.
We are men of Sacae.@0003
Those who desecrate our land
must pay.@0003
However...even if we do win this
war and destroy Bern,@0003
the deceased will never return.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Revenge will not bring back
that which you've lost.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016I know no other
way to live.@0003
[0365]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0114@0009@0017Rutger.@0003
What will you do when the war is over?
Do you have a place to go?@0003
@000C...No.@0003
@0009As I thought.@0003
Would you join
the Kutolah?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Our clan lost its battle,
but its soul lives on.@0003
Once the war ends, we will gather
in the plains once more.@0003
I think you could be a great
help to us.@0003
@000C...I don't accept charity.@0003
@0009It is not charity.@0003
I ask you because I have faith
in your strength as a warrior.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016
Hm...
A difficult person, I see.@0003
Then I shall say no more.@0003
But remember that if you
ever change your mind,@0003
we will welcome you with
open arms.@0003
Whatever happens to you...
don't forget that.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0002
@0016...I won't.@0003
[0366]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0122@000C
Barthe. I haven't thanked
you yet, have I?@0003
@0009@0017Thanked me?@0003
@000C@0017You came to rescue me.@0003
@0009@0017Oh, that.@0003
Such is my duty as a knight,
milady.@0003
If anything, I should apologize
that we didn't arrive sooner.@0003
@000CBarthe...
I'm sorry.@0003
I can never repay
you for that...@0003
@0017Oh, I know. Here, take
this necklace.@0003
@0009@0017Lady Lilina, please.@0003
We do not fight for
reward.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
@0009@0017
You are safe.@0003
That in itself is
reward enough.@0003
@000CThank you, Barthe...@0003
[0367]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0122@000CBarthe.@0003
Do you know what Debias
and Legance did?@0003
@0009@0017
All I know is that they made contact
with Bern to start the rebellion.@0003
However, I have heard many other
troubling rumors about them as well.@0003
I hear they used their positions
to illegally seize money.@0003
@000CReally...?@0003
@0009The rebellion was in planning
before Bern even invaded.@0003
Astolfo found proof of that.@0003
@000CYes...
I was foolish.@0003
They served my father so...
I didn't want to suspect them.@0003
I wanted to trust them simply
because they were our vassals.@0003
@0009But that trust is what
put you in danger...@0003
@000CYes, exactly...
I'm truly sorry, Barthe...@0003
@0009Lady Lilina, your safety is the
most important thing of all.@0003
Without a master to whom we can
pledge our loyalty,@0003
we surely cannot be called
knights at all.@0003
[0368]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0122
@000C@0017Barthe...@0003
What do you think will happen
to Ostia without my father?@0003
@0009Someone needs to rebuild it after the
war is over, or it will fall into chaos.@0003
That someone is you, Lady Lilina.@0003
@000CBut...I'm not sure I'm qualified.@0003
I'll only get in the way and keep
everyone from doing their jobs...@0003
You...must think so, too.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
I know not how those in power
should act, but...@0003@0002
When you told me you wanted to
trust your vassals,@0003
I do not think you were mistaken.@0003
Indeed, you should have been able
to trust them above all others.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016
No matter the path you follow,
no matter how you doubt yourself,@0003
we true knights will always swear
our undying loyalty to you.@0003
[0369]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0116
@0009@0017Ogier.@0003
@000CSir Barthe.@0003
@0009Have you been keeping
up with your training?@0003
@000COf course.@0003
@0009...I've been wanting
to ask you.@0003
Why did you not
become a knight?@0003
Why did you become
a mercenary?@0003
@000CHeavy armor doesn't
really suit me.@0003
@0009That is simply because you don't
train yourself hard enough.@0003
@000CBut, I mean,
I wasn't born with--@0003
@0009This is a perfect opportunity.
I shall train you every day.@0003
I will make a knight of you yet.@0003
@000CAre you sure...?@0003
[036A]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0116
@000C@0017Sir Barthe...
This training is just...crazy.@0003
@0009You'll get used to it soon enough.@0003
I do it every day.@0003
@000CYes, but I don't have the
build that you do...@0003
@0009Was that a complaint
I heard just now?@0003
@000CNo...@0003
@0009Then keep quiet
and train harder.@0003
@000CYes, sir...@0003
[036B]
@0009@0010@0108@0009@0017Hm?@0003
Are those practice
swings I hear...?@0003
@0011@0006@000C@0010@0116
@000CWhew...@0003
I wonder if I'm any closer
to Sir Barthe by now.@0003
@0009@0010@0108Ogier.@0003
@000CWhoa!@0003
Oh, Sir Barthe!
You scared me.@0003
@0009@0017You are doing well.
Excellent.@0003
Your body has gotten
used to the training.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I feel uncomfortable if
I'm not working my body.@0003
I'd hate to fail for lack
of training.@0003
@0009@0017I see you have learned your lesson.@0003
If you train yourself constantly,
you will never tire in battle.@0003
That holds true both for knights
like me and mercenaries like you.@0003
@000C@0017Mercenaries like me?@0003
But I thought you wanted
to make me a knight.@0003
@0009@0017I only said that to make you
train harder.@0003
I know your build can't
handle heavy armor.@0003
@000C@0017Really?@0003
@0009@0017It encouraged you,
didn't it?@0003
@000C@0017Did it?@0003
I'd say it made me suffer
more than anything...@0003
@0009What was that?@0003
@000CNothing...@0003
[036C]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0109@000C
Ah, Barthe.
Long time no see.@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
@0017You seem to have improved
a great deal.@0003
@000CThere were many tough battles in
our journey from Lycia to Ostia.@0003
@0009Well, it's not as if I was just
sitting around in Ostia, either.@0003
I trained at the arena,
preparing for battle.@0003
@000C...I remember that arena.@0003
I have to say, though...
I don't really approve of that.@0003
A knight, fighting for money?
It's almost a contradiction...@0003
@0009No one has need of
a weak knight.@0003
I train myself to
prevail in battle.@0003
@000C@0017Heh. You haven't
changed at all.@0003
@0009Neither have you...oaf.@0003
[036D]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0109@000C@0017Barthe...
Were you able to accept it?@0003
@0009Accept what?@0003
@000CNot going into battle
alongside Lord Hector.@0003
You've always said that a
knight's purpose is to fight.@0003
@0009...I would certainly say I was
disappointed at first.@0003
But staying and protecting the castle
and Lady Lilina was its own battle.@0003
@000CThat's for sure...@0003
@0009But I allowed Lady Lilina to fall
into the hands of the enemy.@0003
That was my failure.
I was naive...@0003
Somewhere in my heart, I wanted
to believe that Ostia was secure.@0003
@000CDon't blame yourself...
You always do that.@0003
@0009That's true. I do...@0003
@0017Whenever I talk to you, I always
seem to reveal my true feelings.@0003
@000CWe've been friends ever since we
we were knighted.@0003
We couldn't hide something from
one another even if we tried.@0003
@0009Ha ha ha...
You're right about that.@0003
[036E]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0109@0009@0017Bors,
I always wanted to ask you...@0003
@000CAsk me what?@0003
@0009Why did you become
a knight?@0003
@000CBecause I want to protect
the ones I love.@0003
@0009Admirable.@0003
@000CAnd you?@0003
@0009I became a knight because they
are the strongest fighters.@0003
I don't believe any can match a
knight in a one-on-one battle.@0003
...That's why I couldn't protect
Lady Lilina...@0003
We faced a whole army of armored
knights.@0003
@000CBlaming yourself again?@0003
@0009It only happened because I
wasn't strong enough.@0003
If I had enough power to stop
the rebellion myself,@0003
I could have contained the
situation.@0003
I must become stronger still.@0003
@000C@0017...Then become a lance
sharper than any other.@0003
And I shall be your
impervious shield.@0003
@0009@0017A lance and shield...@0003
@000C@0017
An unstoppable lance and an
unbreakable shield.@0003
@0009That sounds like a plan,
friend!@0003
[036F]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@01BD@000CSir Barthe!
Are you all right?@0003
@0009@0017Of course.@0003
Do you expect me to lose
to weaklings like these?@0003
@000C@0017No, never.@0003
@0009@0017Then I won't ask you
how you're doing.@0003
We knights of Ostia are
always at our peak.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, sir.@0003
@0009@0017I appreciate your concern for me,@0003
but worry about yourself before
you worry about others.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, sir.@0003
[0370]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@01BD@0009@0017What's the matter, Gwendolyn?
You're panting.@0003
A knight of Ostia shouldn't be heaving
after a light battle like that.@0003
@000CYes, I'm sorry, sir.@0003
@0009Remember our training, Gwendolyn!@0003
Remember how we sprint-marched
over that mountain.@0003
This is nothing compared
to that!@0003
@000CYes, sir!@0003
@0009Show the enemy...why they should
fear the knights of Ostia!@0003
@000C@0017Yes, sir!@0003
[0371]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@01BD@000CSir Barthe, how can I
improve myself further?@0003
@0009@0017You're a full-fledged
knight of Ostia now, Gwendolyn.@0003
I have no criticisms to
offer you.@0003
@000C@0017Thank you, sir!@0003@0017
But...Sir Barthe...@0003
Anything will do.
Say anything.@0003
@0009Say anything?
What?@0003
@000CUh...@0003
I'm sure there is something
I could improve in...@0003
@0009No.@0003
You must critique
yourself now.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
@0009What's the matter?
Why do you look so discouraged?@0003
@000CI...I want you to
teach me more...@0003
@0009Sorry?@0003
@000CI don't...want you to
leave me, Sir Barthe...@0003
@0009What are you
talking about?@0003
We fight together
as equals.@0003
I won't leave you.@0003
@000C@0017Truly?@0003
@0009@0017Of course.@0003
...We can afford to waste no
more time talking like this.@0003
Let's move, Gwendolyn!@0003
@000C@0017Yes, sir!@0003
[0372]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@011D@0009@0017
It seems Bern was working behind the
scenes even before the war started.@0003
@000CYeah. The traitors to the Lycian
League, the rebellion at Ostia...@0003
All according to their plan.@0003
Of course, I'm to blame for that.
I didn't realize soon enough.@0003
@0009The betrayals and
Lord Hector's death...@0003
We all share the blame.
It wasn't just you.@0003
@000CNah, it was me.@0003
The mistakes I made...
They were just too egregious.@0003
@0009...We must keep our eyes sharp so that
such a tragedy does not happen again.@0003
@000CYeah, traitors and spies
could be anywhere.@0003
Possibly even in
this army.@0003
@0009What...?!@0003
You know of a traitor
in our ranks?!@0003
@000CWell...no.@0003
But if I learned anything
from Lord Hector's death,@0003
it's that we can't be
too careful.@0003
[0373]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@011D@0009@0017Astolfo...
About potential traitors.@0003
@000CYeah?@0003
@0009Do you have any suspects?@0003
@000CNo, not yet.
I'm looking into it.@0003
@0009Once you think about who might
be a traitor...@0003
any number of soldiers could betray
us for any number of reasons.@0003
@000CYeah, we've got people
from just about everywhere.@0003
I'll have to go through them
individually, one by one...@0003
It won't be easy, I can tell
you that.@0003
@0009The most obvious suspect
would be that princess...@0003
@000CGuinivere, princess of Bern. There is
something suspicious about her.@0003
@0009Lord Roy trusts her.
I don't want to think that she...@0003
@000CStill...@0003
@0009Our comrades would lose all trust in us if they
found out we suspect them of betrayal...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016It's rough, isn't it?
But someone's got to do it.@0003
[0374]
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@011D@0009@0017Astolfo.
...How did the search go?@0003
@000CYeah, about that.@0003
It took a while, but I feel confident
that there are no traitors.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
@000CPrincess Guinivere genuinely trusts
Lord Roy. And so does everyone else.@0003
This ragtag group has a stronger
bond than you might think.@0003
@0009Good...
That's a relief.@0003
@000CUh-huh. So that's taken
care of.@0003
I'll keep an eye on any new
recruits who join up, too.@0003
@0009I'm sorry to make you do
all the dirty work...@0003
@000C@0017Hey, don't let it bother you.
It's what I do.@0003
[0375]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0109@000C@0017Lady Lilina...@0003
Has something been bothering
you lately?@0003
@0009What...?
No, I'm fine.@0003
@000CAre you sure...?@0003
I was given special orders by Lord
Hector to protect you at all costs.@0003
@0009So?@0003
@000CSo if something has happened, you should
tell me so I can protect you adequately...@0003
@0009I told you!
Nothing's wrong!@0003
@000CB-but normally, milady, you aren't
quite this...touchy...@0003
@0009Touchy?!
I'm not touchy!@0003
@000CYes, milady, but--@0003
@0009Silence, Bors!
You're annoying me.@0003
@000CW-where are you going, milady?@0003
@0009Someplace where I won't
have to listen to you.@0003
@000CLady Lilina!@0003
[0376]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0109@0009@0017Bors, erm...
about before...@0003
@000CBefore?@0003
@0009I wanted to apologize.@0003
@000CTo me?@0003
@0009You were just concerned for me,
and I blew up at you...@0003
I'm sorry.@0003
@000CPlease...don't be.@0003
@0009...Will you hear why
I'm so irritable?@0003
I think I need
someone to talk to...@0003
@000CIf I may,
then of course.@0003
@0009It's about Roy...
What do you think about him?@0003
@000CI think he has grown splendidly into
a wise and caring leader to us all.@0003
@0009But the Roy I know had
mismatched buttons on his suit,@0003
and he couldn't do even one
step of a dance...@0003
I always thought I had to
take care of him.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016But Roy's suddenly changed.
He's gotten so...grown up, you know?@0003
He seems so far away now...@0003
@000C...Milady, Lord Roy has not
changed as much as you think.@0003
@0009Really?@0003
@000CHe has certainly matured, but his
nature is still the same.@0003
Lord Roy is still the same person
you know him to be within.@0003
@0009Yes, you're right...@0003
Thank you for lending me
your ear, Bors.@0003
@000COf course, milady.@0003
[0377]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0109@000CYou look much better
today, milady.@0003
@0009Yes, I feel much better, too.@0003
@000CThat is good to hear.@0003
@0009@0017It's not as if Roy was avoiding
me or anything...@0003
It's just that he seemed to be changing,
and I felt I was left behind.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I jumped to conclusions and
fretted over nothing...@0003
Once I realized that, it
suddenly seemed so silly.@0003
@0017I'm still a child, aren't I?@0003
@000C@0017Lady Lilina...@0003
@0009@0017Bors, will you stay
by my side?@0003
@000C...I am a knight, and my
loyalty lies with you.@0003
I shall always be at your
side, ready to serve.@0003
@0009Thank you, Bors...@0003
[0378]
@0009@0010@01BD@000C@0010@0109
@0009@0017Bors?@0003
@000C@0017O-oh! Hello, Gwendolyn.@0003
What a...uh...coincidence!@0003
@0009@0017It is good to see you well.
Do you need something, Brother?@0003
@000C@0017No...I don't.@0003
I was just walking around
and I ran into you. Yes.@0003
@0009@0017OK...@0003
@000C@0017Are you hurt? Your armor
isn't too heavy?@0003
@0009@0017No, I am fine, Brother.
I must be off, though...@0003
@000C@0017Leaving already?
You could rest a bit longer...@0003
@0009@0017Thank you for your consideration,
but this is a battle.@0003
@000CY-yes, of course...
Take care.@0003
[0379]
@0009@0010@01BD@000C@0010@0109
@0009@0017...Bors?@0003
@000C@0017Oh, Gwendolyn...@0003
Running in to you like this...
Pure coincidence, yet again...@0003
@0009@0017Is something...wrong?@0003
@000C@0017Ah, no, it's nothing.@0003
Why don't we talk a
little, though?@0003
You're not hurt?
Your armor's not too heavy?@0003
@0009@0017No, I'm fine.
Thanks for the concern.@0003
@000C@0017Are you taking care of
your lance and helmet?@0003
@0009@0017Yes, of course.@0003
@000C@0017Are you eating properly?@0003
Do you have any worries that
you want to talk about?@0003
@0009@0017I'm fine.@0003
@000C@0017Have you made any friends?@0003
Any boyfriends I should
know about...?@0003
[037A]
@0009@0010@01BD@000C@0010@0109
@0009@0017Bors...@0003
@000C@0017G-Gwendolyn! We certainly
meet a lot...@0003
@0009@0017Yes, Brother.
Do you need something?@0003
@000C@0017No, nothing.
Just...@0003
@0009@0017Bors...@0003
@000C@0017Hm?@0003
@0009@0017I am truly grateful for
your concern.@0003
But I am a knight of Ostia.@0003
I'm training myself so I
can be like you.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009If I'm to become strong, I can't
depend upon you all the time.@0003
I'm fine, really, so please
don't worry...@0003
...I'm grateful to have a
brother like you.@0003
But if you'll excuse me.@0003@0011@0007
@000C@0017@0016......@0003@0016
...Dear me...
She's grown so much.@0003
I suppose I was being
childish...@0003@0002
Gwendolyn, I wish you luck.@0003
[037B]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@0109@0009Heya, Bors.@0003
@000C@0017Astolfo...
Is something the matter?@0003
@0009@0017Nah, it's nothing.
I just wanted to say hi.@0003
Ha ha ha...@0003
@000C@0017@0016......@0003
@0016That smell...
Have you been drinking?@0003
@0009@0017Maybe a little. I was bored
so I decided to have a swig...@0003
@000C@0017Bored? This is the
middle of a battle...@0003
@0009@0017Hey, all I can do is open
chests and doors anyway...@0003
Not like I can fight or do
anything worthwhile.@0003
I'll get out of your hair so
you can get back to fighting...@0003
@0011@000C@0016......@0003
[037C]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@0109@0009
Oh, Bors.
Long time no see.@0003
@000C@0017Astolfo...@0003
I think you should refrain
from...imbibing as you do.@0003
The younger recruits are watching,
and you're setting a bad example.@0003
@0009Bors...@0003
@000C...Yes?@0003
@0009I'm sorry...
about Lord Hector...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016
I knew there was a traitor
to the Lycian League...@0003
If I'd done my job properly,
we wouldn't be in this state...@0003
Lord Hector wouldn't have
lost...if I'd...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016That was not
your fault.@0003
@0009
And, you know...
The rebellion.@0003
It should have
been obvious...@0003
But I couldn't do
anything about it...@0003
Heh, I'm just a
worthless sack...@0003
You must really
hate me...@0003
I'm a joke of a
spy...@0003
Ha ha...ha...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Rats...
I'm out of sauce...@0003
[037D]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@0109@000C@0017Astolfo.@0003
@0009@0017Huh...?
Oh, Bors.@0003
Come have a drink
with me...@0003
@000C@0017Stop blaming yourself.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016We lost Lord Hector. The
responsibility lies in all of us.@0003
But...still...we must not dwell
on the past.@0003
We must look forward.@0003
We must do as Lord Hector would
have wanted.@0003
We need you, Astolfo.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016...Why?@0003
Why are you...defending a
useless wretch like me...?@0003
@000CBecause you are a
knight of Ostia.@0003
@0009...A knight?
Who...? Me?@0003
@000CYou may not have been
knighted...@0003
But you put your life on
the line for Lord Hector.@0003
That is more than enough
to make you a knight.@0003
At least, I think so.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016...Bors...I...@0003
@000C@0017Astolfo, let us move forward...
and make our master proud.@0003
[037E]
@0009@0010@0109@000C@0010@0116@000C
Sir Bors? You are Sir Bors,
aren't you?@0003
@0009@0017Oh...
And you are?@0003
@000C@0017I'm Ogier of the Ostian knights.
I heard about you from Gwendolyn.@0003
@0009@0017Ah, my sister... So you're
our newest recruit?@0003
@000C@0017Yes. I'm pleased
to meet you.@0003
@0009I wish I could say the same...
but you don't look like a knight.@0003
@000CYes, well, I try to fill in the gaps
that our squad falls short in.@0003
@0009Ah, I see.
Most admirable.@0003
Not everyone has
that ability.@0003
@000CThank you, sir.@0003
[037F]
@0009@0010@0109@000C@0010@0116@000C@0017I heard from Sir Barthe that you
beat him once in combat.@0003
Is that true?@0003
@0009Yes, I did.@0003
It was just once, in a great
tournament held in Ostia.@0003
@000CWhat was the battle like?@0003
@0009To tell the truth, I actually
don't remember it very well.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
The battle with Sir Barthe was so
boring that you forgot about it?@0003
@0009Oh, no, nothing of that sort.@0003
It was because I don't like to
fight for the sake of fighting.@0003
I didn't want to join so I had
no interest in the tournament.@0003
I've forgotten most of what
happened.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009Ogier, you must always
fight for a cause.@0003
You must never fight simply
for the sake of fighting.@0003
[0380]
@0009@0010@0109@000C@0010@0116@000CSir Bors, you said that one must
always have a cause to fight for.@0003
@0009@0017Indeed I did.@0003
You must be willing to go through any
and all hardships for that cause.@0003
Do you have such a purpose?@0003
@000CUnfortunately, I don't.@0003
I only became a mercenary
to feed my family.@0003
So I don't really have
a cause...@0003
@0009@0017You've got one right there.@0003
@000C@0017What?@0003
@0009@0017Feeding your family is a
noble cause.@0003
Train yourself to become stronger,
all for your family.@0003
@000CY-yes, sir, I will!@0003
@0009A cause isn't limited to defending
your country or saving the world.@0003
If you understand that, then you
will fight with the best.@0003
[0381]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@01BD
@0009Hello, Gwendolyn.@0003
@000C@0017Lady Lilina...
Please stay close to me.@0003
I shall protect you
with my life.@0003
@0009@0017Th-thank you...@0003
That armor... It's quite a
feat that you can wear it.@0003
Isn't it heavy for someone
of your build?@0003
@000C@0017No, milady.@0003
The weight of a knight's armor
is the symbol of their loyalty.@0003
@0009All right...
Just don't strain yourself.@0003
@000CThank you very much,
milady.@0003
@0009@0017Why did you become a knight?
Did you want to be like Bors?@0003
@000C@0017Yes... I want to be
just like my brother.@0003
I wish to protect
you as he does.@0003
[0382]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@01BD@0009Gwendolyn.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, Lady Lilina?@0003
@0009@0017Let's chat a bit.
Tell me about yourself.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, milady.@0003
I am a knight of Ostia
and I serve--@0003
@0009@0017No, I know that...
I meant more interesting things.@0003
For example, are there any men
you fancy?@0003
@000C@0017M...men?@0003
@0009@0017That's right.@0003
@000C@0017I...don't really know.@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
@000C@0017I've always been focused on becoming
strong like my brother, so...@0003
I've never really thought about
things like that...@0003
@0009Really...?@0003
@0017Let's talk about something
else then.@0003
We're in this together and we
grew up in the same land.@0003
Plus, we're both girls.@0003
I want to get to know
you better.@0003
[0383]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@01BD@000C@0017Lady Lilina,
you are an odd individual.@0003
@0009@0017Odd?
How so?@0003
@000C@0017You are in a much higher position
than I...@0003
Yet you still chat lightly to me
with a smile on your face.@0003
It seems...odd.@0003
@0009@0017
Do you think so? I just want
to be friends with you.@0003
@000C@0017F-friends?@0003
I don't think that would be
appropriate, milady...@0003
You are my mistress!@0003
@0009@0017That doesn't matter.@0003
You're the only girl around
my age from Ostia.@0003
Let's not worry about positions
like mistress or vassal...@0003
@000C@0017Lady Lilina!@0003
You carry Ostia's future
on your shoulders.@0003
You are different from us.@0003
You do understand that,
don't you?@0003
@0009...So we can't be friends?@0003
@000CI'm sorry, though I am very
grateful for your consideration.@0003
Perhaps we cannot be friends,@0003
but I would enjoy chatting with
you once in a while as before.@0003
@0009@0017Of course!@0003
...Thank you, Gwendolyn.@0003
[0384]
@0009@0010@01BD@000C@0010@0116@000CWhat are you doing,
Gwendolyn?@0003
@0009@0017I'm practicing my walking.@0003
@000CWalking?
Why?@0003
@0009For us knights, it's tough to get
back up if we fall to the ground.@0003
We have to build strong legs to
ensure that we never fall.@0003
@000CI see.@0003
@0009The basics are everything, Ogier.@0003
[0385]
@000C@0010@0116@000C@0017Yah! Yah!@0003
@0009@0010@01BDOgier, are you practicing
your sword swings?@0003
@000CThat I am.@0003
I can't let you get ahead of me,@0003
so I thought I'd practice
the basics, too.@0003
@0009That's good.@0003
But it'll take a lot
of work to beat me.@0003
@000CI suppose we've got a little
competition going, then!@0003
[0386]
@0009@0010@01BD@000C@0010@0116@000CHow are you doing,
Gwendolyn?@0003
@0009@0017Perfectly fine, of course.@0003
A strong knight can't
complain.@0003
@000CMe neither. Not if I want to
be a powerful mercenary...@0003
@0009...Thank you, Ogier.@0003
@000CF-for what?@0003
@0009Our competition has kept
me working hard.@0003
I'd have probably given up
by now if not for you.@0003
@000C...I feel the same way.@0003
I've been able to come
so far thanks to you.@0003
We're evenly matched.@0003
@0009I agree.@0003
But I'll never let
you get ahead of me.@0003
@000CRight back at you,
Gwendolyn!@0003
[0387]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@01BD@000C@0017Sir Astolfo.@0003
@0009@0017Hm? Oh...
You're Bors' younger sister.@0003
@000C@0017What are you doing back here?@0003
You have light gear.
You should be well ahead of us.@0003
@0009@0017Uh... Yeah, sorry.@0003
This leg doesn't work
the way it used to...@0003
@000C@0017
...Sir Astolfo, just how
old are you?@0003
Perhaps you should retire
if your body can't keep up.@0003
@0009@0017You're even more austere
than your brother.@0003
...And you have the same
physical build, too.@0003
A girl your age should
really watch her weight.@0003
@000C@0017I don't have a weight problem!
This is my armor!@0003
@0009@0017OK, OK, sure.
Just calm down...@0003
@000C@0017I think you could learn a
thing or two from my brother.@0003
[0388]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@01BD@000C@0017Sir Astolfo!@0003
@0009@0017Hey, Gwendolyn.
How's it going?@0003
@000C@0017...Sir Astolfo...@0003
You can't sit here and
rest like this...@0003
This is a battlefield!
It's serious!@0003
@0009@0017What's the point in getting
fired up over nothing?@0003
Relax. Why don't you join me?
Take your shoes off.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017
I won't let this slide.@0003
You leave me no choice! I'll
have to drag you to battle!@0003
@0009Hey there...
Slow down...@0003
@0080@000B
@000CS-Sir Astolfo...
That wound...@0003
@0009@0017Oh... This?
It's just an old scar.@0003
This leg is pretty useless
because of it, though.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017When...did you get that wound?@0003
@0009@0017Hmm... A long time ago.@0003
I messed up on a reconnaissance
mission in Castle Bern.@0003
I did get away though, so it's
like a trophy to me.@0003
@000C@0017I...@0003
I'm sorry!
I didn't know...@0003
@0009Yeah, whatever.
Don't worry about it...@0003
[0389]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@01BD@000C@0017Sir Astolfo!@0003
@0009@0017Ah, Gwendolyn. Come to grace
me with your beauty?@0003
@000C@0017I will not be swayed by flattery.
I know your leg slows you down.@0003
But! You have other habits that
are not excusable!@0003
First, you imbibe far more than
is acceptable...@0003
@0009...Oh, brother...@0003
@000CI will not let you laze
about as you do.@0003
You must behave like a
proper Ostian knight!@0003
@0009Yeah, whatever...@0003
[038A]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@010A@000C@0017Prince Myrddin...!@0003
What's wrong?!
Your eyes...@0003
@0009That voice...
Is that you, Douglas?@0003
@000CYou cannot see, Your Highness?
I thought your eyes had recovered...@0003
@0009I still go blind for
a while sometimes...@0003
I will be fine once
I rest.@0003
@000C...I heard that the poison rendered
you blind for several months...@0003
Forgive me, my prince...@0003
If only I had been on guard, you would
never have suffered this fate...@0003
@0009...I wonder how...
my father is doing.@0003
Is he any better?@0003
@000CI regret to say that he
is not, Your Highness.@0003
He does not know that
you yet live.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000CBut I am sure he will be rejuvenized
once you return to the palace.@0003
He will recover...and so will
our nation.@0003
[038B]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@010A@000C@0017My prince,@0003
General Roy's tactics are upsetting
the balance of power on the continent.@0003
@0009@0017Yes... So it seems.@0003
@000C@0017It will not be long before this army
conquers the entirety of Elibe.@0003
I believe that will be the ideal time to
announce your return to the throne...@0003
@0009Douglas...
Regarding that matter.@0003
@000CYes, Prince Myrddin?@0003
@0009I have hesitations about
returning to Etruria...@0003
@000CWhat are you saying?!@0003
Everyone would be so
delighted to see you safe...@0003
@0009Douglas.@0003
I learned much in my time with the
resistance in the Western Isles.@0003
Too much, in fact.@0003
I witnessed innocents treated like
animals under corrupt Etrurian lords.@0003
If not for the attempt on my life,
I probably would never have known.@0003
@000CThat is all the more reason to return.
You can rid us of such atrocities...@0003
@0009I promise I will return to
the palace someday.@0003
But for now...@0003
I want to be with the people.
They need my protection.@0003
[038C]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@010A
@000CPrince Myrddin...@0003
@0009@0017Don't call me that...
I am but a simple bard here.@0003
I am not your prince,
and you are not my general.@0003
You can accept that for
the time being, can't you?@0003
@000C...If I must.@0003
In that case, I pledge my loyalty not
as your general, but as a dear friend.@0003
@0009...You are as
unbending as ever.@0003
@000CMy unwavering will
is my strength.@0003
@0009...This war will end soon.@0003
General Roy may be young,
but he understands the people.@0003
He will lead the whole continent
to a gilded age of peace.@0003
@000CYes, I concur.@0003
@0009It's my duty to serve the people
as well, however.@0003
I don't intend to lax in my
own duties.@0003
@000CI shall be at your side
no matter where you go.@0003
[038D]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@010A@000C@0017Geese.@0003
@0009Hey...
Long time no see.@0003
@000CI want to thank you for
what you've done.@0003
I understand that you safely
escorted Pr--@0003
I mean, Elffin to the
Western Isles.@0003
@0009Yeah, I did what I could.@0003
That bard was an interesting guy.@0003
The girl he came with was seasick
the whole time, though.@0003
@000CI see...
Geese, I must apologize.@0003
I misjudged you.@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000CThe assassins were still after Elffin,
so I couldn't put him on a large ship.@0003
He would have been found immediately.@0003
You were my only option.@0003
But being a pirate, I didn't
trust you completely.@0003
Even so, you kept your word.
For that, I thank you.@0003
@0009Sure...
No problem.@0003
@000CYou could have turned him over to the
revolutionaries for a hefty reward.@0003
Why did you choose to help him?@0003
It didn't make you much money.@0003
@0009@0017...Well, helping people makes
me feel warm and fuzzy inside.@0003
I sure can't say the same
thing about piracy.@0003
[038E]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@010A@0009@0017Hey.@0003
@000CGeese, I feel I must
reward you somehow.@0003
@0009Reward me?@0003
@000CYou saved our
country.@0003
I will give you
anything you ask.@0003
@0009Don't be ridiculous... I already got
the payment you promised me.@0003
@000CNo... That paltry sum doesn't
suffice for what you've done.@0003
You are a hero to the
Etrurian people.@0003
@0009I'm a hero? What are you on about?
The guy's just a bard.@0003
I mean, I guess he ended up
liberating the Western Isles, but...@0003
@000CGeese... There is
something you should know...@0003
@0016......@0003@0016
...Hmm...@0003
@0009Yeah?@0003
@000C...I'm sorry.
I cannot tell you now.@0003
@0009Yeesh...
Way to leave me hanging.@0003
@000CIn any case...@0003
I hear that you helped the people
living in the Isles as well.@0003
Our king and prince had
wished them to be free.@0003
You did our nation a
great service.@0003
@0009Well, I hate to burst your bubble...@0003
@0017But I don't care about politics or
nations or any of that in the least.@0003
I just wanted to pay the villagers
back for helping me out.@0003
[038F]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@010A@0009@0017...You're just not gonna
leave me be, are you?@0003
@000CAbsolutely not.
You have done me a great favor.@0003
It would be a dishonor on my
name if I didn't return it.@0003
@0009You knights are so hard-headed.@0003
I swear, if you found a coin lying
in the street,@0003
you'd leave it out of honor or
loyalty or some nonsense.@0003
@000CGeese...@0003
@0009Sigh...
Fine, let me think...@0003
@0017...All right, here's what I want.@0003
I want you and your king to
run a good country.@0003
Don't go around causing
pointless wars.@0003
And make sure people can travel
and do business safely.@0003
I'm gonna go bankrupt if you
don't do that for me.@0003
@000C@0017...Geese...@0003
You deserve better than the
life of a pirate.@0003
I swear on my life that
I will fulfill your requests!@0003
[0390]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@011B@000C@0017Excuse me.@0003
Are you Lord Douglas
of Etruria?@0003
@0009Yes, that is me.@0003
@000CSo you are the
Great General?@0003
@0009I am but a simple
soldier now.@0003
@000CIs that so...@0003
I am Igrene,
Guardian of Nabata.@0003
@0009Nabata...@0003
@000CYes, I fend off invaders
in the desert heat.@0003
@0009Quite a job you have.@0003
Do you need something
from me?@0003
@000CI want you to promise me that
you will never attack Nabata.@0003
@0009...I cannot promise you that.@0003
@000CWhy not?@0003
@0009I am a knight...@0003
If the king orders an
attack, I must obey.@0003
@000CEven if you know
it to be wrong?@0003
@0009Such is a
knight's duty.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
[0391]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@011B@000C@0017Lord Douglas,
about our conversation before...@0003
Can you at least assure me that your
nation has no reason to attack Nabata?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016You already have so much wealth...
Why is that so unreasonable?@0003
@0009...Attacks can be ordered
even without the king.@0003
@000CWhat does that mean...?@0003
@0009Etruria is a large nation governed by
various families of nobility.@0003
Not all nobles are kind at heart.@0003
If such nobles took over the court,
there is nothing the king or I could do.@0003
@000CBut what is there to gain
from a desert like Nabata?@0003
@0009It is not about gold for such people...
They simply enjoy showing their power.@0003
They feel no worth unless they are
stepping upon another.@0003
I understand that the people in the
Western Isles suffered such abuse.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
[0392]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@011B@0009@0017Igrene.@0003
@000CWhat is it,
Lord Douglas?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016I have already said this, but in my
position, I cannot promise what you ask.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016However, I will do my utmost to ensure
the likelihood of an attack is minimized.@0003
I shall spread word that a warrior of Nabata
was among the heroes who rescued the king.@0003
I will do all I can to persuade the nobles
never to disturb your peace in Arcadia.@0003
@000C...I shall remember
those words.@0003
I suppose I can ask
no more of you.@0003
@0009Forgive me.@0003
[0393]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@010A@0009@0017General Douglas!@0003
@000CPerceval.
We fight together once more.@0003
And yet I cannot erase the
shame I brought upon myself.@0003
@0009Please, General Douglas.@0003
It was your duty as
a general.@0003
You have nothing to
be ashamed of.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I am honored to be able to
fight by your side again.@0003
I'm sure the other Etrurians
with us feel the same way.@0003
@000CThank you...@0003
Your words are
encouraging.@0003
@0009Let us fight for the
future of Etruria!@0003
[0394]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@010A@000C@0017Perceval.
How do you fare?@0003
@0009I've been better.@0003
How about you,
General Douglas?@0003
@000CI am fighting my hardest, but...@0003
It seems I have lost the strength
I once had.@0003
I suppose no man can beat age.@0003
@0009Nonsense.@0003
You more than live up to
the title of Great General.@0003
You have quite some fight
in you yet.@0003
@000CI hope so.@0003
@0009Is something
troubling you?@0003
@000CNo, pay it no mind...@0003
[0395]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@010A@000C@0017Perceval.@0003
Perhaps it's a bit soon
to say so, but...@0003
@0009Yes?@0003
@000CI am considering stepping down as
Great General after this war.@0003
@0009What?!@0003
That would leave the highest position
in the Etrurian military empty!@0003
@000CI think not...
I want you to take my place.@0003
@0009I am still so young, General Douglas.
I cannot assume such a position...@0003
@000CYou think yourself young?
What of our commander, Roy?@0003
He is much younger than you,
yet he leads all of us.@0003
@0009Yes, but...@0003
@000CThe youth will have no room to grow
if the old hang onto their positions.@0003
Perceval, you are brilliant, strong
and a natural leader.@0003
Once the prince returns, the king
will abdicate the throne anyway.@0003
@0009General Douglas!@0003
Those in service are forbidden to speak
of the inheritance of the throne...@0003
@000CIt is no matter.@0003
I have served the king for decades.
I know him better than any.@0003
Once he learns of the prince's survival,
I am certain he will give him the throne.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016We must rebuild Etruria
alongside our new king.@0003
Etruria will be born again
under the care of the youth.@0003
I am counting on you,
Perceval.@0003
@0009...I won't disappoint you.@0003
[0396]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0134@000C@0017General Douglas!@0003
@0009Cecilia.@0003
@000CI knew you were alive, but I never
heard that you were here with us.@0003
Why didn't you tell me?@0003
@0009I fight in shame.@0003
@000CNonsense!
You are an asset to us all.@0003
It is an honor to fight
alongside you once again.@0003
Together we can show everyone why the
Etrurian Generals are so respected!@0003
@0009Hm...@0003
It's not like you to be
in such cheer, Cecilia.@0003
@000C@0017It's only because you're
here fighting with me.@0003
I've always idolized you, if
you want to know the truth.@0003
[0397]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0134@0009@0017The former Mage General appointed
you as his successor...@0003
But many were opposed to you
taking the position at first.@0003
@000CYes, that is true.@0003
A female officer was enough to
incite the rage of some.@0003
I spent most of my earlier days
fighting against prejudice.@0003
@0009To be honest, I doubted your
abilities at first, too.@0003
@000CYes, I know.@0003
Every time you told me I was
too weak for the job,@0003
I would bury myself in spell
tomes and work even harder.@0003
@0009That's just like you.@0003
I expect you must have
resented me quite a bit.@0003
@000COh?@0003
I never resented
you, General.@0003
Do you know why?@0003
@0009No. Please tell me.@0003
@000CThe day I enlisted, the other young officers
gave me a hard time for being a woman.@0003
But you defended me. You said that I
was stronger than any of them.@0003
@0009...I'm afraid I don't remember.@0003
@000CThat's all right.
I remember it perfectly.@0003
[0398]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0134@0009@0017Cecilia.@0003
@000CYes, General?@0003
@0009I must thank you.@0003
You've given an old,
decrepit soldier hope.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
What do you...?@0003
@0009I can feel my age whenever
I fight.@0003
An elderly soldier is of
no use. My time has come.@0003
It is up to you to lead
Etruria to a brighter tomorrow.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016I've never heard such foolish words
from your mouth, General.@0003
@0009......@0003
@000CA brighter tomorrow for Etruria?
The war has yet to be won.@0003
And even if we are victorious,
we still have much to do.@0003
We must rebuild our land and regain
the trust of other nations.@0003
Etruria's future comes after
everything has been settled.@0003
@0009Hmmm...@0003
@000CAnd you're going to place that
burden upon us as you retire?@0003
I won't allow it, General.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016...You really have grown
more confident.@0003
@000CIt is thanks to you.@0003
Now, why don't you find some use
instead of moping about your age?@0003
@0009Hm... Very well.@0003
You amateurs are no match for
me as long as I still stand.@0003
@000C@0017Hm hm hm...
That's better, General.@0003
[0399]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0126@0009@0017There you are, Larum.@0003
@000CFather!@0003
@0017Oh...@0003
@0017I mean, Lord Douglas!@0003
@0009@0017Don't worry. We don't need to keep our
relationship a secret from these people.@0003
We don't have many chances to speak
like this.@0003
Just call me Father, as you always do.@0003
@000CYes, Father...@0003
You don't look well.@0003
Are you OK?
Do you feel sick?@0003
@0009No, I'm not sick.
I'm just a little tired.@0003
@000CCan I help?@0003
If there's anything
at all, Father...@0003
@0009Larum...
It's all right.@0003
I feel better already
after seeing your face.@0003
You can go now...
There's no need for concern.@0003
@000CFather...@0003
[039A]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0126@000CFather!@0003
@0009@0017Larum?
What's the matter?@0003
@000C@0017I brought you my special protein
lunch to help keep up your energy!@0003
@0009Ah, thank you, Larum.@0003
@000CTee hee...
Go on! Eat up!@0003
@0009What, right here?@0003
A general shouldn't sit down for a
meal in the middle of a battle...@0003
@000C@0017Oh...
I'm sorry!@0003
O-of course... It's OK.@0003
I should have known better...
I'm...so stupid...@0003
@0009@0017...Well, I'll make an
exception for you.@0003
I don't want it to go
cold, after all.@0003
I changed my mind.
I'll eat it now.@0003@0002
...Mmm!@0003
This looks good.@0003
@000C@0017I-it's OK, Father!
Don't force yourself!@0003
@0009@0017No, truly, it's delicious!
Mmm... Yes.@0003
@000C@0017Father...@0003
@0009@0017I envy your future husband
and children.@0003
They'll get to eat your
delicious food every day.@0003
@000COh, Father!@0003
[039B]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0126@000CFather!
Father!@0003
@0009What is it, Larum?@0003
@000CI've finally found a way to
really cheer you up!@0003
@0009@0017Larum...@0003
It's the thought that counts.
Your consideration is enough.@0003
Don't worry your little head
over it.@0003
@000CI'm not worrying!@0003
It's just, if you look sad,
then I feel down, too.@0003
But if you laugh,
then I feel happy!@0003
@0009@0017Larum...
You're a wonderful daughter.@0003
I'm so proud of you.@0003
@000CAnd who made me who I am?
You, silly!@0003
You took me up off the street and
treated me like your own daughter.@0003
I...@0003
I've actually been happy with who
I am since you adopted me.@0003
@0009Larum...@0003
@000COh!@0003
Father, you're getting
all teary-eyed again!@0003
@0009Oh dear, you're right...
I must control my emotions.@0003
@000COK, let me cheer you up
with my latest dance!@0003
[039C]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@010B@000C@0017Sir Marcus!@0003
@0009Ah, Wolt.
What is the matter?@0003
@000CI have something
to ask of you.@0003
@0009You do?
What is it?@0003
@000CPlease, could you...teach me
how to use a sword?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
May I ask why?@0003
@000CI can only use bows.@0003
An archer can't even defend
himself at close range.@0003
I won't be able to protect
Lord Roy if something happens...@0003
@0009Do not belittle the bow.@0003
It has many traits that
close range weapons do not.@0003
@000CEven so...@0003
@0009Besides, what is the point in learning
swordplay at your late age?@0003
A mediocre skill would be nothing
but a hindrance to Lord Roy.@0003
@000CWell...@0003
@0009Do not worry yourself
about it any further.@0003
You are a great help to
Lord Roy as you are.@0003
@000C...I hope so...@0003
[039D]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@010B@000C@0017Sir Marcus.@0003
@0009Wolt...@0003
I can tell by your face that you still
want me to teach you swordplay.@0003
@000CI just don't understand.@0003
Am I really that much
help to Lord Roy?@0003
@0009Wolt...@0003
Tell me what you think of the knights
like me who served Lord Eliwood.@0003
@000CUh...well...@0003
You're all really strong
and I look up to you.@0003
@0009Well, thank you for that.@0003
But there was one problem with
Lord Eliwood's knights.@0003
@000CThere was?@0003
@0009None of us are even
close to him in age.@0003
@000CNow that you mention it...@0003
@0009Lord Eliwood's vassals...@0003
They were all old like me or too
young for him to relate to.@0003
He couldn't speak to us on a
comfortable level.@0003
In a way, he was isolated.@0003
@000CI never even thought
about that...@0003
@0009I don't want Lord Roy to suffer the
same fate.@0003
You and Lord Roy are the same age, and
what's more, you were raised together.@0003
I need you to stay by Lord Roy's
side and give him moral support.@0003
@000CMoral support?@0003
@0009Combat prowess is important, but
that is not all you can do.@0003
Think on what I've said. You are
more important than you realize.@0003
[039E]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@010B@0009@0017Ah, Wolt.
You look better.@0003
Do you still want me to teach
you how to wield a sword?@0003
@000CNo. After hearing your words, I
lost any sense of hesitation.@0003
I will perfect my skills with the bow
and ensure Lord Roy can count on me!@0003
@0009Very good.@0003
Then it appears I can let
you take over for me.@0003
@000CWhat? B-but if
you leave now...@0003
@0009No, no, I won't retire right at
this moment.@0003
Still, the day isn't far off.@0003
Once I am gone, you must take
care of Lord Roy.@0003
@000CMe...?@0003
@0009Are you embarrassed to take
over for an old man like me?@0003
@000CNo, not at all...@0003
It's just...do you really
think I can do it...?@0003
@0009There's your problem.
You lack confidence.@0003
Lord Roy won't be able to turn
to you if you're like that.@0003
@000CYou're right...@0003
@0009You can do it.
All you need is confidence!@0003

@0009Whew...
Ah, Wolt.@0003
@000C
You're sweating so profusely...
Are you all right?@0003
@0009Don't worry. I'm fine.@0003
I was just doing some practice
swings with my sword.@0003
I'm still weak. I must train
myself further.@0003
@000CBut...we're in the
middle of a battle.@0003
Shouldn't you be saving your energy
for an emergency, Sir Alen?@0003
@0009...Silence!
An enemy!@0003
Let's go, Wolt!
Don't lag behind!@0003@0011
@000CWha--?
Y-yes, Sir Alen!@0003
[03A0]
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@010B@0009@0017998!@0003
...999!@0003
...1000...!@0003
@000CSir Alen!@0003
@0009Ah...huff...Wolt...@0003
Good to...huff...see
you...huff...again...@0003
@000CM-must you train so hard
in battle?@0003
The enemy won't have much left
to fight if you're like that!@0003
@0009Maybe I'm crazy...but yes,
I have to do it.@0003
The continent feels bigger and
bigger the more we fight.@0003
@000CYes. Who knows what we
may be up against next?@0003
@0009We must break through our own
limits and become stronger.@0003
We must be able to stand against
any so we can protect Lord Roy.@0003
@000CYou're right!@0003
@0009All right...
I've caught my breath.@0003
Let's go!@0003@0011
@000CHe's amazing...@0003
But I can't let him
get ahead of me!@0003
[03A1]
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@010B@000C@001798...@0003
99...@0003
@0009Wolt?@0003
@000CSir Alen!@0003
@0009Are you training now, too?@0003
@000C
Yes, well, after seeing you, I couldn't
just sit around doing nothing.@0003
I have to become strong to protect
Lord Roy as well.@0003
@0009There you go.
That's the spirit!@0003
Become strong, and
surprise even Lord Roy!@0003
@000CYes!@0003
[03A2]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@010B@0009@0017@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Sir Lance?@0003
@0009...I get it now.@0003
@000CUh... Sir Lance?@0003
@0009Ah, Wolt.@0003
Sorry, I was thinking
some things over.@0003
@000CHave I disturbed you?@0003
@0009No, I understand now.
Everything is fine.@0003
@000CI...see.@0003
@0009Did you need something,
Wolt?@0003
@000CYes, I want to watch
you fight.@0003
Teach me to fight like you,
so I can protect Lord Roy!@0003
[03A3]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@010B@000C@0017Sir Lance?
What are you doing?@0003
@0009Ah, Wolt.@0003
I am keeping a record
of this battle.@0003
@000CA record?@0003
@0009Oh, yes. There is a quote from
one of my favorite books.@0003
"Information is the most
powerful weapon in any battle."@0003
And so, I keep track of our allies
and enemies and what goes on where.@0003
@000CI see.@0003
@0009In the battles ahead, one mistake
could lead to our doom.@0003
I must pay heed to every aspect
of battle for Lord Roy.@0003
@000CY-you're right!@0003
@0009...It's time.
I must be off.@0003@0011
@000CAmazing...
I should do like him!@0003
[03A4]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@010B@000C@0017Oh, Sir Lance.@0003
@0009Wolt...
Are you all right?@0003
Your eyes look
rather red...@0003
@000CYes! I'm fine.@0003
I was just reading the book
on tactics that you lent me.@0003
@0009That's good. Were you up
reading it all night?@0003
@000CActually, yes!@0003
@0009All right. You might be interested in
another I have by the same author.@0003
He describes his ideas in extreme
detail over 24 volumes.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016After studying it, you should
master the basics fairly easily.@0003
After that, we can go into more
advanced details...@0003@0002
Wolt?
Are you listening?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016Y...yes!
Of course!@0003
I'll do my best...@0003
[03A5]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@010C@000C@0017Oh!
There you are!@0003
@0009@0017Oh, hello, Dorothy.@0003
@000C@0017Where were you, Brother Saul?@0003
You always wander off
without saying anything...@0003
@0009It is not "wandering off",
Dorothy.@0003
I was diligently spreading word of our
church at the villages on the way here.@0003
@000C...Somehow I don't think you
were doing your job.@0003
@0009@0017Don't be ridiculous.@0003
I found a young maiden being
harassed by a very rude man.@0003
@000C@0017You mean yourself?@0003
@0009@0017Please, Dorothy, have some
faith in me.@0003
Anyway, I drove the man off
and rescued the maiden.@0003
I acted exactly as a holy
man ought to.@0003
@000C@0017Really? You're not exactly
very strong.@0003
How did you do it?@0003
@0009@0017I went to the man and clung
to him, crying,@0003
"I thought we loved each other!
Why do you reject me?!"@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016The man fled with great haste.@0003
The maiden, however, was also
gone by the time I looked back.@0003
[03A6]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@010C@000C@0017Brother Saul!
I can't believe you!@0003
@0009What is it, Dorothy?@0003
Can't I have a single moment
of peace and quiet?@0003
@000COh no, you're not brushing me
away this time.@0003
I heard what you've been
up to.@0003
You've been flirting with
every girl in this army.@0003
@0009@0017There is a misunderstanding.@0003
I was just trying to spread
the love of the gods...@0003
@000C@0017No, I'm not accepting
that again!@0003
@0009@0017What do you mean?@0003
@000C@0017I've heard that excuse before.
Think of something better!@0003
@0009@0017Hm...@0003
Very well. Wait a moment
while I think of a new one.@0003
@000C@0017What's the point of that?!@0003
@0009...Dorothy, why are you
so upset?@0003
This is nothing new.@0003
@000CThat's exactly the problem!@0003
People will misjudge the church
if they see you.@0003
@0009@0017I am insulted! I do my job
properly, Dorothy.@0003
Or haven't you noticed the sharp
increase in our female followers?@0003
@000C@0017Don't you understand? If you're
just flirting with everyone...@0003
@0009Understand what?@0003
@000CEnough of this!@0003
I'll chew you out tonight when
we go back to the chapel.@0003@0011
@0009...Sigh...@0003
[03A7]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@010C@0009Dorothy...@0003
@000C@0017What is it?@0003
I still haven't heard
a valid explanation.@0003
@0009Dorothy, I am sorry...@0003
I am sorry I...never
understood your feelings...@0003
@000C...Huh?@0003
@0009I understand perfectly now.@0003
You dislike my flirting because
I've always left you out of it.@0003
@000CWha...?!@0003
@0009Dorothy, I never knew that you
had such strong feelings for me...@0003
@000CAh, er, um...
Th-that was just...@0003
@0009But I am a servant of the gods...@0003
I must be equally caring to all women.
Please forgive me, Dorothy...@0003
@000CUh...
Um, er... I...@0003
@0009@0017How did that sound, Dorothy?@0003
@000C@0017...Wh-what?@0003
@0009@0017I pondered deeply, and that was the
best excuse I could come up with.@0003
@000C@0016@0017......@0003
@0016@0009V-violence is not a solution,
Dorothy.@0003
Our loving gods would not approve of
you pointing your bow at an ally...@0003
@000CI don't care!@0003
Get out of my sight before
I fill you with arrows!@0003
@0009Sigh...@0003
What are you so upset
about now?@0003
@000CYour blockheadedness!@0003@0009@0011@000C@0011
[03A8]
@0009@0010@011A@0005@000F@0017Look out!@0003
@0009@0016!@0003@0016
@000F@0010@010C@0080@000EI-I-I'm terribly sorry!@0003
I was aiming for an enemy,
but my arrow flew this way...@0003
Oh, what have I done?
Are you hurt?@0003
@0009I'm fine.
It didn't even touch me.@0003
@000CI-I...
I'm so sorry!@0003
@0009There's no need to apologize.@0003
Things like this often happen
on the battlefield.@0003
@000CBut...!@0003
@0009Even if I was hit by your arrow,
I would share the blame.@0003
After all, it's my responsibility
to be aware of my surroundings.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
@0009Never let your mind wander in battle.
That is a rule.@0003
Just don't be too upset about it.
All right?@0003
@000C...Yes, I understand.@0003
I'm probably just being a nuisance
by apologizing over and over.@0003
I'll try harder next time!@0003
[03A9]
@000C@0010@010C@0017Sigh...@0003
@000CThat last shot was just luck...@0003
I have to practice more.@0003
Perhaps I should aim@0005
more like this...@0003@0002
Oh!@0003
General Perceval!@0003
@0009@0010@011A
Training?
Very good.@0003
@000CY-yes, thank you!@0003
I sometimes make mistakes like before,@0003
so I thought I should train myself so
I'll be more than just a hindrance...@0003
@0009Good...@0003
Dorothy, I've been
thinking.@0003
You should relax more
when you shoot.@0003
@000CHuh...?@0003
You were watching
how I fight?!@0003
@0009I always try to watch and
understand how my comrades fight.@0003
I was waiting for a chance to
tell you,@0003
but I can see that you tend to
panic when you fight.@0003
@000CYes, that's true...@0003
I get scared in real battles, and
I can't move the way I want to...@0003
@0009...There is no need for archers to come
out front. Stay back and cover for us.@0003
You must tell yourself that there
is nothing to be afraid of.@0003
We will defend the front lines.@0003
@000C...Good thinking!@0003
[03AA]
@000C@0010@010C...Yes!@0003
Yes, that
was great!@0003
@0009@0010@011A@0017You seem to have improved,
Dorothy.@0003
@000C@0017General Perceval!@0003
I'm trying to relax when
I shoot, as you said.@0003
I think...I think I'm
getting better at it!@0003
@0009@0017I knew you had talent.@0003
It was just a matter of getting
your confidence together,@0003
and now that you have, you'll
keep improving more and more.@0003 
@000CI can relax when I think that the others
are defending the front lines...@0003
I'm surprised how safe I can feel on
the battlefield.@0003
@0009Ah, but that is the same for us up
front as well.@0003
We would not be able to charge in
without support from the back lines.@0003
@000C...Am I useful to you too,
General Perceval?@0003
@0009Yes, you're helping me out
a great deal.@0003
I look forward to your
support in future battles.@0003
@000CYou can count on me!@0003
[03AB]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010C@000C@0017Father Yoder?@0003
@0009Ah, Dorothy.@0003
You look unwell.
What is the matter?@0003
@000CDo you know why I can't
use healing staves?@0003
@0009Hm...@0003
@000CI want to help injured people by using
staves like you and Brother Saul.@0003
I've been praying every day, and I
think I've been faithful.@0003
@0009Yes, you have. Your faith is
an example to us all.@0003
@000CBut I still can't help the injured...
I want to heal them, but I can't.@0003
Will I never have that power?
Am I unworthy?@0003
@0009No, that's not it at all.@0003
Do you know the story of the
owl and the eagle, Dorothy?@0003
@000CNo, I don't.@0003
Please tell it to me,
Father Yoder.@0003
@0009It is a story of when Saint
Elimine still walked the Earth.@0003
One day, during Saint Elimine's
journeys,@0003
an owl approached her from
the forest.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009The owl said to her,@0003
"I wish to go to the land of gods.
Would you show me the way?"@0003
Saint Elimine thought for a
moment, and replied,@0003
"The gods' domain lies high
above the clouds.@0003
Your wings are not strong
enough to take you there."@0003
The owl, disappointed,
returned to the forest.@0003
@000CPoor owl...@0003
@0009Yes, indeed.@0003
We shall continue the
story some other time.@0003
@000CSome other time?
Why?@0003
@0009Remember the teachings of
Saint Elimine.@0003
Do not try to understand things
too quickly.@0003
You must ponder on what you are told
and develop your own thoughts.@0003
@000COh... Right.@0003
Then please continue the story
another time, Father Yoder.@0003
@0009Of course, Dorothy.
I promise you I will.@0003
[03AC]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010C@0009@0017...After parting with the owl, Saint
Elimine continued on her journey.@0003
The next day, an eagle swooped
down from the mountain.@0003
@000CUh-huh...@0003
@0009The eagle said to her,@0003
"I wish to go to the land of gods.
Would you show me the way?"@0003
Saint Elimine thought for
a moment, and replied,@0003
"The gods' domain lies in a
distant land beyond the night.@0003
Your eyes will not be able
to guide you through the dark."@0003
The eagle, disappointed,
returned to the mountain.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016However, the sympathetic and kind Saint
Elimine could not ignore the two birds.@0003
She went back, and brought the owl
and eagle together.@0003
She then told them,
"Journey to the land of gods together."@0003
@000CTogether...@0003
@0009Yes. The two birds traveled
to the gods' land together.@0003
The eagle used his powerful wings
to carry the owl,@0003
and the owl used his great eyes to
guide the eagle through the night.@0003
Together, they were able to reach
the gods' domain.@0003
That is the end of the story.
Do you understand it, Dorothy?@0003
@000CWell...@0003
Sort of.@0003
[03AD]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010C@000C@0017Father Yoder!@0003
@0009@0017Yes, Dorothy?@0003
@000C@0017About that story...@0003
@0009@0017Yes?@0003
@000C@0017I thought about it, but...
I'm not very smart...@0003
So I still don't get it...@0003
I sort of have an idea of what
it might be about, but...@0003
@0009@0017Then you have an answer, Dorothy.@0003
A story is just a story.
It has no definite meaning.@0003
Each person interprets a story and
comes up with their own answers.@0003
@000COh, good.@0003
I think I feel better now,
Father Yoder.@0003
@0009Do you?
Very good, Dorothy.@0003
@000CBut what did Saint Elimine
do after that?@0003
Are there more stories?@0003
@0009Yes, the journey of Saint Elimine
was a long one.@0003
The next day when Saint Elimine
continued on her travels...@0003
[03AE]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@010DGeneral Perceval!
It is good to see you again.@0003
@0009@0017Klein.
I am glad to see you well.@0003
It appears you've adjusted well
to the position of commander.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I think I have.@0003
Though I am one of the least
experienced in the army...@0003
@0009@0017From the way I see it, those
serving under you are lucky.@0003
@000CI hope so,
General Perceval.@0003
@0009...What do you think
of all this?@0003
@000C@0017Of what?@0003
@0009@0017What do you think
about this army?@0003
@000C@0017Frankly, I feel more at home
here than in the Etrurian army.@0003
Perhaps it is because of
General Roy...@0003
@0009@0017...I see.@0003
@000C@0017How do you feel,
General Perceval?@0003
@0009@0017
I don't feel completely
comfortable here.@0003
@000CYou don't?@0003
@0009I think what I seek from
an army doesn't exist here.@0003
@000CYou're saying you can't get
used to this army?@0003
@0009...No, not quite.@0003
It is simply that I am, and will
always be, a knight of Etruria.@0003
It is difficult for me to serve
any master but my homeland.@0003
[03AF]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@010D@0009@0017...How do you feel about the
revolution in Etruria?@0003
@000C...I understand Bern was pulling strings
behind the scenes, but still...@0003
I never could have imagined the court
would divide so violently.@0003
To tell the truth, it's still
difficult for me to accept.@0003
I...I never thought that greed ruled
the minds of so many people...@0003
@0009Etruria had not known war for
a very long time.@0003
Thus, blinded by peace, we paid no
heed to the scheming traitors.@0003
@000CYes... A conflict would have broken
out even without Bern's help.@0003
@0009Once this war is over, I will
devote my life to rebuilding Etruria.@0003
@000C@0017Of course, General Perceval.@0003
I am prepared to give my life for
that cause as well.@0003
@0009@0017Klein, I want you to
seek a different path.@0003
@000CWhat?!@0003
@0009Once I return to Etruria, I plan to
dismiss all but a few.@0003
The few I have absolute trust in
to stay loyal to the king and country.@0003
It is what must be done to maintain trust
among the king's vassals.@0003
@000CGeneral Perceval...
Don't be ridiculous!@0003
@0009Klein...@0003
@000C@0017...Please, think on it a
little more.@0003@0017
With your ability, you won't have
to go to such extreme measures.@0003
I've been holding this in because
we are at war, but I will no longer.@0003
I miss the days when I could look
up to you as an older brother.@0003
The days when we were more relaxed,
and when we laughed together...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000C@0017Once this war ends,@0003
let us celebrate the prosperity
of the new Kingdom of Etruria...@0003
Together, and in laughter.@0003
[03B0]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@010D@000CGeneral Perceval?@0003
@0009@0017Klein.@0003
Is something wrong?@0003
@000C@0017No, I just noticed you, so
I thought I should say hello...@0003
@0009@0017Yes, hello to you, too.@0003
@000C@0017But you know, I've been thinking...@0003
Before the revolution, we never
worked together like this.@0003
But look at us now.@0003
We fight together, not under the
Etrurian banner, but General Roy.@0003
@0009@0017Hm. Yes...
Fate works in strange ways.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, indeed.@0003
Oh, to change the subject...@0003
Do you still like the same
foods as before?@0003
@0009@0017Hm? ...Yes, I think so.
Why?@0003
@000C@0017It's just that the cook is a
little worried.@0003
He says that you are expressionless
no matter what you eat.@0003
He never knows what to give you.@0003
@0009@0017Expressionless?
...Do you agree with him?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, very much so,
General Perceval.@0003
Even when you drink wine,
your expression stays the same.@0003
If you stop expressing emotion,
you'll forget how to.@0003
@0009@0017That is not something
that can be forgotten.@0003
@000C@0017I'm not so sure when it comes
to you, General Perceval.@0003
@0009...Getting fresh, are we?@0003
@000CHa ha... It appears I need
not worry after all.@0003
[03B1]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@010D
@000CExcuse me.@0003
@0009@0017
Do you need something,
Commander Klein?@0003
@000CDieck... You don't
recognize me?@0003
@0009...How about that.
You do remember me.@0003
@000COf course! I recognized
you at once!@0003
You didn't seem to notice
me over there...@0003
@0009@001713 years...@0003
Young Master Klein is all
grown up, I see.@0003
@000CYou can stop calling
me Young Master.@0003
I'm 19 now.@0003
I serve as a commander
under the king himself.@0003
@0009Yeah, I know.
Not bad at all.@0003
How are Lord Pent
and Lady Louise?@0003
@000C
Oh, just as laid-back as always.@0003
This calamity doesn't seem to
concern them at all.@0003
I envy them sometimes.@0003
@0009Well...there's plenty to
envy about you, too.@0003
@000CWhat? What do
you mean?@0003
@0009We'll talk another time.@0003@0011
@000C@0017Dieck!@0003
I wanted to talk more...@0003
[03B2]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@010D@0009@0017Klein! Don't come out
front so much.@0003
@000C@0017This is a good vantage point.@0003
@0009@0017You bowmen should stay in back
and cover for us.@0003
There's no need for you to come
all the way up here.@0003
@000CDieck, I told you, I'm not a
child anymore.@0003
I often find myself up front
in the squad I lead.@0003
@0009Sorry, but you're still
Young Master Klein to me.@0003
I couldn't face Lord Pent
if you got hurt.@0003
@000C...If you care so much, why don't
you come back to the manse?@0003
@0017Dieck, once this war ends, come
back home with me.@0003
I'm certain Father and Mother
would love to see you.@0003
@0009I appreciate the thought, Klein.@0003
@0017But if you really care about
your family,@0003
you shouldn't talk to a mercenary
like me. It won't look good.@0003
@000CWhat...?!@0003
@0009You can only talk to me like this
now because this is war.@0003
Think about it.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
[03B3]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@010D@000C@0017Dieck.@0003
@0009...Klein, you really shouldn't
be talking to me right now.@0003
@000C...I wanted to tell you a story.
I want you to listen.@0003
It was 15 years ago, at Aquileia's
greatest arena.@0003
A noble's child was attacked by a
lion in the opening display.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016A young arena combatant was the one
who saved the child.@0003
He was a skilled swordfighter who could
defeat men twice his size with ease.@0003
But fighting a lion isn't the same.
He didn't leave the fight unscathed.@0003
He left with wounds all over his body
and four deep scars on his face.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016The noble, impressed and moved by
the swordsman's selfless act,@0003
hired him into his family's service
and treated him well.@0003
For several years, the young man served
as the family's personal arena fighter.@0003
His name became known all across
the land.@0003
But one day, he decided to give up
that life and left.@0003
The child, who looked up to the
fighter as if he were a brother,@0003
felt betrayed, and was devastated.@0003
...But now I understand.@0003
You were doing what you felt was best
for me and my family...@0003
@0009You...you were much too kind to me.
I was but a lowly fighter.@0003
Lord Pent and Lady Louise treated
me like family. Like a son.@0003
Gossip and accusations spread
about them.@0003
...That's why I left.@0003
@000CI understand that now.
But you should have stayed.@0003
@0009I'm sorry?@0003
@000CYou always wanted what was best
for us...@0003
But did you ever consider how much
we cared about you?@0003
I can't just forget about you...@0003
@0009@0017...You're right. I never
considered that. I'm sorry.@0003
@000CThen you'll come with me
back to my family?@0003
@0009Yeah, you win, Young Master Klein.@0003
I'll poke my head in at the manse
when I can.@0003
[03B4]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@010D@0009@0017That was a rough battle, milord.@0003
Would you care to rest your
tired heart?@0003
@000COh, you're...@0003
You're the bard that's always
with General Roy.@0003
@0009Yes, my name
is Elffin.@0003
@000C...Elffin, you look just like...
No... That's impossible.@0003
@0017Forgive me.
Never you mind.@0003
@0009...I look just like
someone you know...@0003
Is that it?@0003
@000CYes, but...it can't be.@0003
@0009@0017I stand before you, telling you myself,
yet you still do not believe me.@0003
Do my own vassals lack trust
in me, Klein?@0003
@000C@0017Prince Myrddin!
It is you!@0003
Oh...!@0003
It's such a joy to see you
alive and well, Your Highness!@0003
@0009You seem to have grown
while I was gone.@0003
@000C@0017Etruria has changed much in the year
of your absence, Your Highness.@0003
@0009Yes, I know. I am sorry I put
you through such trouble.@0003
@000CI was stationed in the Western Isles
so I wasn't affected too much.@0003
@0017...Amazing. You truly live...@0003
The Etrurian people will welcome
your return with jubilation!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
[03B5]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@010D@000CPr--
I mean, Lord Elffin!@0003
There you are.@0003
@0009@0017...Commander Klein,
can you spare a moment?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, what is it?@0003
@0009@0017...Lord.@0003
@000C@0017Lord?
What do you mean?@0003
@0009@0017...You don't understand?@0003
@000C@0017@0016......@0003@0016
Have I...done something wrong?@0003
@0009@0017...Someone is coming.@0003
We shall continue this
another day.@0003
@000C@0016...?@0003@0016
[03B6]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@010D@0009@0017...We have some
privacy here.@0003
@000CPr--
Lord Elffin,@0003
you wished to speak with me?@0003
Is it about Etruria?@0003
@0009No. It is about
what I said before.@0003
@000COh...@0003
When you said "Lord"?
I still don't understand.@0003
@0009Don't you think it strange for an Etrurian
noble to call a simple bard "Lord"?@0003
@000COh...!
Yes, you're right!@0003
Forgive me.@0003
I shall call you Sir
Elffin instead...@0003
@0009Just Elffin will do.@0003
@000CNo, that will not do!@0003
Even if you are in disguise, I cannot
address my prince simply by name.@0003
@0009@0017Hm...
...You haven't changed at all.@0003
@000C@0017Huh?@0003
@0009@0017Do you remember how you used to come
to the palace with your father?@0003
@000C@0017Yes...
I spent much time there.@0003
@0009@0017I had no siblings, so I found you
so precious as a toddler.@0003
I was still young and foolish,
so I told your father,@0003
"Your son shall be my brother.
He is to live in the palace."@0003
@000C@0017You, the prince,
said that?@0003
@0009@0017Yes, I know now that it
was ridiculous.@0003
Naturally, your father
struggled to respond.@0003
And then you spoke up.@0003
@000C@0017I did...?@0003
@0009@0017Yes. You said those same words.
"No, that will not do."@0003
@000C@0017...I don't remember.@0003
@0009@0017"I will be your knight, so
that will not do."@0003
Those were your exact words.@0003
You also told me to find
someone else to be my brother.@0003
@000C@0017...H-how impudent I was... I, uh...
Forgive me, Your Highness...@0003
@0009@0017Don't be absurd. I'm glad
that you haven't changed.@0003@0002
@0017...After I came back from the
brink of death,@0003
the world seemed so
different.@0003
It's relieving to see that some
things are still the same.@0003
@000CPrince Myrddin...@0003
[03B7]
@0009@0010@010D@000C@0010@0128@0009@0017Thea.@0003
@000C@0017Commander Klein!
Is something wrong?@0003
@0009@0017No, I'm fine. I just wanted
to tell you something.@0003
@000C@0017Tell me something?@0003
@0009@0017Yes. When I hired you
and your squad...@0003
I was an Etrurian
commander.@0003
@000CYes, of course.@0003
@0009Now that I'm no longer
an Etrurian commander,@0003
you are free to do as
you wish.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I know.@0003
@0009@0017Well, you don't seem to be taking
advantage of that freedom.@0003
@000CNo, I believe I am.@0003
@0009...If you say so.@0003
@000C...Are you trying to
say something?@0003
@0009No, it's nothing.
Don't concern yourself.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
[03B8]
@0009@0010@010D@000C@0010@0128@000C@0017Commander Klein.@0003
@0009Thea?
What's wrong?@0003
@000CIt's about what you
said before...@0003
@0009Before?@0003
@000CYou said that I don't seem to be
taking advantage of my freedom...@0003
@0009Oh, that.@0003
@000CI'm not quite sure what you
meant, so I wanted to ask you.@0003
@0009@0017Well, you're free to do what you want.
You have no obligation to stay here.@0003
That's all.@0003
@000C@0016!!@0003@0016
@0017...Does that mean that you
don't want me anymore?@0003
@0009@0017No, not at all.@0003
Thea, you're a mercenary.@0003
Staying with this army isn't
making you much money.@0003
If you only fight alongside
us out of responsibility,@0003
there's no need for you to
stay here.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I know.@0003
This army doesn't pay
very well.@0003
But I'm here by my
own choice.@0003
Please don't worry
about it.@0003
@0009Oh, all right, then.
I'm sorry to be a bother.@0003
@000CDon't be.@0003
[03B9]
@0009@0010@010D@000C@0010@0128@0009
Thea, when the war ends, I'll help
you find an army that pays well.@0003
@000C@0017...Why?@0003
@0009@0017I know you said that you're in
this army by choice,@0003
but I still feel responsible.@0003
You deserve further
compensation...@0003
@000C@0017...I can do that on my own.@0003
I appreciate the consideration,
but don't worry about it.@0003
@0009@0017But...@0003
@000C@0017Or is my presence here
a hindrance to you?@0003
@0009N-no!
Not at all!@0003
@000CThen why are you talking
to me like that?!@0003
@0009...What's the matter, Thea?
Why are you so upset...?@0003
@000CAll you've talked about lately is
getting me out of this army...@0003
And away from you!@0003
@0009What?
No, I...@0003
@000CI choose to stay by your
side because I love you!@0003
But you...you never
even realized it!@0003
@0009Erm, well... I'm sorry.@0003
I...never noticed your
feelings towards me...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016But, err...@0003
You know, Thea, it's really
your fault I haven't noticed!@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009You keep calling me
"Commander" Klein.@0003
As if you want to keep your
distance!@0003
That's why I thought you were
only here out of responsibility.@0003
@000CB-but...@0003
@0009@0017Don't call me "Commander" anymore.
Just Klein, OK?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, Commander Klein.@0003
@0009@0017Wrong.
Klein.@0003
@000C@0017Huh?@0003
@0017Oh... Yes...
Klein.@0003
[03BA]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010E@0009Saul...@0003
@000CFather Yoder...@0003
Do you need something
from me?@0003
@0009No...but I thought
we might talk a bit.@0003
Are you performing your
duties as you should?@0003
@000COf course, Father Yoder.@0003
We get more followers every
day thanks to my work.@0003
Please take a look at
this list...@0003
@0009...Hm.@0003
There seem to be an overwhelmingly large
number of female names on this list.@0003
@000CWell... You know.@0003
@0009Do I?@0003
@000CErr...@0003
Women must understand my sermons
better than gentlemen do.@0003
@0009Oh, I see.
Very good.@0003
@000CYes, thank you.@0003
@0009Just remember, Saul, that your
duty is that of a missionary.@0003
Not a philanderer.@0003@0011
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016I can't beat him,
can I...?@0003
[03BB]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010E@0009Saul, how is your mission
coming along?@0003
@000CAh, yes. As I notified you
in my letter,@0003
Lord Roy is in possession
of the Fire Emblem now.@0003
@0009Has there been anything
else worth noting?@0003
@000CNo, not particularly.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
I am sorry to put you
through all this, Saul.@0003
@000CNo, please don't be.@0003
I did it all for our loving
Saint Elimine.@0003
@0009Yes, of course.
That warms my heart to hear.@0003
...Oh, Saul. I have received
a complaint from Sir Merlinus.@0003
Apparently you stalk Princess
Guinivere wherever she goes...@0003
@000CYes, Father Yoder.
That is my mission.@0003
@0009Saul, your mission is to keep
an eye on the Fire Emblem.@0003
And you already told me that it
is now in the hands of Lord Roy.@0003
Not Princess Guinivere.@0003
@000CYes, well, be that as it may,
consider this, Father Yoder.@0003
I can't follow Lord Roy wherever
he goes just because he has the Emblem.@0003
His appearance ill suits my tastes.
I cannot justify it.@0003
@0009@0017...Saul?@0003
[03BC]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@010E@0009Saul, perhaps it is time to
relieve you from your mission.@0003
@000CWhat do you mean,
Father Yoder?@0003
@0009I believe I know Lord Roy
well enough to trust him.@0003
The Fire Emblem is safe
in his hands.@0003
What we feared will surely
not come to pass.@0003
Do you agree?@0003
@000CYou are probably right.@0003
...However, I wish to continue
my mission a little longer.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
@000COf course, I understand your
reasoning, Father Yoder.@0003
Lord Roy is certainly a
trustworthy person.@0003
Still...Lord Roy is young, and needs
people to guide him through this vile world.@0003
Who better than one such as I, with so
much experience in such ugliness?@0003
@0009Saul...@0003
@000CEr... All that said, I too am pure, so
disregard my declaration if you wish.@0003
@0009Yes, I think I will.@0003
...Oh, Saul.@0003
I found this pamphlet
the other day...@0003
@000COh?
This is...@0003
@0009"All wounds treated freely for members
of the church. Sign up today!"@0003
This...treating the gods like some
sort of commercial service.@0003
I do not approve of this at all...
What will others think?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009...Saul, I believe you may benefit
from hearing a sermon of mine.@0003
@000COh, Father Yoder, I'm not worthy
to have the privilege of your...@0003
@0009@0017...Will you listen to
my sermon?@0003
@000C...Yes, of course,
Father Yoder...@0003
[03BD]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@010E@000COh, dear gods above...
To meet such a lovely woman...@0003
To be witness to this perfect
work of beauty...@0003
@0009@0017Oh, you're Saul,
right?@0003
Good day.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
Oh... Er, yes,
good day.@0003
@0009I'm sorry, I was thinking, so I
didn't hear what you said.@0003
Would you please repeat it
for me?@0003
@000C@0017...Erm...@0003
Sorry, I can't.@0003
Anyway, General Cecilia, seeing that
we are both servants of the gods,@0003
might you be interested in having
dinner with me some time?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, I'm sorry.@0003
I don't serve the gods
like you do.@0003
@000C@0017Of course you do, milady.
Everyone in the world serves the gods.@0003
@0009@0017Do you think so?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, absolutely. So should I make
arrangements for dinner?@0003
@0009@0017I suppose I'll think about it.@0003
[03BE]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@010E@000CAh, General Cecilia!@0003
@0009@0017Oh, Saul.@0003
@000C@0017To have the privilege
of meeting you again...@0003
Your beauty is so overwhelming.
It is an honor.@0003
@0009@0017Are you always like that?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, more or less.@0003
But my only goal is to make
you feel at ease around me...@0003@0002
Ah, yes!@0003
We must decide on a date for
our dinner meeting.@0003
Have you thought about it?@0003
@0009@0017Dinner?@0003
@000CTh-this cannot be!
You've forgotten?@0003
We agreed that we all serve the
gods in our own way, remember?@0003
@0009@0017Ah, yes... I think I can
recall vaguely...@0003
@000C@0017Vaguely?@0003
@0009I'm sorry.
I'm busy with the battle.@0003
@000COh... I see.@0003
@0017Then I suppose it shall
have to be another day.@0003
But please do not forget
this time.@0003
@0009@0017Yes, I'll try not to.@0003
[03BF]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@010E@000CAh!
General Cecilia!@0003
@0009Saul.@0003
@000CI trust that you have thought
about our dinner meeting?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, yes.@0003
@0017I will invite you to my
manor when the war ends.@0003
@000CI will look forward to that!@0003
It is not every day that one is invited
to the manor of an Etrurian noble.@0003
@0009@0017But you might want to bear in
mind that my father can be...@0003
a little difficult.@0003
@000CDifficult?
What do you mean?@0003
@0009Well, ordinarily my father is
a very kind and caring man.@0003
However, one time, when I
was still a child,@0003
I invited a male friend of
mine to the manor.@0003
When my father saw him, he drew
his sword and threatened his life.@0003
@000CUh...@0003
I would call that more
than "difficult".@0003
@0009My father lost his temper,
and we tried to calm him down.@0003
But he would have none of it.@0003
The tea spilled everywhere,
the table was sliced in two,@0003
and what was supposed to be a dinner
party was more like an arena battle.@0003
My friend somehow escaped with
his life.@0003
I will never forget that day.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009But my father isn't that bad
compared to my grandfather...@0003
@000C@0017Oh, I just remembered!@0003
I have some work at the church
that I must attend to.@0003
I'm terribly sorry,@0003
but I don't believe I will ever be
able to meet for dinner after all...@0003@0011
@0009Oh? I was looking
forward to it.@0003
[03C0]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@011B@0009Oh, dear gods...@0003
@000C@0017What?@0003
@0009@0017That I can meet such a
beautiful woman...@0003
I feel blessed this day.@0003
@000C@0017...Do you need something?@0003
@0009@0017Yes, as a matter of fact!
...Ah, before that...@0003
I am Saul. And you are,
my perfect flower?@0003
@000C@0017I am Igrene.
So...what do you need?@0003
@0009@0017Ah, such a beautiful name,
as I expected.@0003
@0009Igrene...@0003
If I were to describe the pleasure
of hearing such an elegant name--@0003
@000C@0017No, there is no need
for that.@0003
What is it that you need?@0003
@0009@0017Do you know of the St. Elimine
Church, Igrene?@0003
It is very popular among
the nobility,@0003
because when one prays deeply,
all of one's dreams come true!@0003
@000C@0017Oh... That's what
you want...@0003
I'm sorry, but I don't
believe in the gods...@0003
@0009@0017Oh, but you must.@0003
If you don't follow the teachings of
the church, you will be cursed!@0003
@000C@0017...The gods you follow
would do that?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, no, I was just kidding
around.@0003
How about we have dinner
together one evening?@0003
Then I can teach you all
about the gods' love...@0003@000C@0011
@0009Uh, Igrene?
Where are you going?@0003
[03C1]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@011B@0009Ah, Igrene!@0003
@000C@0017...You again.@0003
@0009@0017It is truly a miracle that
we could meet once more.@0003
Saint Elimine must have
guided you towards me.@0003
@000C@0017I don't think so.
I'll be going now...@0003
@0009Oh, please wait!@0003
It is a wonderful thing
to believe, Igrene!@0003
@000CI know. I believed in
gods once.@0003
Different from yours,
though.@0003
I was quite devout.@0003
@0009Really?@0003
Why did you stop believing?@0003
@000CSeveral years ago...
I stopped praying.@0003
It was after I lost a
loved one in battle.@0003
@0009...I see.@0003
@000CThose who pray to the gods expect
something in return.@0003
But when they receive nothing,
they cease to believe they exist.@0003
I think it's less trouble to
never believe in the first place.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016Yes...
You may be right.@0003
@000C...Should a priest like you
really be saying that?@0003
@0009@0017Yes, it's fine.
I am an open-minded person.@0003
@0017However, Saint Elimine
did say this:@0003
"When the gods don't help us,
it is because they believe in us."@0003
@000CThey...believe in us?@0003
@0009Yes, I think they do.@0003
[03C2]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@011B@000C@0017Brother Saul.@0003
@0009@0017Oh, Igrene!
What is the matter?@0003
Ah, you understand your feelings
at last, and decided to see me...@0003
@000C@0017It's about what you said
before...@0003
You said when the gods don't help
us it's because they believe in us.@0003
@0009@0017That is what Saint Elimine said.@0003
The gods who created this world are
all-powerful.@0003
They can change people and the world.@0003
They can make humans docile so that
we don't fight as we do now.@0003
But what would that achieve?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Humans manipulated by the gods are
nothing more than mindless puppets.@0003
The gods believe that humans can change,
that we can learn from our mistakes.@0003
The gods know that we can overcome
our hardships to achieve peace.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016@0017
I don't believe in the gods, but I
respect what you say, Brother Saul.@0003
I must be off now...@0003@0011
@0009@0017Please, it is my pleasure
to be of assistance.@0003
Now, shall we discuss our
dinner meeting?@0003
@0017...Igrene?
Where are you going?@0003
[03C3]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@010F@000CAre you Brother Saul?@0003
I am Elen, a cleric of the
St. Elimine Church in Bern.@0003
I am pleased to make your
acquaintance.@0003
@0009Dear gods, I thank you
for your blessing...@0003
@000CUm... Brother Saul?@0003
@0009Truly, being able to meet such a beautiful
lady is a blessing from the gods!@0003
And you are a follower of the
St. Elimine Church, no less!@0003
This meeting must have been part of
some divine plan.@0003
Please, let us meet this evening so that
we can discuss the love of the gods.@0003
@000CYes, I would love to.
What time can you meet?@0003
I am free all night...@0003
@0009@0017@0016......@0003@0016
Are you serious?@0003
@000C@0017I am always serious
about the gods.@0003
Why would I refuse?@0003
@0009@0017
...If you accept so easily,
there's no...satisfaction.@0003
@000CSatisfaction?@0003
@0009@0017Oh!@0003
@0017Please, never you mind.
But Elen, are you sure?@0003
With a woman like you, I may lose
control, and...do things.@0003
@000C@0017I'm not worried.
You are a priest.@0003
I'm sure you would
never do such a thing.@0003
@0009...Er...
I'm sorry.@0003
Perhaps some
other day.@0003
@000COh... I was looking
forward to it...@0003
[03C4]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@010F@0009Why, hello, Elen.@0003
@000CGood day, Brother Saul.
It is good to see you well.@0003
@0009@0017...You are so tense, so stressed!
You must relax your muscles.@0003
@000C...Do you think so?@0003
@0009@0017Absolutely. Those in service to the gods
must learn to unwind once in a while.@0003
You should enjoy the finer things in
life at times, as I do.@0003
@000CYes...but...@0003
@0009I once knew a lady like you...@0003
Well, not "knew" so much as
"was slapped by", but...@0003
If you serve the gods, you must
experience all of their creation.@0003
You can experience things that will
open your eyes...@0003
Things that you will not believe.@0003
@000COh my, yes...@0003
@0009Life is all about the
experiences we can have.@0003
Shall we discuss meeting
this evening again?@0003
I am free at any time.@0003
@000CThat would be marvelous.
I would love to hear you.@0003
@0009Excellent. Then...@0003
@000CI shall invite the
others as well.@0003
@0009...Excuse me?
The others?@0003
@000COh, yes. If you will preach, then let
us help as many as we can.@0003
I'll ask Lord Roy, Merlinus, and any
others who are interested.@0003
I'm sure some of them will be
free tonight.@0003@0011
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
Dear me...
What to do...@0003
[03C5]
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@010F@000C@0017Brother Saul... Why didn't
you come that night?@0003
Everyone was so looking
forward to your sermon...@0003
@0009@0017Oh, er... My throat
was unwell that day.@0003
We can try again some
other time...@0003
@000CYes, let's.@0003@0002
Brother Saul, you are
so selfless.@0003
@0009@0017...Selfless?
Me?@0003
@000C@0017Oh, yes. You appear to be an
impious womanizer.@0003
Hardly someone I would call
a priest.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016But I finally realized that there is
a reason for that.@0003
It is a character act.@0003
It is to show that the St. Elimine
Church accepts even the lowest of men.@0003
@0009@0017Ah...@0003
I, uh... Hmm. OK.@0003
@000C@0017Acting as you do ruins your
reputation and image...@0003
Everyone thinks you're lazy and
only interested in women...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016But the truth is that you do it for
the church.@0003
I could not sacrifice myself as you do.
You have my respect, Brother Saul.@0003
@0009@0017Er... Thanks. I think.@0003
Well, anyway, just remember to
relax once in a while.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, Brother Saul.@0003
[03C6]
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@010F@000CMadam Melady,
are you unhurt?@0003
@0009Yes, Elen, I'm fine.@0003
@000COh, if you're going up front,
please take these vulneraries...@0003
@0009Elen, what's the matter?@0003
@000C@0017I'm sorry?@0003
@0009@0017You seem to be more...
concerned than usual.@0003
@000C@0017I-I don't think so.@0003
@0009If you have something to say,
then I will listen.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016@0017Well, I can't force you...@0003
But as we both serve
Princess Guinivere,@0003
I would appreciate if
you voiced any concerns.@0003
@000C@0017I-I'm sorry...@0003
@0009Ah, well, I suppose I can
wait until you're ready.@0003@0011
@000CI'm sorry...
Madam Melady...@0003
[03C7]
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@010F@000C@0017Madam Melady!
About before...@0003
@0009Before?@0003
@000CYou said that I
seemed concerned...@0003
@0009Oh, that.@0003@0017
Are you ready to tell me
what's on your mind?@0003
@000C@0017Yes. Uh...@0003
It's just that...
I wanted to apologize.@0003
@0009@0017Apologize?
For what?@0003
@000C@0017When the princess and I left to
meet with the Lycian lords,@0003
I didn't consult you at all.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I wanted to apologize for that...@0003
I know you have nothing but loyalty
for Princess Guinivere, yet I...@0003
@0009@0017You just followed Princess Guinivere's
orders, as is your duty.@0003
You have nothing to apologize for.@0003
@000C@0017But...@0003
@0009@0017Elen, you always doubt your
actions too much.@0003
You won't be able to move forward
if your mind is stuck in the past.@0003
@000CYes, you're right...@0003
[03C8]
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@010F@0009Elen, you look
a lot better now.@0003
@000CYes, I feel a weight has been
lifted off my shoulders.@0003
Thank you again for listening
to me.@0003
@0009Any time at all.@0003
@000C@0017But...our roles are reversed...@0003
I am the cleric.@0003
It is I who am supposed to listen to
others to relieve them of their problems,@0003
and yet it is you who helped me.@0003
@0009Elen, I told you not to 
doubt your actions.@0003
@000CI know...@0003
@0009I'm actually grateful you didn't tell
me when you left with the princess.@0003
@000CGrateful...?
You are?@0003
@0009@0017Of course.@0003
You kept Princess Guinivere
safe even without me.@0003
@000C@0017Madam Melady...@0003
@0009@0017Together I'm sure we can be of
great help to Princess Guinivere.@0003
Just don't worry so much about
trivial matters anymore, all right?@0003
@000CYes, you're right.@0003
[03C9]
@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@012A@000C@0017Elen!@0003
@0009Sir Zeiss?!@0003
@000C@0017I thought that was you.
You are with this army as well.@0003
@0009Yes, I will always be at
Princess Guinivere's side...@0003
Did you join to help
Madam Melady?@0003
@000CThat's part of it, of course,@0003
but the main reason is to see
how the princess helps Bern.@0003
@0009So you will be assisting
us as well?@0003
@000C@0017Well, not exactly...@0003
@0017Actually, yeah, I guess
I will be.@0003
@0009Thank you. You will be of
great assistance.@0003
@000CYeah. Well, maybe.@0003
@0009I'll see you then.@0003
@000CYeah, see you later.@0003
[03CA]
@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@012A@0009@0017Sir Zeiss!@0003
@000CElen, what's the matter?@0003
@0009I saw a man over there with a
terribly menacing look on his face...@0003
@000CWhat?! Where?!@0003
Oh, him?@0003
@0017...Elen, he's in
our army.@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
Oh dear...
How very embarrassing...@0003
@000C@0017Did you scream or something?@0003
@0009Yes, I'm afraid so.@0003
@000CYou're still scared of men?@0003
I remember it was years before you
would speak to me normally like this.@0003
@0009@0017I'm sorry...@0003
@000C@0017No, it's all right.
That's just how you are.@0003
But you don't need to
address me as "Sir".@0003
@0009@0017Ah...I...@0003
@000C@0017OK, OK, don't lose your
head about it...@0003
Well, I'll see you around.
Let me know if anything happens.@0003@0011
@0009@0016......@0003
[03CB]
@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@012A@000CElen!@0003
@0009@0017Z...
Sir Zeiss.@0003
@000C@0017Here.@0003
@0009@0017These flowers...!@0003
@000C@0017They're the same as the ones you
grew back in Bern, aren't they?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Elen?
What's wrong?@0003
Wait, are these the
wrong flowers?@0003
@0009...Why...?@0003
@000C@0017Huh?@0003
@0009Why are you always...
so kind to me...?@0003
@000C@0017Eh? Ah, er, well...@0003
We come from the same town,
and, uh... I don't know.@0003
I feel that I can't...
leave you alone, you know?@0003@0017
I want to stay by your side
and@0004 protect you...@0003
Do you not want me to?@0003
@0009@0017No, I'm very glad...@0003
@0017But I must stay by
Princess Guinivere...@0003
@000CI know.@0003
I'm a knight of Bern, so I'll
protect the princess, too.@0003@0017
I'll protect you both, so we
can someday return to Bern!@0003
@0009Thank you, Zeiss...
Thank you.@0003
[03CC]
@000C@0010@010F@0009@0010@0121@0009Sister!@0003
I got the medicine and cloth
you asked for from Merlinus.@0003
@000CThank you. Could you leave
them there, please?@0003
@0009Here?@0003
If you'll excuse me,
I have to get going.@0003
@000CWait!@0003
@0009Yes?@0003
@000CAre you an assistant
to the transporter?@0003
@0009No, I fight as well.@0003
@000C@0017What?@0003
A child like you...
in battle?@0003
@0009@0017I may be a kid, but I'm
pretty handy with my magic!@0003
@000C@0017No, I don't doubt your ability...@0003
It's just...children shouldn't
be on the battlefield.@0003
@0009@0017I'm only about two years
younger than Lord Roy, though.@0003
@000C@0017Lord Roy...has no choice
but to be here.@0003
That is not the case
for you.@0003
@0009@0017No, I have no choice, either.
I must fight.@0003
@000C@0017But...!@0003
@0009@0017Thanks for the concern,
but I'm fine.@0003
Actually, there's someplace
I need to be right now.@0003
See you later, Sister!@0003@0011
@000C@0017@0016......@0003@0016
[03CD]
@000C@0010@010F@0009@0010@0121@000C@0017Do you have a moment?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, you're the cleric
from before!@0003
@000C@0017My name is Elen.@0003
@0009@0017And I am Lugh.@0003
@000C@0017You really do fight
on the battlefield...@0003
Are you all right?
You're not injured?@0003
@0009@0017I'm fine.@0003
I may be small,
but I'm pretty fast.@0003
@000C@0017Lugh...@0003
I'm still uneasy about allowing such
a small child into battle...@0003
@0009Do I look so small?@0003
But if that's how you want to
play it,@0003
then isn't it just as dangerous to
send a frail lady like you into battle?@0003
@000CThat...may be true, but...@0003
@0009@0017Yep!@0003
So if you're ever in danger,
I'll come to your rescue.@0003
You can count on me!@0003
@000CAll right, Lugh.@0003
@0017Please don't do
anything rash.@0003
[03CE]
@000C@0010@010F@000E@0010@0121@0080@000B@0017Sister Elen!@0003
@000C@0017Lugh?
What's wrong?@0003
@0009@0017I-I thought I saw an
enemy near you...@0003
Huff, huff...@0003@0006
@0017But I guess I was wrong.
Thank goodness.@0003
@000CYou were looking out for me?
Thank you.@0003
@0009Of course!
I said I would protect you.@0003
@000CYou have such a kind heart...@0003
I am sure the gods look
favorably upon you.@0003
@0009...That smile makes you look
like a goddess!@0003
@000C@0017A goddess?
Me?@0003
@0009@0017Actually, I was worried about you
because you always looked so pensive.@0003
Not that I can really blame you
given the war and all...@0003
But I feel so much better when
you smile like that!@0003
@000CI feel better when I see
your smile too, Lugh.@0003
[03CF]
@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@010F
@0009@0017Sister! Wait!
Wait, please!@0003
@000CSorry, do you mean me?@0003
@0009Yeah. Sorry I yelled...@0003
But I need to ask
you something.@0003
@000CI will help
you if I can.@0003
@0009OK, well, unless I'm wrong, one of
these herbs is medicinal, right?@0003
Vulneraries are made from one of
these, aren't they?@0003
@000CYes, this one has medicinal
properties.@0003
I'm surprised you knew that.@0003
@0009Poppa taught us at the
orphanage I used to live in.@0003
@000CHe sounds like a good man.@0003
@0009Yeah, he sure was!@0003
Well, I need to hurry
with this herb.@0003
@000CDo you?
Is someone hurt?@0003
@0009Yeah, a traveler was hit
by a stray arrow.@0003
It's not a large wound, but
the bleeding won't stop.@0003
@000CMy healing staff will be more
effective than the herb.@0003
Can you show me to this
traveler?@0003
@0009Really?!
You'll help him out?!@0003
@000COf course.@0003
@0009Let's hurry!
This way!@0003
[03D0]
@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@010F
@0009@0017Sister Elen!@0003
@000CHello, Chad.@0003
@0009Thanks for your help
before.@0003
The traveler made
a full recovery.@0003
He wanted me to
thank you.@0003
@000CI only did what
anyone would have.@0003
@0009No way! I've never met anyone willing to
use a pricy healing staff on a commoner.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009Only those with the St. Elimine
Church treat commoners with staves.@0003
And even then, it's only when the
wound is lethal or something.@0003
@000C...Really?@0003
@0009Yeah, at least that's how it is in the
Lycian countryside where I grew up.@0003
But that's why we learned how to use
herbs and things.@0003
...At least until Bern invaded.@0003
@000C...I...see.@0003
@0009Whoa! S-sorry, I didn't mean to
make you feel down or anything...@0003
@000CIt's not your fault...
I just can't believe...@0003
I can't believe my...home country
would start this war...@0003
@0009...Sister Elen, are you...?@0003
@000CYes. I...come from Bern.@0003
@0009@0016!!@0003
......@0003@0011@0016
@000CChad! Wait!@0003
...Chad.@0003
[03D1]
@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@010F
@000C@0017...Chad.@0003
@0009@0016!@0003@0016
@000CWait! Don't go!@0003
Please...
Listen to me.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000CMy country started this war.@0003
So I understand...if you resent
a person of Bern like me...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000CBut why?@0003
I see no hatred in your eyes.
Only sorrow.@0003
@0009@0016!@0003@0016
@000CWould you...tell me about it?@0003
I think it may release some of
the burden on your shoulders...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
...Poppa...the father of our orphanage...
He was killed by Bern's soldiers...@0003
We had a little garden where
we grew food.@0003
The soldiers... They trampled it with
their horses because...@0003
because they said it was in the way.@0003
It was a tiny garden with nothing
but roots, and yet they still...@0003
@000CThen...Poppa was killed
protecting the garden?@0003
@0009Yeah... It may have been just a bunch
of roots...but it was our food.@0003
@000CChad, you can cry...
If you feel sad, let it out.@0003
@0009...I was the oldest of the orphans,
so I can't cry.@0003
The little kids and my best
friend Lugh...@0003
They went into shock seeing
Poppa killed before their eyes.@0003
It was my job to take care
of them.@0003
I don't want to lose any more
family... That's why I fight.@0003
@000CYou're strong.@0003
@0009My hatred for Bern fuels my
strength...@0003
The drive to avenge Poppa and
protect all the orphans...@0003
That was my purpose in life.
It felt just!@0003
@000CDo you hesitate now?@0003
@0009...I hated everyone from Bern.@0003
I thought they only cared
about themselves.@0003
...Until I met you.@0003
@000CChad... I'm on your side.@0003
Regardless of my home...I want
to help you.@0003
Do you hate me...?@0003
@0009...I don't know.@0003
@000CThen I'll stay at your
side, Chad.@0003
I can't replace Poppa...@0003
But the least I can do is be
there for you.@0003
@0009...Have it your way!@0003
@000CThank you, Chad.@0003
[03D2]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0110
@0009Well, well... You.@0003
@000CYes, hello.
You seem to be doing well.@0003
@0009Heh... You've become an old man
since the last time I saw you.@0003
@000COh, yes, it's so embarrassing.
But you're as youthful as ever I see.@0003
@0009...Is that sarcasm?@0003
@000CNot at all.@0003
...It truly has been a long time.
How many years ago was it?@0003
@0009Forty...no, fifty years?
A long time...@0003
@000CYes... Indeed.@0003
@0009...I think I finally understand
how you felt back then.@0003
@000CYes, and I, you.@0003
@0009But that was a long time ago...
A time that will never return.@0003
Our paths split that day.
They'll never cross again.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
[03D3]
@000C@0010@0110@0017
@0009...Yoder... Yoder!
Are you listening?@0003
@000CNiime...@0003
@0009...They killed your sister. She cried
your name out as she died.@0003
And still...you refuse to
do a thing.@0003
@000CI...@0003
@0009You're telling me to forgive them?
Hah, what will that accomplish?@0003
If we let them live, they're sure
to repeat their actions.@0003
More innocent people will die by
their hands.@0003
Is that what you want?
Answer me, Yoder!@0003
@000CNiime, I...@0003@0011@0006
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0110
@0009Yoder?@0003
@000C...Niime.@0003
@0009What were you doing?
I almost thought you'd up and died.@0003
@000CNo, I was reminiscing about
the past.@0003
If I just close my eyes, I can see
it as if it were happening now...@0003
@0009Heh...
Finally going senile, are we?@0003
@000CFoul words still pour from your
mouth as they always did...@0003
[03D4]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0110@0017
@000CThe end of this war...
draws near.@0003
@0009So it seems.@0003
@000CWhat will you do
after it ends?@0003
@0009Who knows? I already told you our
paths will never cross again.@0003
We'll go our separate ways,
as we did before.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
Niime, you and I have changed.@0003
Our paths may just cross
again one day.@0003
I will pray for it.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
...Well, no one can know the future.@0003
A path that splits at one point...
may join again further down the road...@0003
Who can say...?@0003
[03D5]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@012E@0009Hm...
So this is a wyvern.@0003
@000C@0017You are...Father Yoder of
the St. Elimine Church.@0003
@0009@0017Yes, it's a pleasure to finally
meet you, Madam Melady.@0003
She is so passive...@0003
I imagined wyverns to be more
ferocious creatures.@0003
@000C@0017Tryffin will spread her wings and
bare her fangs at my command.@0003
However, that is only because of
her training by the Bern Army.@0003
...Perhaps she wishes not to
fight at all.@0003
@0009Perhaps not...@0003
@000CTryffin and I have trained together
ever since we were both young.@0003
We trained hard to be proud warriors
in service to our country.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I...@0003
I don't regret leaving Bern
with Princess Guinivere.@0003
But Bern is still my home...@0003
It is painful to fight against
my former allies.@0003
@0009...I can only imagine.@0003
@000C@0017But I must get used to it.@0003
For Princess Guinivere...
and for my country.@0003
[03D6]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@012E@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Is something wrong,
Madam Melady?@0003
@000C@0017No... It's just that my
home is in this area.@0003
@0009@0017Ah... Do you have
family here?@0003
@000C@0017My grandfather and my parents.@0003
My father and his father used to tell
stories of battles they fought in.@0003
How elated they were when my brother
and I were knighted as well...@0003
I wonder what they're doing now...@0003
@0009...Madam Melady...@0003
Your path has been a
difficult one indeed.@0003
Forgive me. I have
little to offer you.@0003
@000C@0017Don't be...@0003
Simply your ear is more helpful
than you may realize...@0003
I needed someone like you to
listen to me.@0003
@0009I will be more than happy to listen
to anything you have to say.@0003
Don't forget, Madam Melady...
You are not alone.@0003
@000CThank you,
Father Yoder...@0003
[03D7]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@012E@000CFather Yoder, I must thank you
for helping me.@0003
I no longer feel alienated in
this army...@0003
@0009Of course...
It is my pleasure.@0003
Tryffin, your master is
a very kind-hearted person.@0003
@000C@0017I've put her through a
lot of difficulty.@0003
I'm sure she never wanted to
turn her back on Bern...@0003
I dragged her along with me...@0003
@0009@0017Do you really think so?@0003
@000C@0016...?@0003@0016
@0009@0017I hear that Bern's training instills
absolute loyalty in its troops.@0003
Both in the knights, and in
the mounts.@0003
@000CYes, definitely.@0003
@0009If that is so, why do you think
Tryffin follows you against Bern?@0003
@000CI'm not...@0003
@0009There are other wyvern riders of
Bern in the enemy ranks we fight.@0003
There are even high-ranking
commanders and generals.@0003
If this wyvern only followed the army's
commands, she would not have stayed.@0003
@000CYes, you're right...@0003
@0009@0017Do you understand
what that means?@0003
This wyvern has a will of
her own.@0003
She chose to be with you.@0003
Just as you chose to be with
Princess Guinivere.@0003
@000C@0017...She has a will of her own...@0003
@0009@0017You are blessed,
Madam Melady.@0003
You have a close friend
at your side.@0003
I dare say you don't
even need me.@0003
@000CYes, I think
you're right...@0003
Thank you...@0003
[03D8]
@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@0121@000C@0017Chad!
There you are.@0003
@0009Something smells good...@0003
@000CHere you go.
That's your share.@0003
@0009Wow, baked tarts!@0003
Where'd you get these?@0003
@000CThe man who delivers our meals
gave me some extra ones.@0003
@0009...They look so good...
Can I really have them?@0003
@000COf course.@0003
@0009All right! Thanks!@0003@0002@0017
...They taste as
good as they look.@0003
@000CHa ha!@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000C@0017Oh, sorry.@0003
It's just that you always look
so happy when you're eating.@0003
@0009I do?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah. You look so peaceful.
I'm almost envious.@0003
@0009@0017W-what the...?
Don't make fun of me.@0003
I-I'll be going now.
Thanks for the food!@0003@0011
@000C@0017Ha ha, I wasn't making fun of you.
It's nothing to be embarrassed of.@0003
[03D9]
@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@0121@0009@0017Lugh!
Here.@0003
@000C@0017What?@0003
Oh, a new pair of shoes?
Where did you get these?@0003
@0009@0017I didn't steal them, all right?@0003
The other day I came across an
old lady who lost her key,@0003
so I helped her out and she
gave me these shoes as thanks.@0003
@000C@0017Then why don't you wear them?
She gave them to you, not me.@0003
@0009@0017No, it's all right.@0003
My shoes aren't as beat up as
yours, and besides,@0003
they're a little small
for me anyway.@0003
@000C@0017But we're the same size.@0003
If they're small for you, they
must be small for me, too.@0003
@0009@0017J-just take them!@0003
I'm older, so my feet are a
little bigger than yours!@0003
@000C@0017What?
That's not how it works!@0003
@0009@0017Of course it is!
End of story.@0003
@0017Just take the shoes,
all right?@0003
See you.@0003@0011
@000CChad!
...Thanks.@0003
[03DA]
@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@0121@000C@0017Chad!@0003
What's wrong?
Is something on your mind?@0003
@0009Lugh...@0003
I was just thinking that we've been
in this army for a while now.@0003
I wonder how the children are
doing...@0003
@000CYeah, I wonder.@0003
@0017I hope they're being good
for the Elimine priests...@0003
@0009@0017I wonder if they're waiting
for us to return...@0003
@000C...I'm sure they are.
We're family.@0003
@0009I've got to say...
I'm glad you came.@0003
@000COh?@0003
Do you finally think
I'm strong enough?@0003
@0009I already knew that
you were strong...@0003
@000C@0017Then what?@0003
@0009@0017How can I say this...?@0003
Your twin brother, Raigh.@0003
I always felt I was the odd one
out when we three were together.@0003
@000CDon't be ridiculous!@0003
You're family to me, just
as much as Raigh is!@0003
@0009Yeah, I know!
I know better now.@0003
I was just creating a
wall around myself.@0003
But now I know that
you're family.@0003
@000C@0017...OK, I'll let it slide.@0003
You're my older brother, even if
you are...a little childish.@0003
@0009@0017What?!
Get back here, Lugh!@0003
@000C@0017Ha ha ha ha!@0003
[03DB]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0111@000C@0017Hey!
Raigh!@0003
@0009...Chad.@0003
I don't recall
summoning you.@0003
@000CLook, I wouldn't be here
if I didn't need to be.@0003
@0009What do you want?@0003
@000CRoy...@0003
I mean Lord Roy wants
to see us.@0003
@0009You think I care?!@0003
@000CP-pipe down!
Don't be so loud!@0003
That Merlinus guy'll
be after us again!@0003
@0009@0017You're afraid of that
old geezer, aren't you?@0003
@000C@0017Well, sure.@0003
He and Lord Roy
are nobles.@0003
@0009@0017Ha ha. Little Chad bows
down to nobles now, does he?@0003
@000C@0017...Laugh if you like.
But let me say this.@0003
Nobility don't like to
be opposed.@0003
Lord Roy doesn't seem like
he would anger too easily,@0003
but I don't know about
the others.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I don't want to see the
people I care about get hurt.@0003
I know you're proud of that
mouth of yours,@0003
but unless you want to be
killed, keep it shut.@0003
...I'm going.
You better come, too.@0003@0011
@0009@0016......@0003
[03DC]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0111@0009@0017...Hey.@0003
@000C...What?@0003
@0009You still steal, don't you?@0003
@000CI've got no choice.
I can't use magic like you.@0003
My only use in this army is picking
locks and gathering intel...@0003
@0009No, I think it's
invaluable.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009The other day when we went
to see that Roy fellow...@0003
He said he appreciated our work
because we're close to his age.@0003
But you humbled yourself the
whole time, belittling your work.@0003
@000CYeah? And?@0003
@0009You do something no one
else can.@0003
Have some pride in it.@0003
You look stupid when you
put yourself down.@0003
@000C...Uh, are you trying
to cheer me up?@0003
@0009D-don't be ridiculous!@0003
Why would I ever want to
cheer you up?!@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I thought so.@0003
Good, you had me
worried for a second.@0003
@0009@0017...Fine!
I'm leaving!@0003
@000CHey! What's your problem?@0003
[03DD]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0111@000CHey!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000C@0017Don't ignore me.
I need to talk to you.@0003
@0009About what?@0003
@000CWhat are you planning to do
when the war ends?@0003
@0009...You first.@0003
@000CI'll go see the children.@0003
Then I'll try and get enough
money to rebuild the orphanage.@0003
@0009Then I'll go with you.@0003
@0017I can help out until the
kids have a home at least.@0003
@000C...I thought you would.@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000CI knew you had a
heart deep down inside.@0003
@0009@0017Wh--?!@0003
@000C@0017Lugh always said you were a
kind boy.@0003
I used to think he only defended
you because you're brothers,@0003
but I guess not.@0003
Your brother knows the real you.@0003
@0009@0017...You're just as naive
as Lugh!@0003
Say what you will!
I'm leaving!@0003@0011
@000C@0017Hah, there's no need
to be embarrassed...@0003
Hey! Wait! You're
actually leaving?!@0003
[03DE]
@000E@0010@012C@000C@0010@0111@000E@0080@000BHey.@0003
@000C@0017Whoa!
Who are you?@0003
@0009@0017You've got talent.@0003
@000C@0017OK, so who are you?@0003
@0009@0017...You don't know me?
I'm Cath, Master Thief!@0003
@000C@0017...Who?@0003
@0009...Stupid, ignorant...
I'm a better thief than you.@0003
@0017You're below me. You should
be begging me for tips.@0003
@000C@0017I don't think so.@0003
I learned how to steal all on my own,
and I'm gonna keep it that way.@0003
@0009@0017No, you won't get any further
like that.@0003
I guess I can take you under my wing.
Show you the ropes. Since you insist.@0003
@000C@0017Wait,
when did I--@0003
@0009@0017Now you're my first apprentice.
You must do my bidding.@0003
@000C@0017Why should I?!@0003
@0009@0017I know one good reason.
Isn't this your bag?@0003
@000C@0017H-hey!
When did you...?!@0003
Give it back!@0003
[03DF]
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0111@000C@0017Hey!@0003
@0009@0017Oh, it's you.@0003
@000C@0017Give me back my bag!
Now!@0003
@0009Easy there, fella.
Here ya go.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016@0017What are those sketches?
Who is that?@0003
@000C@0017Poppa... Not my real
father, but close enough.@0003
@0009@0017...You're an orphan.@0003
@000C@0017...I wasn't the brightest student,
but Poppa always praised my drawings.@0003
He said I had nimble fingers and
that I could be an artist someday...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
I see...@0003@0002
@0016......
......@0003
@0016Argh!@0003
Now things are awkward.
I like it positive.@0003
You should too, Firsty.@0003
@000CWhat do you mean
by "Firsty"? @0003
@0009@0017That's you.@0003
You're my first
apprentice, remember?@0003
@000C@0017I never agreed to that!@0003
[03E0]
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0111@0009Hey, Firsty.
How ya been?@0003
@000C@0017...Fine.@0003
@0009@0017I've been watching you.
You seem to be improving.@0003
You're still nowhere near
my level, though. Of course.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, whatever.
I'm not your apprentice.@0003
@0009Hey, wait.@0003@0017
If not my apprentice, then
how about my partner?@0003
@000C@0017...Partner?@0003
@0009@0017Yeah.
We could be partners.@0003
The fabled pair of thieves
out to save the poor!@0003@0002
Sounds pretty cool, huh?@0003
@000C@0017Partners...@0003@0002
...Sounds stupid.
No thanks.@0003@0011
@0009What? Wait a minute!@0003
I'm Cath, Master Thief!
You should be honored!@0003
Come back here!@0003
[03E1]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0111@000C@0017Hey! Are you Hugh?@0003
@0009Huh? So what if
I am, kid?@0003
@000C...Is it true that you're
a moneylender?@0003
@0009Maybe. Why?@0003
@000CI want to borrow 3,000 gold.@0003
@0009@0017Well, you're out of luck, kid.@0003
I only lend money to grown-ups.
Especially to lovely ladies.@0003
@000C@0017...Oh.@0003
All right, I'll ask
someone else then.@0003
@0009@0017Hey, hey, hey,
slow down there.@0003
Have a little more
persistence, kid.@0003
You can't give up
so easily.@0003
@000C@0017But you only lend money
to adults, don't you?@0003
@0009@0017Well, if you insist, I can
make an exception for you.@0003
But your interest will be
twice the normal rate.@0003
@000C@0017I thought you'd say
something like that.@0003
...But fine.
Let me borrow the money.@0003
I'll give it back when
we get paid.@0003
@0009@0017One, two, three.
Here you go, 3,000 gold.@0003
@000C@0017Thanks.
See you later.@0003@0011
@0009@0017Remember, it's 4,000 after
interest!@0003
@0017...How could I turn him down
after he looked at me like that?@0003
This is why I hate kids...@0003
[03E2]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0111@000C@0017Hey! Here's the
money I owe you.@0003
@0009@0017One, two, three, four.
Yup, that's 4,000.@0003
I haven't seen you around lately
so I thought you ran off with it.@0003
@000C@0017I keep my promises.
What kind of person doesn't?@0003
@0009@0017You'd be surprised.@0003
You're an honest kid. You sure
you chose the right career?@0003
@000C@0017Stop calling me "kid".
My name is Chad.@0003
@0009@0017All right, Chad.@0003
So tell me, why'd you
become a thief?@0003
@000C@0017...Stealing's the only way
I could live. I'm an orphan.@0003
@0009Did you live alone?@0003
@000CNo, I lived in a small orphanage
in Lycia near the border to Bern.@0003
I grew up with other orphans.@0003
We did pretty well. Poppa and
the other kids and me...@0003
...If this war hadn't broken
out, I'd still be there.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Poppa was a good man,@0003
but he could only keep the orphanage
running through charity.@0003
After the war started we began
to run low on food and clothes.@0003
I was the oldest of the orphans,
but I couldn't find any work.@0003
So the only way to get food was
to steal.@0003
@0009@0017Then I'm guessing you sent that
3,000 gold to the orphanage...@0003
@000C@0017No.@0003
...The orphanage isn't
there anymore.@0003
@0009What?!@0003
@000CPoppa was killed by Bern's troops
and the place was burned down...@0003
@0009W-what about the children?
Were they spared?@0003
@000CThanks to Poppa, yeah.
None of us were hurt.@0003
The children are with the
St. Elimine Church now.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I used the money to buy a
strong sword.@0003
I'm going to use it to end
this war quickly.@0003
Then I can go back to the
children!@0003
@0009So the kids are family to you.
You want to protect them.@0003
@000CThat's right.
I've got nothing else.@0003
You got a problem
with that?@0003
@0009@0017Not at all...@0003
I'm sorry I was so rude
with you before.@0003
You've already grown up, Chad.@0003
You're certainly more of an
adult than I am.@0003
[03E3]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0111@0009Hey! Chad!
Have you been doing well?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I guess.
But not as well as you.@0003
@0009Man, are you always
such a downer?@0003
Can't you be more like,@0003@0017
"Hey, Hugh! What's up?"
And smile for a change.@0003
@000C@0017...I think I'd vomit if
I tried to do that.@0003
@0009Aw, come on!@0003
Your story really made me
think. I want to help you!@0003
@000C...Are you really a mage, old man?@0003
You seem more like some kind of
jester or something.@0003
@0009O-old man!?@0003
Does this handsome face look
like it belongs to an "old man"?!@0003
@000CYeah. Well, compared
to mine, anyway.@0003
@0009Ugh!
Daggers through my heart!@0003
...I take personal offense
to "old man".@0003
Seriously, you can call me
anything.@0003
Smelly, messy, stupid, anything.
Just don't call me "old man"!@0003
I feel like my soul has died
a little after hearing that!@0003
@000C@0017
...Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!@0003
Ha ha...huff... My...my stomach...!
Ha ha ha...!@0003
@0009@0016!!@0003@0016
@000COh man, that reaction was
priceless.@0003
I really pressed your buttons
with that, didn't I?@0003
Fine, I'll call you Hugh.
You're OK with that, aren't you?@0003
Since you claim you're not
an old man.@0003
@0009So you are capable of
laughing after all!@0003
@000C@0017Huh?@0003
@0009You've always got that
glare in your eyes.@0003
Your brow is always
furrowed like you're mad.@0003
And you're rude, you
have an attitude,@0003
and you never smile.@0003
@000CSorry, what are you
talking about?@0003
@0009I've seen so many kids lose the
ability to laugh thanks to this war.@0003
Grown-ups have a lot of issues,
but come on, kids have to laugh.@0003
Even if the idiots who start these
wars don't think so.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016@0017If there are still kids who can laugh,
then maybe there is hope after all.@0003
I know you've had it rough, but you
have to laugh once in a while, OK?@0003
@000C@0017H-hey!
Don't mess up my hair!@0003
@0009@0017Ha ha ha ha, sorry!
I'll see you later.@0003
Just don't screw up!@0003@0011
@000C...Maybe adults aren't all
as awful as I thought...@0003
[03E4]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0113@000CUncle!@0003
@0009@0017Ah, Fir.@0003
@000C@0017Please let me stay with you so
I can master the sword!@0003
@0009@0017If that's what you want.@0003
@000C@0017Thank you!
...But...@0003@0017
It doesn't feel right to fight
alongside you.@0003
I'm still a novice, but you're the
strongest fighter in our army!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016None of them know how strong
you are!@0003
Once they see the true strength
of the Sword Saint, they'll...@0003
@0009Fir.@0003
@000CY-yes?@0003
@0009That's inappropriate.@0003
@000CI...I respect you so much,
so I just...@0003
@0009Idolizing another is
pointless.@0003
One must not seek strength
for admiration.@0003
@000C...Yes, Uncle.@0003
[03E5]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0113@000CUncle...@0003
@0009@0017What is it,
Fir?@0003
@000C@0017Please, teach me the
way of the sword!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000CI want to know how you
gained your power.@0003
I want to master the
sword like you did.@0003
@0009@0017The way of the sword...@0003
@000CYes!@0003
@0009It is not something that
can be taught, Fir.@0003
@000CWhat...?@0003
@0009A sword is simply a sword.
It is a weapon used to kill people.@0003
@000CThat...@0003
That's not true!@0003
@0009There's no strength to be found in
this hunk of metal.@0003
I have lived by the sword since my birth,
but my blade never gained any power.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016True strength does not
come from a weapon.@0003
It is not something that
can be seen or touched.@0003
But it exists within all
of us.@0003
It exists within you,
too, Fir.@0003
@000C@0017M-me...?@0003
[03E6]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0113
@000C@0017Please tell me,
Uncle!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016What is true strength...?
What is the right way...?@0003
What must I do...?@0003
@0009...Fir.@0003
You have always followed in
your mother's footsteps.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Now that you've lost sight of your
mother, you come to me for advice.@0003
@000C...Yes.@0003
@0009But Fir.@0003
You are not your mother.
You are not me.@0003
You cannot follow us to
the path you seek.@0003
It lies in front of you.@0003
It is you who must cut
that path for yourself.@0003
@000C@0017It's...in front of me?@0003
@0009@0017It isn't something that can
be taught.@0003
It is something you must
discover on your own.@0003
@000C@0017...I understand.
Thank you, Uncle!@0003
[03E7]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0120@000C@0017I...I'm so sorry about Karla.@0003
I just wish it could have
been me instead of her.@0003
@0009@0017Honestly, my sister's health
was never particularly good.@0003
I'm just glad she lived as
long as she did.@0003
@000C@0017I'm sorry...@0003
@0009@0017The one thing I am concerned
about is Fir.@0003
She lost her mother at such
a young age...@0003
@000C@0017Yes... Maybe...@0003
Maybe the reason she left to train was
to get her mind off her mother's death.@0003
@0009She left to train?@0003
Is Fir traveling
across Elibe?@0003
@000CThat she is.@0003
She said she wanted to become a
great swordmaster like her mother.@0003
@0009Is that so...@0003
[03E8]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0120@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009Bartre...
What's the matter?@0003
@000C@0017Ah, Karel.@0003
...I was just thinking
about Karla.@0003
@0009Again?@0003
@000CYes, always.@0003
I first met her in my travels around
the world, when I was training.@0003
I remember it like it was yesterday...
We first met at that arena.@0003
Her sword...
I couldn't even see it.@0003
...I suffered defeat for
the first time in my life.@0003
@0009...In our family, the sword was
everything.@0003
We were raised by the sword,
and it was all we knew.@0003
The sword was so central to our lives...
that it blinded us to our own humanity.@0003
@000CEach time I lost, I challenged
her to a rematch.@0003
And then, the third time we fought,
I somehow evaded her first strike.@0003
I was knocked unconscious by her
second strike, though...@0003
But when I woke up...
there she was.@0003
It was the first time I'd seen
her smile.@0003
After that, we traveled together,
training ourselves to be ever stronger.@0003@0002
I was never able to defeat her.@0003
@0009@0017I didn't see my sister
smile very often...@0003
She must have been
very fond of you.@0003
@000C@0017Do you think so...?@0003
[03E9]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0120@000C@0017...After she fell sick, Karla told me
about her family for the first time.@0003
She talked about her heritage, about
you, and...about herself.@0003
@0009@0017I'm sure my sister was happy to be
with you in her time in this world.@0003
@000C@0017That was around the time that
I first met you as well...@0003
You resembled Karla when I
first met her.@0003
You were inhumanly strong...
Dangerous and quiet.@0003
@0009...That sounds like me.@0003
I remember leaving the two
of you without a word.@0003@0017
You must have thought me a
terrible brother.@0003
@000C@0017No, not at all.@0003
As she lay dying, Karla told me
about her childhood with you...@0003
She would tell me so many stories,
all with a smile on her face.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
...Is that so...@0003
[03EA]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0114@000C@0016!@0003
@0009@0016You noticed me at this distance?
Very impressive.@0003
@000C@0017...Karel the Sword Saint.@0003
@0009You know of me?
I am honored.@0003
@000C...Everyone who wields the
sword knows your name.@0003
@0009@0017Yes, well, I traveled
a lot in my youth.@0003
@000C@0017...Why are you in this army?@0003
@0009@0017My family is here, so
I joined as well.@0003
I only hope I'm not
too rusty.@0003
@000C@0017Rusty?
Surely you jest.@0003
@0009@0017No, it is no jest.@0003
I'm sure I can't hold a
candle to you younger ones.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016@0011@0007
@0009...Interesting fellow.@0003
[03EB]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0114@0009Please wait a moment.@0003
@000C@0017...What do you want?@0003
@0009@0017I am looking for a
sparring partner.@0003
Would you care to
practice with me?@0003
@000C@0017...No.@0003
@0009@0017Why not?@0003
Am I unworthy of
sparring with you?@0003
@000C@0017Your sword is not soaked red...
I pursue a different path.@0003
@0009@0017Perhaps you think so now, but we
both follow the way of the sword...@0003
All paths of the sword lead to
the same destination.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
[03EC]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0114@0009...Do you need something,
Rutger?@0003
@000C@0017I want to ask you something.@0003
@0009@0017Yes?@0003
@000C@0017I sense no hatred from your sword...@0003
You seem to blend with the air
when you attack.@0003
Even the heaviest, strongest
blades can't be one with the air...@0003
Your sword bests them all.
I want to be stronger.@0003
If all paths of the sword lead
to one place,@0003
will I someday be able to blend
with the air as you do?@0003
@0009@0017...You're from Sacae,
aren't you?@0003
@000C@0017...Yes.@0003
@0009@0017I was born in Sacae as well.@0003
I grew up under the eye of our Father
the Sky and our Mother the Earth.@0003
They are the only ones within
my blade.@0003
@000C@0017I'm not pure Sacaen...@0003
I can't sense them
like you do...@0003
@0009@0017Could you hear them when
you were young?@0003
@000C@0016!!@0003@0016
@0009You were able to hear the Sky
and the Earth once.@0003
Your hate deafens your ears.@0003
@000C@0017...Do you think I will be able to
hear them when this war ends?@0003
@0009@0017Of course you will.@0003
The breeze that blows
through the plains...@0003
It never forgets those
it loves.@0003
[03ED]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@012A@000C@0017You're the Sword Saint...?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016@0017...That's not what I prefer
to be called.@0003
Karel will do.@0003
@000C@0017Sir Karel, I am a
wyvern rider of Bern.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016...You're not going to say
anything?@0003
My father said you fought
against Bern in the past.@0003
He saw you in a rain of blood,@0003
slicing through all who
crossed your path...@0003
@0009@0017...I am through caring about the
goings-on of the world.@0003
Bern, Etruria, Lycia...
They are meaningless to me now.@0003
I am only here now for my family.@0003
@000C@0017...I envy you.
I wish I could be so unconcerned...@0003
But I can't...@0003
Not even now that Bern has fallen...@0003
[03EE]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@012A@000C@0017Before making it here...
I fought my older brother.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016We weren't related by blood,
but we truly were brothers...@0003
His name was Galle.@0003
He was a wyvern rider that easily
rivaled the Wyvern Generals in skill.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I always looked up to him.
My sister was also very fond of him...@0003
...I never thought he would end up
as our enemy.@0003
I never conceived that we would
have to fight Galle...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I'm sorry...@0003
Have I bored you?@0003
@0009@0017No, not at all.@0003
A life story is
never boring.@0003
[03EF]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@012A
@0009Zeiss.@0003
@000C@0017Yes?@0003
@0009@0017Why...?@0003
Why did you tell
me that story?@0003
@000C@0017...I thought you might have some
guidance for me...@0003
I thought you might help rid
me of my unease...@0003
@0009@0017...I'm afraid I have no
advice for you.@0003
But...I will say this.@0003
You must carve your
own path.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Zeiss...@0003
I think you already
know your answer.@0003
@000C@0017...Maybe.@0003
Perhaps...I just wanted someone to tell
me that my path is the correct one.@0003
@0009@0017Then...@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I understand now.@0003
I chose to turn against my country...
and I don't regret that decision.@0003
[03F0]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0130@000C@0017...I've never heard of
this place before.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016@0017This is a land that people have
long forgotten.@0003
The years go by, but time
doesn't seem to pass...@0003
That is the best way to
describe this place.@0003
@000C@0017Have you always lived here?@0003
@0009@0017No. I used to travel the world.
I lived by the sword.@0003
@000C@0017
Then...have you ever
been to Ilia?@0003
@0009@0017...Yes. Once.@0003
[03F1]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0130@000CThe Sword Saint...@0003
Does that name ring
any bells?@0003
@0009...No.@0003
@000CMy mother used to tell me
stories about him.@0003
When I was very young,@0003
a group of bandits attacked
our village.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000CIf the Sword Saint hadn't saved
us, I wouldn't be here today.@0003
Wherever he is, I hope he knows
how much I appreciate him...@0003
@0009...No. There's nothing
to be grateful for.@0003
@000C...What? Why do
you say that?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
[03F2]
@0009@0010@0112@000C@0010@0130@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Sir Karel...@0003
@0009@0017I suppose I should tell you the
truth.@0003
To cover my shame would be to go
astray from the way of the sword.@0003
@000CShame?
You saved my village...@0003
@0009No. I never cared about
saving the village.@0003
I just wanted to kill.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I was a demon back then...
possessed by the sword.@0003
I wandered aimlessly, looking
to sate my bloodlust.@0003
I didn't care who I cut.
Who I killed.@0003
...I'd have even killed you,
I'm sure.@0003
@000C@0016!@0003@0016
@0009You have no reason to thank me.
They call me the Sword Saint...@0003
But it is a false name.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017When I look at you, I can't even
begin to believe what you're saying.@0003
You are the Sword Saint I've always
pictured in my mind.@0003
What...happened...?@0003
@0009@0017...Some things we only realize
after suffering a great loss.@0003
By the time my foolishness had
left me...it was already too late.@0003
[03F3]
@000C@0010@0120@000C@0017Fiiirrr!
Where are you?@0003
Fiiirrr!@0003@0002
@000CFiiirrr!@0003
@0009@0010@0113F-Father...
You are much too loud.@0003
@000C@0017Ah, there you are, Fir!
It's good to see you safe!@0003
@0009@0017Father...@0003
@000CI hadn't seen you for
a while.@0003
I was worried you'd
disappeared forever.@0003
@0009Don't be ridiculous,
Father...@0003
We were just sparring
not long ago.@0003
@000C
We don't have many chances to talk
one-on-one, daughter and father.@0003
@0017Now is your chance, Fir.@0003
Tell your father anything
that's on your mind.@0003
@0009@0017F-Father...@0003
I'm sorry, but I have
orders from Lord Roy.@0003
@000C@0017Do you?
Then I shall accompany you.@0003
@0009@0017I'm grateful, but I need to
do things on my own.@0003
Otherwise, I won't improve
the way I want to.@0003
I'll see you again, Father.@0003@0011
@000CHrmm...
Be careful, my daughter.@0003
[03F4]
@000C@0010@0120@000C@0017Fiiirrr!@0003
@000CFiiirrr!@0003@0002
@000CWhere are you,
my daughter?@0003
@0009@0010@0113F-Father...@0003
There's no need to
shout so loudly...@0003
@000CI've been hearing some
troubling rumors, Fir.@0003
I hear that another man in the
army is secretly seeing you.@0003
@0009Oh...@0003
@000CIs it true, my daughter?
If so, fear not!@0003
I will crush anyone who
would hurt you!@0003
@0009N-no, it's nothing like that!@0003
@0009He's helping me with my training.
That's all.@0003
@000C@0017Oho, so you merely wanted a
training partner.@0003
Have no worries, my daughter.
Your father is here to train you!@0003
Now come, punch me as hard
as you can!@0003
@0009@0017Um...@0003
I appreciate it, but I need
someone who can use a sword...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I'm sorry, Father...@0003@0011
@000CHrmm...@0003
Take care of yourself,
my daughter.@0003
[03F5]
@000C@0010@0120@000C@0017Fiiirrr!@0003@0002
@000CFiii--@0003
@0009@0010@0113I'm right here!@0003
@000CAh, Fir.
You are unharmed...@0003
@0009Father!
Enough is enough!@0003
I'm quite fine on my own!
I don't need you to protect me!@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016...I'm sorry.
I was wrong...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Forgive me, my daughter...@0003
I just wanted to make
up for lost time.@0003
@0009Lost...time?@0003
@000CYes...@0003
When you were still young, your
mother and I were always training.@0003
I regret now that I didn't give
you the attention you needed.@0003
You never knew the warmth and
protection a parent can give...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016You've grown into such a strong
and confident young woman.@0003
You did that all on your own.@0003
I just wanted to help you in
any way I could...@0003
@0009Father... You were always kind
and loving.@0003
Whenever I was down, you held me in
your strong arms and comforted me...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Father...
I've always loved you.@0003
@000C@0017Fir...
Oh, my daughter!@0003
@0009F-Father!@0003
This isn't the place to
break down and cry!@0003
[03F6]
@0009@0010@0130@000C@0010@0113@000C@0017Sir Noah!@0003
@0009@0017Hello, Fir.@0003
@000C@0017Sir Noah, I have something
to ask of you...@0003
@0009@0017OK. Shoot.@0003
@000C@0017I want to spar
with you.@0003
@0009@0017Oh... For your training?@0003
@000C@0017Yes. I must experience all forms
of swordplay to master the art.@0003
You taught me some things at
that arena, and...@0003
I would appreciate some
additional training.@0003
@0009@0017Well, if that's what you want,
then sure, no problem.@0003
@000CReally?
Thank you!@0003
Let's start now,
then...@0003@0002@0014@0005
Wha--!?@0003@0080@000E
@0009@0017Whoa!
Are you OK?@0003
@000CY-yes!
I'm sorry!@0003
I'm up, I'm up...@0003
@0009It's not like you to
trip like that.@0003
Are you hurt?
Let me see your knee...@0003
@000CN-no... I-I'm fine!
We must continue sparring!@0003
@0009Are you really OK?
You don't seem quite...well.@0003
@000CW-we fight!@0003
[03F7]
@0009@0010@0130@000C@0010@0113@0009Hello, Fir.@0003
@000C@0017S-Sir Noah...@0003
@0009Are you OK?@0003
You should tell me if
you're not feeling well...@0003
@000CI-I'm fine.@0003
@0009You look like
you have a fever...@0003
@000CI-it's nothing!@0003
@0009But...your face is
bright red.@0003
@000CI said it's nothing!@0003
I'm just in a little
slump is all!@0003
@0009Fir? Is something on
your mind?@0003
If you need someone to
talk to, I'd be happy to...@0003
@000CS-Sir Noah!
I don't mean to be rude, but...@0003
D-don't talk to me anymore!@0003@0011@0007
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
...Fir.@0003
[03F8]
@0009@0010@0130@000C@0010@0113@000C@0017@0016!@0003@0016
@0009Wait, Fir!
Don't go.@0003
I need to talk to you.@0003
@000CI-I...@0003
I swore to myself that I would
live by the sword.@0003
But...@0003
I find my mind wandering.
It's always focused on you!@0003
@0009Fir...@0003
@000CG-goodbye!@0003@0011
@0009Fir!@0003
@000C@0010@0113Wha--@0003
@0009Do you remember the
first time we met?@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009Ever since then, I've wanted to
tell you something.@0003
But I could never muster up the
courage to say it.@0003
Even after we said our
good-byes,@0003
I always regretted not telling
you how I felt.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009I believe fate brought us back
together when we met again on the Isles.@0003
I've been keeping it in all this
time, but I can't any longer.@0003
I have to tell you.@0003
@000CS-Sir Noah...@0003
@0009Fir, I...@0003@0002@0005
I love you.@0003
[03F9]
@000C@0010@0113@0009@0010@0114@000C@0017...Um...@0003
@000CUh, excuse me,
are you Rutger?@0003
@0009...What do you want?@0003
@000C@0017I was wondering if you would spar
with me, if we get the chance.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000CI've been training my skills and
I've won at many arenas around Elibe.@0003
So you don't have to go easy on me!@0003
@0009@0017...I won't spar with you.@0003
@000CWhy not?
Is it because I'm a woman?@0003
@0009...I swing my sword to kill.@0003
I have no interest in using
the blade for play.@0003
@000CPlay?!@0003@0009@0011
@000CW-wait...!@0003@0002
...He thinks of sparring as
"play"?@0003
I was hoping to learn from him.@0003
His blade is sharp and he has
no hesitation in his eyes...@0003
[03FA]
@000C@0010@0113@0009@0010@0114@000C@0017Rutger!
We fight!@0003
@0009...Get out of my way.@0003
@000CNo. I will not move until you
understand that I am serious.@0003
Draw your sword!@0003
I train myself seriously.@0003
I will not tolerate you calling
my training mere "play". @0003
I want to become stronger,
so I want to learn from you.@0003
@0009...I told you that I use
my sword to kill.@0003
@000CYes, I know.
But my...@0003
@0009If I draw my blade here,
you will die.@0003
Is that your wish?@0003
@000C@0016...!@0003@0016
@0009You don't intend to
kill me, do you?@0003
@000CWell, no...@0003
@0009That's why your
training is play.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009......@0003@0016@0011
@000C...I just...@0003
...Maybe I was being rude.@0003
I should apologize the next
time I see him.@0003
[03FB]
@000C@0010@0113@0009@0010@0114@000CRutger.@0003
Wait, please don't glare
at me like that...@0003
I'm not here to fight.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000CBut your skills are impressive.
I want to reach your level.@0003
All I want is to be as strong
as you...@0003
@0009@0017...Just be yourself.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009My blade is soaked in blood.@0003
Our paths differ too greatly
for you to learn from me.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0017A great man once told me,@0003
"All paths of the sword lead
to the same destination."@0003
I don't know if that's true,@0003
but I can tell you've gone
down one of those paths.@0003
I still have much to learn,
so I...@0003
@0009@0017...Think what you will.@0003
[03FC]
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0115@000C@0017Ack!@0003
@0009...Good as ever,
I see.@0003
@000C...Rutger...
Stop trying to kill me from behind!@0003
I'd have a heart attack if I had to
deal with you on a daily basis.@0003
@0009@0017Ha...@0003
I'll get my sword through
your back one day.@0003
@000C@0017OK, I get it, we hated each other
when we were on different sides.@0003
But why do you want to slice me in half
now that we're in the same army?@0003
@0009The others bore me.@0003
I need someone of your
strength to duel.@0003
@000CSo you're gonna kill me all
because you're bored.@0003
Fantastic.@0003
@0009As if you've ever let
my sword cut you...@0003
@000CI can't be on guard all the time!
I don't wanna die!@0003
@0009Yeah. I'll get you
next time.@0003@0011
@000CWhat a guy...@0003
[03FD]
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0115@000C@0016......@0003@0009@0011@000C@0011@0007
@000C@0010@0115@0016@0017
Hey! I told you to
cut that out!@0003
You don't know
when to quit...!@0003
@0009@0010@0114@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Hm...?
You seem to be in a bad mood.@0003
Did something happen?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Lemme guess...@0003
You spotted a personal
enemy in Bern's ranks?@0003
@0009@0016!@0003@0016
@000CBullseye.@0003
Why are you taking
it out on me?@0003
@0009...I saw the man who led the
attack on my hometown of Bulgar.@0003
But when I reached him...
he was already dead.@0003
You defeated him, Dieck.@0003
Those sword marks...
It had to be you.@0003
@000C...Sorry.@0003
Had I known, I would have
left him to you.@0003
@0009...This is a battlefield.
Enemies don't belong to anybody.@0003
@000CRutger... Seriously, take
it easy once in a while.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0011
@000C@0016You can't live life on
edge all the time...@0003
[03FE]
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0115@000C@0017Rutger, you all right?
You don't look well.@0003
@0009...I'm having trouble sleeping.@0003
@000CIs it about the man who led
the Bulgar attack?@0003
@0009...No.@0003
Well...maybe.@0003
Even after seeing him dead, the
nightmares still persist.@0003
In that attack...they
spared me...@0003
The reason was because I...
I didn't look Sacaen.@0003
@000CTough to kill someone with
the same face.@0003
But you do have Sacaen blood
in you, don't you?@0003
@0009Yes. My father's mother and my
mother's father were Sacaen.@0003
Bulgar is near Bern's border, so many
people of mixed blood lived there.@0003
Usually the Sacaen blood shows itself
more prominently.@0003
But...@0003
But I was different. I appear to be
of Bern, so I was left alive...@0003
The people of Bulgar...were kind to
me, even though I looked different...@0003
But they...they were all killed,
and so brutally!@0003
I must raze the entirety of the
Kingdom of Bern to the ground...!@0003
One man isn't enough to satisfy
my revenge...@0003
@000CI always wondered if you had some
story, but now it all makes sense...@0003
@0017Hope you don't mind me tagging along.@0003
@0009@0017Keep your sympathy!@0003
@000C@0017Come on. You know how strong I am.@0003
If you really want to take on Bern,
what better ally is there than me?@0003
What do you say?@0003
@0009@0017...Do as you will.@0003
@000C@0017And I will.
Let's go, partner!@0003@0011
@0009@0017Dieck...
I'm sorry.@0003
[03FF]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@011E@0009@0017Ward. Let me talk
to you for a sec.@0003
@000CWhuh?
Sure.@0003
@0009Pay more attention to what's
going on around you.@0003
The way you fight, you're just
asking to be killed.@0003
@000CAw, c'mon, Big Man, I haven't
died yet.@0003
I can crush anything with
these massive arms...@0003
@0009I've heard those same words from
plenty of young hotshots before.@0003
They're all dead now.@0003
You just worry me is all.@0003
@000CWell, all right...@0003
You're the boss,
Big Man.@0003
@0009Good.@0003
I'm glad you can take
some criticism.@0003
[0400]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@011E@0009@0017...Ward.@0003
@000CBig Man!
Did you see me?!@0003
I took down three guys
with one swing...@0003
@0009Do you even remember
what I told you?@0003
@000CHuh?
Uhh...@0003@0002
Charge?@0003
@0009No!@0003
I told you to pay more attention
to your surroundings.@0003
@000CFighting like that just
doesn't sit well with me.@0003
I'm getting even stronger,
too.@0003
I'll crush anyone who
dares stand up to me.@0003@0011
@0009Ward!@0003
@0017...That kid can't
sit still, can he?@0003
[0401]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@011E@000C@0017Big Man...@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
@000C@0017Sorry. You win.@0003
I almost got myself killed earlier,
then I remembered what you told me.@0003
Maybe I was getting carried away...@0003
@0009Yeah, I think so.@0003
@000CSince then, I've been
following your advice...@0003
@0009@0017I can see that.
You're still alive.@0003
If you pay more attention, you
won't die like a fool.@0003
With your strength, you can impress
people no matter how you fight.@0003
@000C@0017...Are you OK?
You're, like...praising me.@0003
It feels...weird.@0003
@0009Shut up.
Let's go.@0003
[0402]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@0115@0009@0017Hey Big Man, what do you
think of our employer?@0003
@000C@0017That Roy kid?@0003
You first.@0003
@0009I like him.@0003
He's an impressive
commander for his age.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, he is.@0003
But...he's young.
Too young.@0003
@0009Maybe so, but...@0003
@000CI understand why you like him.@0003
He's a nice kid, and he's got
brains and guts.@0003
But...these battles are all
small-time.@0003
When we get to a real battle, and
he's in a life or death situation...@0003
That's when we'll see what kind of
leader he really is...@0003 
[0403]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@0115@000C@0017Years ago...when I first
became a mercenary...@0003
All I cared about was
making a name for myself...@0003
@0009@0017Really...?
I wouldn't have expected that.@0003
@000C@0017Our squad was sent right behind
enemy lines.@0003
Our mission was to go deep into
Bern and finish the enemy leader.@0003
We waited in a cave for days...
and then the time came.@0003
When we moved out...arrows
rained down on us...@0003
@0009What?!
Why...?@0003
@000COur employer...@0003
He had put us there so he could
buy time for himself and escape.@0003
Our squad was decimated.
They killed everyone.@0003
Except for me, of course.
They tortured me for information.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016We mercenaries are expendable
in a client's eyes.@0003
That's the norm.
You need to understand that.@0003
@0009But...that Roy kid...@0003
@000C@0017Yeah...he's different.
I just wish I'd met him sooner...@0003
[0404]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@0115@000CSo...
We're still alive.@0003
@0009That we are.@0003
@000C...Funny, isn't it?@0003
@0009What is?@0003
@000CWe're mercenaries.@0003
We shouldn't care who wins. We fight
for money and self-preservation.@0003
We're better off walking away from
a tough fight than staying.@0003
But...it's different now.@0003
We've been through so many tough
battles, and still, here I am.@0003
Roy...makes me feel like I fight
for a purpose.@0003
Like I could die for him and have
no regrets.@0003
@0009You took the words right
out of my mouth.@0003
[0405]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@0129@000CHey, Captain!@0003
@0009@0017Shanna, please.
Don't call me "Captain."@0003
@000CWhy not?@0003
Back in Ilia, we always
call our leader captain.@0003
@0009I don't like it.@0003
@000CAll right, um...@0003
OK, then I'll call you
Big Man, like Lot and Ward.@0003
@0009No.@0003
@000CShoot, can't use
that, either?@0003
@0009Just call me Dieck,
like you always have.@0003
@000CNo!@0003
I always feel left out when they call
you Big Man and I just call you Dieck.@0003
@0009Don't be ridiculous.
Come on, let's go.@0003
@000C@0017Hey, wait!
Dieck!@0003
[0406]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@0129@0009@0017Shanna, I see you fighting on
your own a lot.@0003
@000CWell, yeah. I'm on a pegasus,
as you can plainly see.@0003
I move at a different pace, so
it's easier to fight by myself.@0003
@0009I want you to slow down to
our pace from now on.@0003
@000C@0017What?
But I do fine on my own!@0003
@0009@0017It worries us when you go
charging in like that.@0003
@000CBut if I get stronger...@0003
@0009Can you stand up to a
whole army on your own?@0003
@000C...Um, no.@0003
@0009Then match your pace with the
others and work as a team.@0003
That'll maximize our chance
of victory.@0003
@000CThat'll help us win, huh?@0003
@0009Wars aren't fought alone,
you know.@0003
@000CYeah...@0003
[0407]
@0009@0010@0115@000C@0010@0129@000CDieck!@0003
See how I've been adjusting my
pace to the others lately?@0003
@0009Yeah...@0003
But don't rely on
them too much.@0003
@000C@0017Huh?@0003
That's not what you
said earlier!@0003
@0009@0017What I said then
applies to soldiers.@0003
What I'm saying now
applies to sellswords.@0003
@000CTo sellswords...?@0003
@0009A sellsword has to fend for
him or herself.@0003
No one's gonna watch
your back.@0003
Always question others.
You should even question me.@0003
Question whether my orders
serve the group,@0003
or if they're just putting you in
harm's way to protect myself.@0003
@000CI don't think that's
necessary.@0003
@0009Really now.@0003
@000CYou would never make
orders like that.@0003
@0009You can never be sure.@0003
@000CI am sure.
And so are Lot and Ward.@0003
That's why we entrust our
lives to you.@0003
@0009...Don't get cocky, kid.@0003
@000CTee hee...@0003
[0408]
@0009@0010@0116@000C@0010@0122@000CHello, Ogier!@0003
@0009@0017L-Lady Lilina!@0003
@000C@0017Oh, don't worry...@0003
I just wanted to talk
to someone from Ostia.@0003
@0009@0017Um... All right.@0003
@000C@0017So talk to me.
Let's see...@0003
Tell me about
your hometown.@0003
@0009@0017My hometown?@0003
Well...it was a pretty
ordinary village.@0003
We were poor...@0003
The reason I came all the way to
the city in the first place@0003
was to make money to feed
my younger brothers...@0003
@000C@0017You have brothers?
How nice.@0003
Do you have any
sisters?@0003
@0009@0017...I have one younger sister, too.@0003
@000C@0017Really?
What's she like?@0003
Is she cute?
Is she like you?@0003
@0009@0017The...the last time I saw her was so
long ago, so I don't really remember.@0003
But I remember holding her hand.@0003
Her hand... It was so small and
delicate.@0003
@000C@0017That's so sweet...@0003
I've always wanted
a younger sister.@0003
[0409]
@0009@0010@0116@000C@0010@0122@000COgier, how is your
sister doing?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Is she back in your village?@0003
Or did she come to Ostia
with you?@0003
If she did, I'd like to...@0003
@0009@0017I'm sorry,
Lady Lilina, but...@0003
@000C@0017Tell me.
I'd love to meet her.@0003
@0009@0017@0016......@0003@0016
She's not around anymore.@0003
@000CWhat?
Why not...?@0003
@0009Lady Lilina...@0003
Our village is very poor.
...The men work.@0003
And girls...have no place.@0003
We have so little food
to spare...@0003
When a girl is born in our
village,@0003
she's given pretty clothes
and left in a faraway city.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009...We couldn't afford her.@0003
I don't hold it against
my parents.@0003
If they hadn't done it...
we would have starved.@0003
@000C...I'm sorry...@0003
@0009Lady Lilina?@0003
@000CI'm sorry...
I...didn't know anything...@0003
I didn't know anything...
but I...I was so...@0003
@0009D-don't cry!
Please, Lady Lilina...@0003
[040A]
@0009@0010@0116@000C@0010@0122@0009@0017Lady Lilina, about before...
I'm sorry.@0003
I said more than I should have.@0003
@000CNo, Ogier.@0003
@0009Milady?@0003
@000CI'm sorry. I had no idea.
But I can't remain ignorant as I am.@0003
I may not know how to govern yet,
but I'll learn.@0003
I will make Ostia a land where our
children can live in happiness.@0003
@0009...Lady Lilina, some things
are impossible.@0003
Marquess Ostia served us well.
My brothers are all fine.@0003
Not even the gods can save
everyone.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016@0017But I can say this,
Lady Lilina...@0003
My sister, wherever
she is...@0003
I'm sure she would have
liked you very much.@0003
[040B]
@0009@0010@0126@0009Hmm... I need to work
on my twirls more...@0003
@000C@0010@0116@0017Oh...@0003
@0009@0017Who's there?!@0003
You! You saw my
secret training!@0003
@000C@0017N-no!
I didn't mean to!@0003
@0009@0017Irrelevant!@0003
Now that you've seen me,
I can't let you live.@0003
@000C@0017Y-you're going to kill me?@0003
@0009@0017Wait, I feel like I didn't
use that expression properly.@0003
Oh well. Anyway, it's really
embarrassing! That's what I meant.@0003
@000C@0017I'm very sorry.
I didn't know.@0003
@0009@0017Hmm... Well, I guess what's done
is done.@0003
Now that you've seen my dance, you
might as well tell me what you think!@0003
So what did you think?@0003
@000C@0017Uhm... It was really pretty.@0003
And very...stimulating.@0003
@0009@0017Do you think so?@0003
I still haven't worked out the
main part yet.@0003
It gets really amazing towards
the end.@0003
@000C@0017Wow... It does?@0003
@0009@0017Hey!@0003
Don't get any funny ideas
about what that means!@0003
@000C@0017W-what?!
I wasn't!@0003
[040C]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0116@0009Hmm...@0003
@000C@0017Oh, Larum.@0003
@0009Huh?@0003
Oh, you're that guy
who was spying on me.@0003
@000C...Not exactly...@0003
@0009@0017Well, you praised my dancing,
so I'll forgive you.@0003
@000CYou really like to dance,
don't you?@0003
@0009I guess. It's fun.@0003
I meet a lot of people when
I travel around,@0003
and they all love my dancing.
That's what I like.@0003
@000CI can understand that.@0003
@0009Hey, I know.@0003
Do you want me to show you the
rest of my dance from before?@0003
@000C@0017R-really?@0003
@0009@0017Do you want to see it?
You do, don't you?@0003
Tell me you want to see it.@0003
@000CI...I want to see it.@0003
@0009Then sure, I guess I can
show it to you!@0003
This is the sixth of the seven
dances I've mastered so far.@0003
And it's called...@0003
@000CYes...?@0003
@0009Dance Number 6.@0003
@000COh. That's kind of...boring.@0003
@0009@0017Hey!@0003
Is that an insult?@0003
@000CN-no!
By no means.@0003
@0009Yes, it was!@0003
@000CNo, it wasn't!@0003
@0009Yeah, whatever!@0003
Sorry, I changed my mind.
I won't show you my dance anymore!@0003
@000CAw, man...@0003
[040D]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0116
@000CLarum!@0003
@0009What?@0003
Oh, I know.@0003
You just want to see
that dance, right?@0003
@000CYour dancing...@0003
I think I've seen it
somewhere before.@0003
@0009Huh? You have?@0003
@000CYeah.@0003
A small band of entertainers stopped
by my village once when I was younger.@0003
I went to watch them...and a little
girl was dancing in the center.@0003
She tripped a few times, but I could
tell she was trying really hard.@0003
I was going through some tough
times back then,@0003
but that girl's dancing really
cheered me up.@0003
@0009@0017Hm...@0003
I don't remember.@0003
@000C@0017I didn't think so.
But it was really nice.@0003
I'm sure you cheer people up with
your dancing wherever you go.@0003
@0009Oh, you're embarrassing me now!
But thanks, Ogier.@0003
Tell you what.@0003
I'll show you one of my
special dances some time.@0003
@000CSpecial dances...?@0003
@0009They're really amazing!@0003
@000C@0017I...I bet.@0003
@0009@0017Hey!@0003
You were getting funny ideas
again, weren't you?@0003
@000C@0017N-no!
I wasn't!@0003
[040E]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0117@0009
Oh... Hello, Garret.@0003
@000C@0017You.@0003
I'm gonna be frank.
I don't wanna be your friend.@0003
...Wait.@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000CYou had an expensive-lookin'
bracelet on your wrist before.@0003
Where'd it go?@0003
@0009@0017...You have keen eyes.@0003
@000C@0017Well, you hafta when
you're a raider like me.@0003
Didja take it off or
somethin'?@0003
@0009@0017I gave it away.@0003
@000C@0017Huh?
You gave it away?@0003
@0009@0017I met an old blind man on the
way here.@0003
He said that he was starving,
so I gave it to him...@0003
@000C@0017Oh, brother! You nobles
are so gullible!@0003
He obviously tricked you.@0003
He made you pity him so
you'd give him money.@0003
@0009@0017But...what if he was
telling the truth...?@0003
@000CListen kid, there's no way
he was tellin' the truth.@0003
He was laughin' at ya as
soon as ya walked away.@0003
You're soft. You don't
know the real world.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
But...@0003
@000CEr... It was your bracelet,
though, so whatever...@0003
Do what ya want with
your own things...@0003
[040F]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0117@0009Hello, Garret.@0003
@000C@0017You again?@0003
I told you before, I ain't
your friend.@0003
There's no tellin' what'll happen
to you if you stick around me.@0003
@0009@0017I'll be fine.
You're a good person.@0003
@000C@0017Ha! Wouldja listen to that!@0003
You think you can tell good
from bad?@0003
After you were tricked so
easily the other day?@0003
@0009...But...@0003
@000CI'm here for the money.@0003
If I don't get paid, I'll just
go back to bein' a bandit.@0003
@0009...Why don't you just
rob me right now, then?@0003
@000C...What?@0003
@0009@0017I have magic tomes, jewelry...
A lot of expensive items.@0003
You can sell it for money.
Nobody would see you...@0003
Why don't you just take all
my belongings and run off?@0003
@000C@0017...Why are you even talkin' to me
if you know I can do that?@0003
What if I really did it?@0003
@0009@0017Then...I suppose I'm a fool.
But I don't think you would.@0003
I can sense that you're not
a bad person.@0003
I...trust you.@0003@0011
@000C...Arrgh!@0003
@0017How could I rob her when she
looks at me like that...?@0003
[0410]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0117@0009Hello, Garret.@0003
@000C@0017Hey...
Uh...@0003
@0009@0017Yes?@0003
@000CYou said you gave your bracelet
to some blind guy, right?@0003
@0017What would you do if you met
him again?@0003
@0009Well...@0003
@000CWhat's the point in even askin'?
I already know what'd happen.@0003
You'd get tricked just like before.
You'd give him anything he wanted.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Why do you care so much
for total strangers?@0003
What do you get from
helpin' 'em?@0003
Just ignore 'em.
Who cares?@0003
@0009...When I see people in need,
I feel I need to help them.@0003
If I met that blind man again,@0003
I'd probably give him something...
just like before.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
...Oh well. I guess some
people are just born stupid.@0003@0002
Oh yeah... Take this.@0003
@0009@0017What is this for?@0003
Such a beautiful
bracelet...@0003
@000C@0017I dunno.@0003
Some old guy came up to me the other
day and said he'd met you.@0003
He asked me to give it to you.@0003
He said that he was really
grateful for everything.@0003
@0009But...I met that
old man way back in--@0003
@000CN-not like I'd know!@0003
Anyway, he wanted me to give
it to you. Just take it.@0003@0011
@0009Garret...@0003
[0411]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@0117@000C@0017Hey, you're a
sailor, right?@0003
@0009Hm? Yeah, I am.@0003
@000CD'you make a lotta
money as a sailor?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
Well, I used to.
But now...not so much.@0003
I've had to stoop
to piracy.@0003
@000COh... Never mind then.@0003
@0009What? Did you
want something?@0003
@000CI was hopin' you might hire
me to work on your ship,@0003
but what's the point of goin'
from a bandit to a pirate?@0003
I...don't wanna rob for a
livin' anymore...@0003
@0009@0017Hey, not so fast.
I'm gonna quit piracy.@0003
It doesn't suit me anyway.@0003
I'm going back to being a
trader after the war ends.@0003
I could hire you to do odd jobs
around the ship if you want.@0003
[0412]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@0117
@0009@0017Hey, Garret.@0003
Try spinning around
a few times.@0003
@000CWhat? Are you jokin'?@0003
@0009Just think of it as
a sailor's test.@0003
@000C@0017Grr. Fine.@0003
@0016.........@0003@0016
All right, done.@0003
@0009Good.@0003
Now try walking
over here.@0003
@000C@0016......@0080@000D@0003
@0016...Whoa.@0080@000D@0003
@0009Yeah, you're gonna get
seasick.@0003
You'll have to fix that if
you want to be a sailor.@0003
@000BWhat? A grown man, seasick?@0003
@0009Age doesn't make any difference.@0003
I've seen plenty of grown men
puke their guts out.@0003
The outer seas can be
especially nasty.@0003
We sometimes come across storms
that could flip a ship over.@0003
Well, everyone gets used to it
after a month or so.@0003
@000BA month?@0003
I'm gonna be seasick for a
whole month?@0003
But it's not like we'll be at
sea the whole time, right?@0003
@0009Of course we will.
The ocean's huge.@0003
We sometimes don't even see
land for an entire year.@0003
@000BWhoa...@0003
Maybe I don't wanna do
this after all.@0003
[0413]
@0009@0010@0135@000C@0010@0117@000C@0017Fast cash isn't easy to
find, is it?@0003
Sailing sounds worse
the more I hear about it.@0003
@0009@0017You think so?
The sea's wonderful.@0003
@000C@0017But it's all water, right?@0003
It's just blue, blue,
blue wherever you look.@0003
@0009@0017No, the sea's not only blue.
Sometimes it turns gold.@0003
@000C@0017Huh?@0003
@0009@0017It's true.@0003
When the sun rises in the east...
or when it sets in the west...@0003
The whole ocean is illuminated
into a beautiful gold...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I prefer sunset over dawn
personally, though.@0003
There's nothing like sailing
into the setting sun...@0003
@000C@0017But you can't make any
money with a sunset.@0003
@0009...You have no sense for majesty.@0003
@0017Tell you what. I'll let you on my
ship sometime.@0003
Once you see that beauty, you'll
understand what it is to be a sailor.@0003
@000CBut it won't put bread
on the table...@0003
[0414]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0117@0009@0017Eeeeeeek!
A bandit!@0003
@000CYep, I'm a bandit.
I won't hurtcha though.@0003
...Actually, I was wonderin'...
Do performers make good money?@0003
@0009@0017Huh?@0003
@000C@0017I can't be a bandit forever.@0003
I'm lookin' for a new line of work
that'll put food on the table.@0003
@0009@0017Hmm...@0003
I'm not sure I'd say we
make GOOD money, but...@0003
@000C@0017D'you think there's any kinda
performance I could do?@0003
@0009@0017Well, I don't know...
All I know is dancing, really...@0003
I might have a dance you could
do, though...@0003
@000C@0017Really?
Teach me!@0003
@0009@0017Well...
All right.@0003
Next time.
See you!@0003@0011
@000C@0017I'm countin' on ya...@0003
[0415]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0117@0009No, no! You've got
it all wrong!@0003
@000C@0017W-what?
It's like this, right?@0003
Step like this, and
then twirl...@0003
Am I doin'
somethin' wrong?@0003
@0009Just doing the moves isn't enough.
You have to have charm.@0003
With an expression like that
you'll send everyone running.@0003
@000CYeah, well, this is my face.
I can't do anything about it!@0003
@0009Oh...?
Talking back, are we?@0003
Fine, I guess you don't want
me to teach you after all.@0003
@000CErgh... O-OK, I got it...
Charm, right?@0003
@0009@0017You have to smile constantly.@0003
Come on, give it a try.
Let's see a smile...@0003
@000C@0017S-smile...
All right...@0003@0002@0017
Cheeeeeeeese...@0003
@0009Ha ha ha ha ha!@0003
@000C@0017What're you laughin' at?!@0003
@0009@0017OK, let's see,
what else...?@0003
@0017Oh, I know.@0003
You need to use
your hips more.@0003
@000CM-my hips?! Look, I'm a big,
scary guy.@0003
Movin' my hips more'll
just make me look stupid!@0003
@0009@0017Oh...? Talking
back again?@0003
@000C@0017All right, all right!
I'll do it.@0003
I'll do anything you say!
Here... How's this?@0003
Am I movin' my hips
enough now?!@0003
@0009@0017Good!
That's perfect.@0003
Pfffha ha ha ha ha!@0003
@000C@0017...I swear, you're just
playin' with me...@0003
[0416]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0117@000C@0017Hey!
Larum!@0003
@0009@0017Yeah?@0003
@000C@0017You made a fool of me!@0003
You were teachin' me how
to dance, huh?@0003
It was nothin' but a
loada manure!@0003
When I danced for the others
like you showed me,@0003
they all laughed at me like
I was some kinda idiot!@0003
@0009@0017Really?
Good!@0003
@000C@0017What?!
Why, you...!@0003
@0009@0017Look. A performer's job is
to entertain.@0003
No matter how well you dance, it's
pointless if your audience is bored.@0003
@000CHm...@0003
@0009If you want your audience to cry, you
have to shed tears.@0003
And if you want them to laugh, you
might have to look stupid.@0003
If the audience is having fun, I never
hesitate to make a fool of myself.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
Slap me sideways.
You got a point...@0003
...I don't think dancin'
is for me, though.@0003
It's a lot harder than
I thought.@0003
@0009Ha ha ha...@0003
I thought you were
doing great.@0003
[0417]
@0009@0010@0117@000C@0010@012C@000C@0017Hey, you.@0003
@0009Yeah?@0003
@000CYou... You're
a bandit.@0003
@0009Hrngh? Yeah, I am.@0003
And you... You're a thief?
Hey, do thieves make decent--@0003
@000CShut up!
Stay away from me!@0003
@0009What?!@0003
@000CI hate bandits!@0003
I wanna rip my eyes out
whenever I see them!@0003
@0009Oh yeah? D'you think I care?@0003
Is that all you wanted to say?
You must be bored outta your mind.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016@0011
@0009...Huh. What was
that all about?@0003
[0418]
@0009@0010@0117@000C@0010@012C@0009@0017Hm?@0003
@000C...Oh.@0003
@0009Ugh.
You again?@0003
@000COh, great. A bandit.
My day is ruined now.@0003
@0009Heh.@0003
Like you're any different
from me. You steal too.@0003
You ain't got any right
to criticize me.@0003
@000CHah, I only steal
from the rich.@0003
@0009Oh, so we're playin' the
the good thief, are we?@0003
That doesn't justify--@0003
@000CMaybe not. I steal.
There's no denying that.@0003
But...I'd never, ever burn down a
village or hurt innocent people.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016...I...
I'm sorry.@0003@0011
[0419]
@0009@0010@0117@000C@0010@012C@0009@0017Hm?@0003
@000C...Oh.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016You again?
Urgh.@0003
@0009Hey, wait.@0003
@000CWhat do you want?!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016I'm a bandit. You're right.@0003
I've plundered villages and
hurt innocent people.@0003
But...lemme say just
one thing.@0003
@000CWhat could you possibly--?@0003
@0009I...I hate bandits, too...@0003
And I hate myself for livin'
like one.@0003
That's all.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017...Maybe you're not such
a bad guy after all.@0003
[041A]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0117@000C@0017Whoa?!@0003
@0009Uh? Wha?@0003
@000CWhat the...?!
You an enemy?@0003
@0009I...I...
I Gonzalez.@0003
@000CI wasn't askin' your name. I guess
you ain't an enemy, though.@0003
@0009I Gonzalez.@0003
@000C...How'd they letchoo
into this army anyway?@0003
You're like the exact
opposite of me.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I mean, look at what yer wearin'!
You look like a total brigand.@0003
People'll run at the first sight
of ya.@0003
@0009......@0003
@000C@0017I think you could
learn from me.@0003
@0009@0017Learn?
You?@0003
@000C...What? You got a
problem with that?@0003
@0009N-no...@0003
OK. I learn you.@0003
@000C@0017I'm Professor Garret.
Got that?@0003
@0009@0017P...
P...?@0003
Strange name...@0003
@000CLook who's talkin'!@0003
[041B]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0117@000CHey. You want
somethin'?@0003
@0009@0017You...
P...P...@0003
G...?@0003
@000C@0017Professor Garret.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah... You that.
Here. I give you.@0003
@000C@0017Hey! Guess you ain't
so useless after all.@0003
@0009@0017You like?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, my mom used to pick these in
the mountains when I was a kid.@0003
The bittersweet seeds are the
best part!@0003
@0009@0017Mom...
You have parents.@0003
I not have...@0003
@000CNot anymore I don't.@0003
My mom was killed in a bandit
attack when I was younger.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I survived, though.@0003
I hunted down every single one of
those bandits and made them pay.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016It took me eight years.@0003@0002
And now...I got nothin'
to show for it.@0003
I just...got nothin'
else to live for.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Grr... Why am I tellin'
this to you anyway?@0003
[041C]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0117@000CHey, Gonzalez.@0003
@0009@0017You...
P...@0003
@000C@0017Professor Garret.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah... You that.@0003
Here.
I give you.@0003
@000C@0017Whoa, you kiddin'...?@0003
You didn't have to bring
the whole tree with you.@0003
@0009@0017You like this.@0003
@000C@0017Well, yeah, but this is goin'
a little overboard...@0003
Ah, who cares. Thanks.
You want some?@0003
@0009@0017No. I not eat
strange things.@0003
@000C...What's that
supposed to mean?@0003
Hm?@0003
...Looks like we better get goin'.
Come on, Gonzalez.@0003
@0017Let's go.@0003
@0009Yeah.@0003
[041D]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0118@0009@0017You!
Wait!@0003
@000CYou...@0003
You must be a pegasus
knight from Ilia.@0003
Pleased to meet you. I am
Alen, knight of Pherae.@0003
@0009I'm Thea. But listen,
do you always--@0003
@000C@0017So this is a pegasus?
I've never seen one up close.@0003
Its face is so cute.@0003
@0009@0017Wow, thank you...
I mean, let me finish!@0003
Do you always
fight like that?@0003
@000C@0017So what if I do?@0003
@0009@0017Don't you think you're too rash?@0003
If you fight that way you can't
be sure you'll come out alive.@0003
@000CI know my fighting style
can be dangerous.@0003
But, you see...@0003@0002
Oh, chatting like this will
give the enemy an advantage.@0003
I must be alert. Farewell.@0003@0011
@0009...There's something
wrong with him.@0003
[041E]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0118@0009@0017Wait!
Wait!@0003
@000CThea? Is something wrong?@0003
@0009Please, tell me. Why do
you fight like that?@0003
Your lanceplay leaves
you open...@0003
Why do you rely on brute
strength to attack?@0003
You won't be able to retaliate
properly that way.@0003
@000CYou've been watching
me, haven't you?@0003
@0009Huh? N-no...
Not you in particular!@0003
It's just that...@0003
I can't ignore you when
you fight like that.@0003
That's all. Really.@0003
@000C@0016What?@0003@0016
@0009Anyway, the point is, you should
fight more cautiously.@0003
@000CI understand your concern.
But I can't hold back.@0003
@0009But if you keep fighting
like that, you'll--@0003
@000CIn battle, the first to match blades
with the enemy are us. The knights.@0003
The enemy will judge the entire army
by looking at how we fight.@0003
That's why I have to show them my
full power.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016The slightest recoil will signal to
the enemy that we can be defeated.@0003
And what's more, my fellow knights
will see and may hesitate...@0003
That's why I charge ahead.@0003
I have to keep pushing forward.
For the army. For victory.@0003
@0009...That makes sense.@0003
...And here I thought you were
just a careless idiot...@0003
@000CDid you say something
just now?@0003
@0009...No, nothing.@0003
@000CI'm sorry, but I have
to fight like this.@0003
Still, I respect your
advice.@0003
Tell me more when you
have a chance.@0003
@0009...Very well,
I suppose.@0003
[041F]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0118@0009@0017...You haven't changed your
fighting style, I see.@0003
@000CThea.@0003
@0009How long will you continue
fighting like that?@0003
I understand why you do...but if
you perish, that's the end.@0003
@000CI know that well.@0003
There is only so much
I can do on my own.@0003
But I am a knight,
so it is my duty...@0003
@0009@0017If that's the case...then will
you allow me to stay by you?@0003
@000C@0017Why...?@0003
@0009@0017If...if I leave you on your own,
I worry and...I can't focus!@0003
So I want to support you by
staying close.@0003
Or...am I not good enough
for you...?@0003
@000C@0017Of course you are!@0003
You're strong, you can keep up
with my horse, and...@0003
With you around, it seems that
I always come out unharmed.@0003
I can trust you to guard my back.@0003
@0009@0017Really?
You'll take me?@0003
@000COf course! You're a
strong warrior.@0003
I couldn't ask for a
better partner.@0003
@0009@0017That...that's not
what I meant...@0003
@000CI'm sorry?@0003
@0009I mean...the point is...we'll be
together...and, I mean...@0003
@000CI don't understand.@0003
@0009...Never mind. Forget it...@0003
Well, come on, then. Let's go.
The battle awaits us.@0003
@000CYes, we ride together!@0003
[0420]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0118@000C@0017Where's the next enemy...?@0003
@0009Alen.@0003
@000COh, Sir Marcus.@0003
@0009You have been performing
well lately.@0003
@000CThank you, sir.@0003
@0009However, you tend to charge
headfirst into enemy lines.@0003
Your duty is to protect
Lord Roy. You must think more.@0003
@000C@0017Think more...? What's
there to think about?@0003
Defeating the enemy
protects Lord Roy!@0003
@0009@0017What if an enemy made it past
you and Lord Roy was hurt?@0003
You wouldn't be able to make
it back to save him.@0003
@000CThat's never happened...@0003
@0009But you cannot deny that
it is a possibility.@0003
@000CWhat must I do?@0003
@0009Take your time in battle.@0003
@000CTake my time...?@0003
[0421]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0118@000C@0017Sir Marcus.@0003
@0009Alen.
What's troubling you?@0003
@000CI need your guidance...@0003
@0009My guidance?@0003
@000CYou told me to take my time
in battle.@0003
Does that mean I've been fighting
wrong this whole time?@0003
@0009Not at all.@0003
But you only know one
way of fighting.@0003
@000CThere's more than
one way...?@0003
@0009Your courage is not a bad trait.
Indeed, it is praiseworthy.@0003
I'm simply concerned you may leave
Lord Roy to fend for himself.@0003
@000CYou're right...@0003
@0009A knight must consider each
situation and adapt accordingly.@0003
Charging ahead is not always
the correct way.@0003
[0422]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0118@0009@0017Alen, your fighting
has improved.@0003
@000CThanks to you...@0003
I am trying to adapt my fighting
style to each situation.@0003
@0009Good.@0003
Hmm. You might be ready to
take over for me.@0003
@000CWhat do you mean?@0003
@0009I have grown old.@0003
I must make way for
the new generation.@0003
I trust Lord Roy will be
safe in your hands.@0003
@000CM-me...?@0003
@0009Are you embarrassed to take
the place of an old man?@0003
@000C@0017Of course not!
It would be an honor!@0003
I shall protect Lord Roy with my
life and Pherae will prosper--@0003
@0009@0017Calm yourself. Your passion
is all that worries me.@0003
@000CYes, you're right...@0003
@0009Just try to control your emotions.
Lord Roy is still young.@0003
You must grow with him. As a
knight, and as a person.@0003
[0423]
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@0119@0009@0017Lance!
How fares your sword today?@0003
@000C@0017Neither good nor bad,
Alen.@0003
@0009...Cool and calm as always,
I see.@0003
@0017I may have lagged behind you the
other day, but not in this battle!@0003
Watch and learn from my skill,
Lance!@0003
@000C@0017Of course I'll watch. We can all
learn from one another.@0003
Don't expect me to lower myself
to your level, though.@0003
@0009Well, look at you!@0003
I look forward to sparring
when the battle's done.@0003
I'll be off then.
You'd better hurry along too.@0003
[0424]
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@0119@000C@0017Alen, the battles will only get
more difficult from here on.@0003
@0009@0017I know, but a challenge
is just what I want.@0003
@000C@0017I have something to
request of you. If we lose.@0003
@0009If we lose?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
...If it ever looks like defeat is certain,
I want you to take Lord Roy and retreat.@0003
I will act as a decoy for the enemy
and buy you time.@0003
@0009What?
But what about you?@0003
@000CIf it has to be one of us,
it may as well be me.@0003
I've served House Pherae the
shortest, so--@0003
@0009Have you lost your mind?!@0003
@000C...Alen?@0003
@0009If you're staying, then so will I.@0003
I won't allow you to run headfirst
into certain death alone.@0003
@000CBut you're one of a long line of
knights serving House Pherae.@0003
It's better that you take
Lord Roy and flee.@0003
@0009How long you've served means nothing!
Let me ask you this.@0003
Do you consider yourself any less
loyal than the other knights?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016No answer? Then allow me.@0003
You're just as valuable as any of us!@0003
You've held to your knightly
vows admirably!@0003
I've been your partner ever since you
came to House Pherae so I know that well!@0003
@000CAlen...@0003
@0009Don't throw your life away, Lance.
Lord Roy needs you. We all do.@0003
[0425]
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@0119@000C@0017Alen, about before...@0003
@0009You mean about if we lose?@0003
Still intending to sacrifice yourself?
Or something even more ludicrous?@0003
@000CNo, you're right.
Your words were a slap in the face.@0003
Perhaps I was belittling myself because
I've served House Pherae the shortest.@0003
@0009Your work is second to none.@0003
Well, second to mine,
but that's a given.@0003
@000CWhere does your confidence come from?
I envy you sometimes.@0003
@0009I'm confident simply because I know
I could never lose to you.@0003
@000C...I'll make you eat those words
after I beat you today.@0003
@0009Hah, not likely!@0003
See you after the battle!@0003
@000COf course.@0003
@0009@0017And Lance?@0003
@000CYes?@0003
@0009Even if we lose, you won't be
left behind! Remember that!@0003
@000COf course!@0003
[0426]
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@011E@0009@0017You...@0003
You're Ward,
the mercenary.@0003
@000CUh, yeah...
Who are you?@0003
@0009I'm Alen, knight of Pherae.@0003
@000C@0017Oh, you're one of our
client's knights.@0003
Are you any good?@0003
@0009Right to the point...@0003
I will say that I consider
myself fairly skilled.@0003
@000CAll right, good.
Let's duel.@0003
@0009@0017What, right now?@0003
@000C@0017Of course.@0003
@0009Very well.@0003
But I'm telling you now,
I won't go easy on you.@0003
@000CI'd expect no less.@0003
Just don't start crying
if I hurt you.@0003
@0009@0017Let's go!@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0011@0007
@000C@0010@0118@0009@0010@011E
@0009W...whoa...
You're better than I thought...@0003
@000CYou too...
Good fight!@0003
@0009I'll beat you next time.
Got that?@0003
@000CSure thing!@0003
[0427]
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@011E@000CHey, you!@0003
@0009Ward!
How do you fare?@0003
@000CI've been looking for you.@0003
We didn't finish our
match yet.@0003
@0009@0017Oh? I thought I won.@0003
@000C@0017No way. I was just getting warmed up.
You haven't seen the real me yet.@0003
@0009@0017No?@0003
@0017You haven't seen what
I can do, either!@0003
@000CBring it on!@0003@0009@0011@000C@0011@0007
@000C@0010@0118@0009@0010@011E
@0009You are strong...@0003
@000CLet's call it a tie... Lance and
I used to spar like this a lot.@0003
It's great to have a partner
to train and grow with.@0003
@0009@0017I haven't lost yet!@0003
You'll see my true strength
next time, you hear?!@0003
@000C@0017Of course.
Any time you're ready!@0003
[0428]
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@011E@000C@0017Aaaarrr!@0003
@0009@0016...!@0003@0016
You're...getting better, Ward!@0003
@000CY...you too!@0003
You become stronger every
time we meet.@0003
@0009@0017I'm nothing.
It's just you who's weak.@0003
@000CHeh, whatever!
I'll beat you!@0003
I'll crush all the
enemies with my axe...@0003
@0009@0017Enemies...?@0003
Ward.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009What do you think
of this war?@0003
@000CWhat do you mean?@0003
@0009Do you think we can win?@0003
@000C@0017What?
Of course we'll win.@0003
I'm on this side, after all.
How could we lose?@0003
We've also got you.@0003
No one stands a chance
against the two of us.@0003
@0009Ha ha...
You're right.@0003
We can't lose.@0003
Enough talk!
Charge!@0003
@000CYeah!
Let's go get 'em!@0003
[0429]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0119@0009@0017Lance, have you gotten used
to serving House Pherae?@0003
@000CYes, Sir Marcus.@0003
Everyone has been very good to me despite
the fact that I'm an outsider...@0003
@0009I see.
That is good to hear.@0003
@000C@0017You have been very caring as
well, Sir Marcus.@0003
@0009Of course. I need
you especially.@0003
@000CReally?
Me?@0003
@0009You possess experiences the
other knights do not.@0003
@000CDo I...?@0003
@0009Yes, you do.@0003
Those traits will be of great help
to Lord Roy in the future.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
[042A]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0119@000C@0017Sir Marcus.@0003
@0009Yes, Lance?@0003
@000CYou said before that I had experiences
the other knights do not.@0003
@0009That I did.@0003
@000CI cannot see what those
experiences are.@0003
I am but a young knight.@0003
I think you see more in me
than there actually is.@0003
@0009I think not.@0003
@000CI will use what experience I have, but I
don't know that I can help especially.@0003
I served a different lord until just
recently, after all...@0003
@0009And that is it.@0003
@000CSorry?@0003
@0009That is the experience the
others do not have.@0003
@000COh...@0003
@0009Lord Roy will take the throne
of Pherae.@0003
If he is surrounded by only those
of Pherae, his views will lack scope.@0003
We need someone like you. You know
other parts of the world firsthand.@0003
@000CWill that experience...
really be of use?@0003
@0009You must make it so.@0003
Lord Roy must grow into an
individual with global views.@0003
[042B]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0119@0009Lance.@0003
@000C@0017Ah, Sir Marcus.@0003
@0009@0017Lord Roy said that you told him
stories of other lands.@0003
@000CIf my experience can be of use to Lord
Roy, then I will do my best to teach him.@0003
@0009Very good.@0003
Then it seems that I can
retire with no worries.@0003
@000C@0017Sir Marcus, what are you saying?
We still have much to learn from you.@0003
@0009Not if we have you.@0003
You can take my place once
I am gone.@0003
@000CMe? But I'm not even
a native of Pherae...@0003
@0009Are you still worrying
yourself over that?@0003
Lord Roy certainly isn't.@0003
@000C...Very well. If you wish it, I shall
take your place when the time comes.@0003
But that won't happen for
many years.@0003
You are still well. You are an
example to us all.@0003
@0009Perhaps. But we all must
step down eventually.@0003
[042C]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@011F@0009@0017You are Lot the mercenary.
An axe-fighter of great endurance.@0003
@000CYou... You're Lance,
knight of Pherae.@0003
@0009Is something troubling you?
You have a worried look about you.@0003
@000COh... I was just thinking
about something.@0003
Actually, this is perfect. Let me
ask your opinion on something.@0003
@0009If it is within my meager
scope of knowledge.@0003
@000CAll right, so, axes are
weak against swords.@0003
That much is common sense.@0003
What I'm wondering is why it's
that way to begin with.@0003
I don't understand the
physics behind it.@0003
That's what's troubling me.@0003
@0009I see. I wondered the same
thing before.@0003
I found the answer after going
through several books on tactics.@0003
@000CIs it...the
weapon's weight?@0003
@0009Exactly.@0003
All weapons are designed by
humans.@0003
As such, an invincible weapon
with no flaws is inconceivable.@0003
@000CYou're saying a weapon will
always have weaknesses.@0003
@0009Right.@0003
Throughout history, many kinds of
weapons have been made,@0003
and the vast majority of them 
have fallen out of use.@0003
Of all of them, the sword, axe and lance
remain, creating the weapon triangle.@0003
@000CBut what about weapons like
the swordreaver?@0003
@0009Well, that brings us to a
whole new dimension.@0003
What I mean is... ............@0003
@000C...Ah, I see...
Then what about... ............@0003
[042D]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@011F@0009@0017Knight to F6.@0003
@000CKnight to E3.@0003
@0009Pegasus knight to D1.@0003
@000CEr...@0003
Archer to B1.@0003
@0009Swordmaster to F1.@0003
Checkmate.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016...You win.@0003
@0009So it seems.@0003
@000C...Do you think it was a mistake
to move that ballista 6 turns ago?@0003
@0009Yes, I think so.@0003
Where did you learn how to play?@0003
It's a requirement for knights,
so that's how I learned it.@0003
@000CAn old war veteran who lives
close to my home taught me.@0003
I could never find anyone to play
against in my mercenary groups.@0003
It looks like I'm but a novice
next to you, though.@0003
@0009Well, you can recognize your own
mistakes, so you have skill.@0003
I played with Alen the other day,
but it was over in 2 turns.@0003
[042E]
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@011F@000C@0017What do you think
of this battle?@0003
@0009What do you mean?@0003
@000CDo you think we stand
a chance of winning?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016I honestly don't know.
We are severely outnumbered.@0003
The enemy can afford to send in new
troops all the time,@0003
while we must be careful not to
lose even a single soldier.@0003
@000CYeah... We're almost on
completely different levels.@0003
@0009But Lord Roy often conceives genius
strategies beyond my understanding.@0003
He has commanded us miraculously
well thus far.@0003
Under his direction, I feel that
we cannot fail.@0003
Lord Roy will surely lead us to
a glorious victory.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
...You're not a yes man, thinking
so just because he is your lord.@0003
So if even you believe in him,
he deserves my faith...@0003
@0017I'm certain we will succeed.@0003
[042F]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@011A
@0009Perceval.@0003
@000C...Cecilia.
Have your wounds healed?@0003
@0009Yes, somehow.@0003
@000CGood.@0003
...I'm sorry. I was there,
but I couldn't come to your aid.@0003
@0009You did what you were supposed to.
Don't worry about it.@0003
@000CThank you...@0003
But it was a mistake
to follow Bern.@0003
I fight in this army to
atone for that mistake.@0003
@0009I'm sure you've done more
than your share already.@0003
[0430]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@0134@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000C@0017Is something wrong,
Perceval?@0003
@0009That village we just passed...
It was in ruins.@0003
@000C...Yes, it was.@0003
@0009Most of Elibe probably looks like
that now thanks to the war.@0003
@000CYes, probably...@0003
@0009We must put an end
to this conflict...@0003
We must defend those who
cannot defend themselves...@0003
@000CI agree.@0003
[0431]
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@0134@0009@0017Cecilia?
You look troubled.@0003
@000CPerceval...@0003
I was just wondering what might
become of Etruria after all this...@0003
@0009That is very much like you.
Always dutiful and loyal.@0003
...But I think there is only
one answer to that question.@0003
@000CAnd what's that?@0003
@0009Etruria will regain its
former glory.@0003
It will become more prosperous
than ever before.@0003
@000C...Do you think so?@0003
@0009Of course.@0003
We will make it happen
with our own hands.@0003
@000CYes...@0003
@0009You mustn't lose hope, Cecilia.@0003
If the Etrurian Generals give up,
then who will rebuild our country?@0003
@000C@0017Yes...
You're right, Perceval.@0003
[0432]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@011A@0009Lord Perceval, if I may have
a moment of your time...@0003
@000C@0017Your Highness...!@0003
You need not address
me with a title...@0003
@0009Hush!@0003
We can never know where
enemies may be hiding.@0003
Here, I am but a
simple bard. Understood?@0003
@000CYes, fully.@0003
...What is it that
you need, Elffin?@0003
@0009@0017Prince Myrddin of Etruria passed
away last year.@0003
I'm curious about how the court
has been acting since then.@0003
@000C@0017...Very well.
I will tell you what I know.@0003
After Prince Myrddin
passed away...@0003
[0433]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@011A@000C@0017My Pr--
I mean, Elffin.@0003
@0009@0017What is it,
Lord Perceval?@0003
@000C@0017Your father is still alive.
Have you seen him recently?@0003
@0009@0017No, I have not seen him
in over a year.@0003
@000C@0017Have you no intention of
seeing him at all?@0003
@0009@0017Not until this war ends.@0003
@000C@0017Why?@0003
Your father mourns for you,
thinking you long dead.@0003
@0009@0017If I let my father know of my safety,
other people will find out as well.@0003
My father may be happy for a brief
moment,@0003
but he would soon suffer the grief
of losing me again.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I must eliminate the root
of that grief.@0003
Only then will I go to see
my father.@0003
[0434]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@011A@000C@0017Elffin.@0003
You were talking about songs
for your future travels...@0003
@0009@0017The songs about the state of Etruria
since the passing of the prince?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, those.@0003
Will you sing them all across the
continent when the war ends?@0003
@0009@0017That is my intention, yes.@0003
I travel not only to sing,
but to learn as well.@0003
@000C@0017...Will you be visiting the
Etrurian palace?@0003
@0009@0017Yes, of course I will.@0003
I expect my stay in Etruria
to be the longest of all.@0003
@000C@0017And where will you go after
you visit the palace?@0003
@0009@0017Nowhere...@0003
I intend to stay and sing for the
Kingdom of Etruria until my death.@0003
@000C@0017...Have I your word?@0003
@0009@0017I swear on my honor.@0003
[0435]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@011A@0009General Perceval.@0003
@000C@0017You're...Larum,
if I recall correctly.@0003
@0009@0017Look, look!@0003
@0009Watch me dance!@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Well?
How was it?@0003
Did it grasp you?@0003
I think this twirl
really does the trick...@0003
What do you think?@0003
@000C@0017...Are you always like that?@0003
@0009@0017Like what?@0003
@000C@0017So carefree...@0003
Or should I say...
disoriented?@0003
@0009@0017Aww...
Thanks!@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
[0436]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@011A@0009What did you think this time,
General Perceval?@0003
@000C@0017...Larum.
I was wondering...@0003
Why do you always show
me your dancing?@0003
@0009@0017Why?@0003
@0009Don't you enjoy seeing
me dance?@0003
@000C@0017To be perfectly honest...@0003
@0009@0017Yes?@0003
@000C@0017I don't care for it.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
......@0003@0016
...You don't care
for it...?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009You...@0003
You cruel, cruel man!
I never want to see you again!@0003@0011
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
[0437]
@000C@0010@011A@000C@0016...... ......@0003
...... ......@0003
...... ......@0003@0002
@0016@0017...Odd...@0003
She was nothing but a nuisance,
but now that she's gone, I...@0003
@0009@0010@0126@0017...Feel lonely?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Really?
I knew it!@0003
I knew you liked
having me around!@0003
@000C@0017...I didn't say that.@0003
@0009@0017Don't lie.@0003
You said you felt
lonely without me.@0003
@000C@0017...No, actually,
I didn't say that.@0003
@0009@0017I knew it, I knew it!@0003
Not even General Perceval can live
without my dancing.@0003
I'll come to your quarters and give
you wake-up dances every morning!@0003
@000C@0017...You seem to be beyond
my comprehension.@0003
[0438]
@0009@0010@012D@000C@0010@011B@000CSophia, are you all right?@0003
@0009@0017...Oh...
Igrene... Yes...@0003
I'm fine...
I'm just a little dizzy...@0003
@000C@0017Don't work yourself too hard
if you're not feeling well.@0003
@0009@0017Yes, I know...@0003
The outside world...
is so vast...@0003
It's enough...
to excite me a bit...@0003
@000C@0017Yes, you've never seen civilization
outside of Arcadia like this.@0003
Ask me if you have any questions...@0003
I know the outside world fairly well,
so I can explain things for you.@0003
@0009@0017Yes, thank you...@0003
[0439]
@0009@0010@012D@000C@0010@011B@0009@0017Igrene...@0003
@000C@0017Yes?@0003
@0009@0017Um... What is this?
I found it...on the ground...@0003
@000C@0017Let's see...@0003
Oh, this is a quarrel.@0003
@0009A what...?@0003
@000CQuarrels are large arrows
used in ballistae.@0003
@0009@0017They fire these...?
They're so big....@0003
But...it's strange...@0003
@000C@0017What is?@0003
@0009@0017The people living outside...@0003
They make such amazing creations...
and they are so advanced...@0003
And yet...why do they continue
to fight?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016They're...much smarter than us,
so...@0003
one would think they would know...
that war is pointless...@0003
...It is puzzling...@0003
@000CYes...@0003
You're right.
It is strange...@0003
[043A]
@0009@0010@012D@000C@0010@011B@000C@0017Oh?@0003
You seem to be in
a good mood, Sophia.@0003
@0009@0017Yes...@0003
I was speaking...to the other
people in the army...@0003
The people living outside...
are all so kind...@0003
@000C@0017That's nice.@0003
@0009@0017I would like...if we could be
friends...with the outsiders...@0003
@000CMe too...@0003
But the elder forbids
contact with outsiders.@0003
@0009Yes, I know...@0003
@000CI can understand why, though...@0003
The dragons' power could easily
destroy entire countries.@0003
If the outsiders learn of their existence,
they will surely fight over them.@0003
I've seen many conflicts like that
in my life...@0003
@0009Yes... But...
perhaps someday...@0003
@000CMaybe so...@0003
If we in Arcadia can live
together with dragons,@0003
there's no reason outsiders
can't learn to do the same...@0003
[043B]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@011B@000C@0017You...!@0003
@0009@0017Hm?@0003
@000C@0017I can't believe my
eyes...!@0003
Could it...could it
really be you?@0003
@0009@0017Sorry, what? I don't know
what you're talking about.@0003
I'm Astolfo. Just a
petty thief.@0003
@000C@0017...You look just like him...@0003
You look so much like...
my husband...@0003
@0009@0017Your husband?@0003
@000C@0017I lived with him in Arcadia.@0003
...But one day he left
without saying a word...@0003
@0009@0017Huh. And he looks exactly
like me?@0003
Well, they say everyone has an
exact double somewhere out there.@0003
Best you forget about it.@0003
@000C@0017Wait!
Let me see your leg.@0003
@0009Hey, whoa,
what're you doing?@0003
@000CI first found him
collapsed in the desert.@0003
The heat had gotten to him, and
he'd lost his memory.@0003
He had blade wounds all over
his body,@0003
but he had a particularly bad
injury on his leg.@0003
It never fully healed, and it
left a scar.@0003
@0009@0017Well, I'm not your man.@0003
My legs are clean. I don't have
any gross scars like that.@0003
I really have to get going.@0003
@000C@0017Oh...@0003
[043C]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@011B@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016@0017You again?@0003
@000CAre you...are you
really not him?@0003
@0009@0017No way. But hey, for what it's
worth, I can't believe that guy.@0003
Dumping a gorgeous gal like you.
What a chump.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017Please, let me tell
you about him.@0003
@0009@0017All right.
I can do that.@0003
@000C@0017His name was Gorlois.@0003
We started to live together as
I nursed him back to health.@0003
We lived happily for
several years.@0003
Slowly, his memory started
returning.@0003
I was happy, but also...scared.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016One day, bandits attacked Arcadia.@0003
Gorlois left to fight them off
but he never came back.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016The corpses of the bandits all sank
into the quicksand.@0003
I couldn't find Gorlois, so I
assumed the same happened to him.@0003
@0009Well, there you go.
There's your story.@0003
@000CI couldn't help but think in the bottom
of my heart that he might yet live.@0003
@0009Ah. Wishful thinking.@0003
@000CBut...if he were alive, he wouldn't
have disappeared without a word...@0003
@0009@0017He's probably living a pretty
miserable life now anyway.@0003
I say you forget about him
and move on.@0003
Hey, I know.@0003
I can give you a kiss in his place
if it'll make you feel better...@0003
@000C@0016!@0003@0016@0011
@0009Ow. She didn't have to slap me...
Sigh...@0003
[043D]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@011B@000C@0017Oh...@0003
@0009@0017It's you. The rejected man
will slink away now...@0003
@000C@0017Wait!
Gorlois...!@0003
...I mean, Astolfo.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Please, look at this...@0003
My husband had it when
I first met him.@0003
@0009@0017What is this doodle?@0003
@000C@0017
It's not a doodle.@0003
It's a seal given to
Lycian spies.@0003
I also did some research on
what kind of work they do...@0003
And...now I understand...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Spies carry information
dangerous to their enemies.@0003
If a spy is caught, the enemy
will exploit any weakness.@0003
Family and loved ones are
often taken hostage...@0003
And the spy is tortured until he
spills every bit of information.@0003
That's why a spy must be alone...@0003
He must have no family, friends,
or loved ones...@0003
@0009@0017...I'm sorry, but...
that guy is dead.@0003
He was devoured by the
quicksands of Nabata.@0003
All this stuff about spies...
It's just your imagination.@0003
Or maybe the desert heat made
you see things.@0003
@000C@0016@0017......@0003
@0016Yes... It must have
been a dream...@0003
A wonderful dream...@0003
@0009...Igrene.
...I...@0003@0002
Sorry, forget it.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016@0011@0006
@0009@0014Just...forget about me.
...Please.@0003
[043E]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0122@000CHello, Marcus.@0003
@0009@0017Ah, Lady Lilina.@0003
@000CThings grow more
perilous all the time...@0003
Marcus, do you think Roy
will be OK?@0003
@0009Of course, milady.@0003
Lord Roy takes after his father,
the greatest knight in Lycia.@0003
@000C@0017Yes... Lord Eliwood is a
great knight indeed.@0003
@0009@0017His wife was also a kind,
gentle woman.@0003
Much like yourself,
if I may say so.@0003
@000CWow...
Do you really think so?@0003
@0009Lord Roy is becoming very much
like his father.@0003
I expect him to seek a wife
much like Lord Eliwood's.@0003
@000CLike his mother...?@0003
@0009Milady, if you would allow me
a suggestion.@0003
When all is done and we return to
Lycia, you and Lord Roy should w--@0003
@000C@0017Marcus!@0003
Roy and I are friends.
Just friends!@0003
It's too soon to think
of marriage!@0003
[043F]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0122@000CMarcus, what kind of couple were
Lord Eliwood and his wife?@0003
@0009Well, milady, just looking at them
would fill one with cheer.@0003
The people of Pherae were truly
happy for them.@0003
@000CThat sounds nice...@0003
@0009Lord Eliwood loved his wife deeply.@0003
One night...before the two were
wed, Lord Eliwood disappeared.@0003
He returned three days later, and
presented his wife a flower.@0003
It was a beautiful white flower that
grows only in the snowy highlands.@0003
And it was the flower she loved
the most.@0003
@000CLord Eliwood sounds so...
romantic. Sigh...@0003@0002
@0017And look at Roy...@0003
[0440]
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0122@000C@0017Sigh...@0003
@0009What troubles you,
Lady Lilina?@0003
@000C@0017Marcus...@0003
What does...what does
Roy think of me?@0003
I...I'm not so
sure anymore.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Roy... He's...
I've always...liked him....@0003
@0009@0017Why not ask him yourself,
milady?@0003
@000CWhat...?
But...@0003
@0009I do not know much of these matters,@0003
but the maids in the castle say that
women can no longer be passive.@0003
I'm certain Lord Roy would fall
for you if you were to advance.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017Yes...
That's what I'll do.@0003
I've known him longer
than anyone.@0003
I won't let someone
else snatch him up!@0003
@0009That's the spirit,
Lady Lilina!@0003
[0441]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@0122@000CHello, Astolfo.@0003
@0009Well, if it isn't Lady Lilina.
Your beauty is a sight to behold.@0003
In fact, I think it's rubbing off
on me. My wrinkles are fading. See?@0003
@000CAstolfo...
You haven't changed at all.@0003
My father always said you'd be better
at your job if you were more serious.@0003
@0009You'll hear no arguments
from me, milady.@0003
@000C...By the way, how did you
meet my father?@0003
He never told me anything...@0003
@0009It really wasn't a meeting you'd
go around telling people about.@0003
@000CWhat does that mean?@0003
@0009...I was a petty thief back then.@0003
I decided to creep into Castle Ostia
to swipe some treasure, see.@0003
@000CReally?@0003
@0009Oh yeah.@0003
@000CWhat happened?@0003
@0009Well...@0003
...Whoops, we really shouldn't
be wasting time like this.@0003
Forgive me, milady, but I'll tell
you the story some other time.@0003
@000COh?
I guess I can wait...@0003
[0442]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@0122@0009...It was easy getting to
the treasure vault.@0003
I'm an expert at picking locks
and all that, after all.@0003
Once I'd grabbed all the goodies
and made my way out, bam!@0003
There was a man, standing right
in front of me.@0003
And wouldn't you know, that
man was--@0003
@000CMy father?@0003
@0009You got it. Lord Hector just
stood there, staring at me.@0003
He didn't seem angry
or anything.@0003
You could tell he was important
just by looking at him.@0003
Me? I was frozen on the spot, with
bags of loot over my shoulders.@0003
Would he call the guards?@0003
Would he cut me down right then
and there?@0003
My mind was racing, trying to
figure out what was coming up...@0003
@000CWhat happened?@0003
@0009He suddenly burst out
laughing, milady.@0003
"Quite a man to get through my
security so easily," he said.@0003
Then he asked my name. I was
speechless, mouth open.@0003
Lord Hector then offered me
the job of serving him.@0003
@000CWow...@0003
@0009I thought he was out of his mind.
But I could tell he was serious.@0003
Anyway, I wasn't up for it and ran
for the door with the treasure.@0003
And then...@0003
@000CAnd then?@0003
@0009And then Lord Hector...@0003
@000CWhat? What did he do?@0003
@0009He...@0003
@0017Whoops, sorry, milady,@0003
@0017I should really get going.
I'll finish the story later.@0003
@000CAgain?
Sigh...@0003
[0443]
@0009@0010@011D@000C@0010@0122
@0009Lord Hector...@0003
He didn't budge even when he
saw me start to run.@0003
So I made a mad dash.@0003
I was almost at the door, but Lord
Hector was still just standing there.@0003
I was confused, so I turned and
yelled at him,@0003
"I'm getting away with your treasure!
You're not going to do anything?!"@0003
A heavy voice responded. "Flee if you
wish. You have earned the treasure.@0003
But is that what you want in life?
To live in fear in the shadows?"@0003@0002
I ran like a madman, milady. I fled
from the castle, from his booming voice.@0003
I didn't know what to do with myself,
so I wandered around aimlessly all night.@0003
At the break of dawn...I found myself
back at the front of the castle.@0003@0002
And Lord Hector was there waiting
for me.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I worked for him ever
since, milady.@0003
He changed my life.@0003
@000C@0017So that's what happened...@0003
@0009Lady Lilina, I will never
be ashamed to say this.@0003
Your father...was the most
honorable man I've met.@0003
[0444]
@000C@0010@011E@0009@0010@0129@000C
So, who's next?!@0003
@0016...?@0003@0016@0017
Hey! Shanna!@0003
@0009@0017Hey, Ward.
What's wrong?@0003
@000C@0017
Don't buzz about the
front lines so much.@0003
@0009Buzz about?!
Am I an insect?!@0003
@000CYou might as well be! Archers sure
make short work of you!@0003
@0009Oh yeah?!@0003
Then you're an ape, you
stupid, slowpoke axefighter!@0003
You can't even dodge!@0003
@000CSay that again!@0003
You pickin' a
fight with me?!@0003
@0009You started it, you idiot!@0003
@0017But fine, you're on! Just try and
hit me all the way up here.@0003
@000C@0017Hey... Shanna!
No fair!@0003
Get down here!@0003
@0009@0017Yeah, right!
Catch me if you can!@0003@0011
@000C@0017Blast it!@0003
She really knows how
to set me off!@0003
[0445]
@000C@0010@011E@0009@0010@0129@0009Yaaawn...@0003
@000C@0017Too soon to relax,
stupid.@0003
@0009Ow!@0003
Hey! You hit me!@0003
What did you do
that for?@0003
@000CThere was an enemy archer
taking aim from the bushes.@0003
@0009What...?@0003
@000CAnd here you are,
yawning it up. Idiot.@0003
@0009Idiot?@0003
You have no right to call
anyone an idiot, let alone me!@0003
@000CI dunno, someone who decides to kick back
in a battle seems pretty idiotic to me.@0003
You're just lucky I happened to pass by.@0003
You'd be vulture food by now if
not for me.@0003
@0009Hmph, I can take care of a
single archer no problem.@0003
@0017Do you want a favor or something?
I don't need you watching my back.@0003
@000C@0017Oh, is that so!
Then pardon me!@0003
I'll just sit back and watch
you from now on, then.@0003
Good luck! Hope ya don't die!@0003@0011
@0009That idiot!@0003
I didn't even have a
chance to thank him...@0003
[0446]
@000C@0010@011E@0009@0010@0129@000C@0017Where did she go?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, Ward.@0003
What are you
doing here?@0003
@000C@0017
I told you to leave this
area to me.@0003
That means you don't go
flying around on your own!@0003
We have to follow Roy's
orders...@0003
@0009But if we sit around waiting for
orders all the time,@0003
we could miss an opportunity!@0003
@000CDon't you get it?!@0003
What if you flew out by yourself
into a bunch of enemy archers?!@0003
Why don't you just think before
you act...?@0003
@0009What?@0003
I thought you were angry about
me fighting without you.@0003
@000COf course I am!@0003
We need to work as
a team in battle...@0003
@0009Then what was all that about
the archers and stuff?@0003
@000CUh!@0003
Th-that was...@0003
@0009@0017...Were you worried about me?@0003
@000C@0017W-w-what are you talking about?!
N-n-no way!@0003
Y-you just don't know how to
act in battle...@0003
@0009Ward, you're stuttering.@0003
@000CErr...@0003
@0009@0017Ward.@0003
@000C@0017What?@0003
@0009@0017Thanks.@0003
@000C@0017...Oh, c'mon. You're not
supposed to say that.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah...
You're right.@0003
[0447]
@0009@0010@011E@000C@0010@011F@0009@0017All right, who's next!
Bring it on!@0003
@000C@0017Ward, can't you calm
down a bit?@0003
@0009@0017
What's that?
You scared, Lot?@0003
@000CNot likely!@0003
@0009@0017Then what's the problem?@0003
I rush in, and you do
everything else.@0003
That's worked great
so far.@0003
@000CYeah, but...@0003
@0009But what?@0003
@000CMary asked me to take
care of you.@0003
@0009My sister said that?
I'm not a kid anymore...@0003
@000CI wish that were true.@0003
@0009Did you say something?@0003
@000CNo, nothing.@0003
[0448]
@0009@0010@011E@000C@0010@011F@000CWard, you seem to be
doing well today.@0003
@0009Of course!
I'm always great.@0003
You better fight
hard, too, buddy.@0003
You need money to buy
medicine for your mother...@0003
@000C@0017...I don't need to
anymore.@0003
@0009Huh?@0003
What do you mean?@0003
@000CMy mother, she...@0003
She didn't make it.@0003
@0009What?!@0003
Why didn't you
tell me?!@0003
@000CBecause if I did, you'd tell
me to go home to Mieu.@0003
@0009@0017
No kidding!
She's all alone now.@0003
Don't you care about your
baby sister?@0003
@000C
But I got the message
during a job.@0003
I couldn't leave
without finishing.@0003
@0009...Lot?@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009You're stupider
than I thought.@0003
@000C...Maybe so.@0003
[0449]
@0009@0010@011E@000C@0010@011F@000C@0017Ward, you're acting
strangely as of late.@0003
Do you have something
to say to me?@0003
@0009...Lot.@0003
@000CYeah?@0003
@0009Don't die.@0003
Whatever you do,
don't die.@0003
@000CWhat...?@0003
@0009If you're killed,
what will happen to Mieu?@0003
She's just a little girl.
She'll be forced to live on her own.@0003
@000CBut you're no different.@0003
Mary would be devastated
if you were killed.@0003
@0009Oh, sure, like she
would cry over me.@0003
@000C...You can't honestly
think that.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016It's not just me that
can't die here.@0003
It's both of us.@0003
One day, we'll go
back home.@0003
@0009...It's just a dirty village with no
clean water or vegetation.@0003
@000CMaybe so, but it's our home, and we
both have people waiting for us.@0003
@0009Yeah, you're right.
Let's not disappoint them!@0003
[044A]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@011E@0009Hey, you're from the
Western Isles, aren't you?@0003
@000C@0017@0016......@0003@0016
How did you know?@0003
@0009@0017I can tell by your face.@0003
@000C@0017
Really? That's actually
kind of impressive...@0003
@0009@0017Are you going back to your
hometown after the war?@0003
If you are, I could use
your help.@0003
@000C@0017Help with what?@0003
@0009@0017I'm planning to build a new village for
people who lost their homes in the war.@0003
I can't do it myself, though.@0003
@000C@0017What do you
want me to do?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, there are plenty of things
you could do.@0003
Chop firewood, clean the laundry,
help with cooking...@0003
@000C@0017...I'm no servant.
I live the mercenary life.@0003
Sorry, but you better ask
someone else...@0003
@0009@0017You'll help us? Fantastic!
I knew you would.@0003 
@000C@0017Wait, that's not what I said!
Were you even listening?!@0003
@0009@0017...Sure I was. But I can
tell that you want to.@0003
@000C@0017No, I don't!@0003
@0009@0017I can see in your eyes
your desire to help.@0003
@000C@0017No you can't!@0003
[044B]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@011E@0009Hey.@0003
@000C@0017You again...
I'm not helping, all right?@0003
@0009@0017Trust me, you don't want to be
a mercenary.@0003
You never know when you
could die.@0003
And you're weak, so that'll be
sooner rather than later.@0003
@000C@0017Grr... You'll regret
saying that...@0003
You don't want to see
me when I'm angry.@0003
@0009Oh?@0003
@000CWhat are you looking at me
like that for?!@0003
I've slain monsters stronger
than any human!@0003
@0009Wow, now that's something.@0003
What kind of beasts?@0003
@000C...Near my village...
there's this weird cave.@0003
When I was a kid, people said
it was filled with monsters.@0003
So one day I got my friend Lot
and we went to defeat them.@0003
@0009Yeah?@0003
@000CThe cave was dark and damp...
Something seemed wrong.@0003
Lot was scared, but I was fine.@0003
I led the way...and finally,
there they were.@0003
The monsters were crawling all
over the cave floor.@0003
Long, skinny bodies slithering
about, all scaly and spotted...@0003
@0009@0017Snakes?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017Well, I guess they were kind of like snakes.
But these were no ordinary snakes.@0003
They were monsters, with poison and
strange dances and weird moves...@0003
@0009@0017Yeah... Snakes.
Anyway, where is this cave?@0003
@000C@0017...What?@0003
@0009@0017I'll go check it out on my
way to the village site.@0003
I'm curious now.@0003
@000C@0017B-but I already killed
all the monsters...@0003
@0009@0017You said they were all over
the cave floor.@0003
Some might have escaped. They were
no ordinary snakes, right?@0003
I want to see them.@0003
@000C@0017Grr...@0003
[044C]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@011E@0009Well, we meet again.@0003
Doesn't looking at my face
make you want to help out?@0003
@000C@0017No.@0003
...But...@0003@0017
When the war is over, I might
just stop by my old home.@0003
And if I get bored, maybe I'll
come and help a little.@0003
@0009Do you have family
back home?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, an older sister who never
stops yelling at me.@0003
@0009...Sigh...@0003
You're pretty stupid,
you know that?@0003
@000CStupid?@0003
What do you mean
by stupid, you--@0003
@0009@0017You've got a home to return to.@0003
You've got someone waiting
for you.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Help us out if you have time,
but your sister is more important.@0003
Do you understand?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, yeah, I know...@0003
Can't wait for her
to scold me again...@0003
[044D]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@0129@0009@0017Shanna, don't come out
front so often.@0003
Pegasi are easy prey
for archers.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I know.@0003
@0009@0017And you're frail, so make sure
you retreat from danger.@0003
@000C@0017Uh-huh.@0003
@0009@0017And--@0003
@000CLot! You're such a worrywart.
I am a knight.@0003
@0009But you're still
in training.@0003
@000CWell, yeah, but...@0003
@0009Just remember that you can never
be overly cautious in battle.@0003
Staying wary will keep you alive.@0003
@000C...Yeah, yeah.@0003
[044E]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@0129@0009@0017Shanna, you can't always
charge in like that.@0003
@000CBut Lot...@0003
@0009No buts.
You should be more--@0003
@000CLot?@0003
@0009Yes?@0003
@000C@0017Why are you always so
concerned about me?@0003
Oh wait, I get it.@0003@0002
Aww, I never knew you felt
that way about me!@0003
@0009@0017Yeah, you wish.@0003
@000CThat's not it?@0003
@0009...I have a little sister back home.@0003
@000CA sister?@0003
Does she look like
me or something?@0003
@0009No, not in the slightest.@0003
@000CThen...@0003
@0009She's a lot younger than you.
She isn't even ten years old.@0003
That's why I worry like I do,
fighting in battles like this...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Shanna, you have an
older sister, right?@0003
@000CYeah, two actually.@0003
@0009Then take care of yourself.
If not for your sake, then for them.@0003
Imagine how they'd feel if
something happened to you.@0003
@000CYeah... You're right.
I'll be more careful.@0003
[044F]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@0129@000CHey, Lot!@0003
@0009@0017Shanna.@0003
You seem to be doing
well lately.@0003
@000C@0017I'm being more careful now.
I don't rush in anymore.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah, not as much as
before, anyway.@0003
@000CShoot, that means I can still
improve, doesn't it...?@0003
@0017Oh yeah, I had something
I wanted to tell you, too.@0003
@0009@0017Something to tell me?
What is it?@0003
@000C@0017
A tip for battle!
Do you want to hear it?@0003
@0009@0017Sure.@0003
@000C@0017Then give me your ear
for a sec.@0003
@0009@0017OK...
Like this?@0003
@000C@0017@0016......@0003@0016
Don't stress yourself
out so much, Brother.@0003
@0009@0017What the...?!@0003
@000C@0017That was from your cute
little sister!@0003
@0009@0017Hey!@0003
Shanna!@0003
@000C@0017Ha ha ha ha!@0003
[0450]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@011F@0009Hey, you're from the
Western Isles, right?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah...
How did you know?@0003
@0009@0017Easy. Your face.@0003
All men from the Isles
have features like yours.@0003
@000C@0017...They do?@0003
@0009@0017Are you going back home
after the war?@0003
If you are, I could
use your help.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah?@0003
@0009@0017I'm planning on building a new
village in the Western Isles.@0003
It'll be for people who lost
their homes during the war.@0003
I want you to help build it.@0003
@000C@0017All right, I'll do
what I can...@0003
@0009@0017Really?
Thanks.@0003
@000C@0017But I can't make any
promises.@0003
I can only help if I'm still
alive when the war ends.@0003
@0009Talking like that already?@0003
@000CI only say it because it's
a distinct possibility.@0003
I'm not one to make empty
promises...@0003
@0009@0017You sure worry a lot for
someone your age.@0003
You'll be getting gray hairs
before thirty at that rate.@0003
@000C@0017...I will?@0003
[0451]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@011F@0009Hey, it's you again.@0003
@000C@0017You're the one who wanted
to build the village...@0003
@0009@0017The planning's going
along smoothly.@0003
A free village,
open to anybody...@0003
It's like a dream
coming true.@0003
@000C@0017Do you have the money
to build it?@0003
@0009@0017...You want logistics now, eh?@0003
To tell the truth... No.@0003
But there are mines in the Isles,@0003
so I just need to go in and find
the mother lode.@0003
@000C@0017That seems pretty unlikely...@0003
...Oh, wait.@0003
I know of an old, deserted
gold mine you could try.@0003
@0009@0017Really?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I went there with my
friend Ward when I was a kid.@0003
There were rumors that the place
was haunted, so nobody went near it.@0003
@0009Go on.@0003
@000CWard was really scared.
He probably believed the rumors.@0003
We went in a ways, and Ward let out
a scream and ran for the entrance.@0003
So I followed him out.@0003
@0009Did he see something?@0003
@000CYeah, snakes.@0003
Tons of them.@0003
They covered the whole
cave floor.@0003
What I want to know is how they
got there in the first place...@0003
But anyway, the mine was
closed because of them.@0003
@0009@0017I see... So there might still
be some gold left in there.@0003
Sounds interesting.@0003
We might get enough money for
the village there.@0003
Say, can you take me when
you get the chance?@0003
@000C@0017I don't mind...
But it'll be dangerous.@0003
@0009@0017Oh, I'm not worried.@0003
You'll be there to protect us.@0003
@000C@0017...I will?@0003
[0452]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@011F@0009Hey, how are you doing?@0003
@000C@0017Still alive, at least.@0003
@0009@0017Don't you die.
I need you to survive.@0003
@000C@0017I don't plan on dying.
I have a sister back home.@0003
And there's also...@0003
@0009@0017Also what?@0003
@000C@0017Nothing. Never mind.@0003
@0009@0017Oh, I get it.@0003
You've got a special somebody
waiting for you, eh?@0003
Well, well, aren't you a
lucky guy?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017I want to go home as soon as
I can, provided I'm alive...@0003
@0009@0017Are you worrying about
that again?@0003
@000C@0017The enemies get stronger
all the time.@0003
I don't know how much
longer I'll last.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I'm confident that we'll win
in the end...@0003
But I just don't know
that I'll make it home.@0003
@0009Come on, don't
be stupid.@0003
@000C...I'm stupid now?@0003
@0009Someone your age should be
enjoying life!@0003
I know you have your sister
to think of.@0003
But let yourself go once
in a while.@0003
You might get a few cuts
and bruises, but that's life.@0003
@000C...I don't like cuts
and bruises.@0003
@0009Don't worry. If you die,
I'll take care of things.@0003
@0017So go out and get killed!
It'll be fine.@0003
...Trust me.@0003@0011
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016Somehow I don't think that came
out like she intended it to...@0003
Was she...trying to cheer me up?@0003
[0453]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012F@0009@0017So...you're Gonzalez.@0003
I hear you've been quite a
nuisance in the Isles.@0003
@000CUh...@0003
@0009What do you fight for?@0003
@000CI...I want
fight with everyone.@0003
But...I useless.@0003
I become strong,
everyone like me.@0003
Become strong.@0003
@0009I see...
Very well. I'll train you.@0003
First, I want you to hit me
as hard as you can.@0003
@000CHit?
I can't...@0003
Hurt you...@0003
@0009Oh yeah...?
Take this!@0003
@0009@0080@000C@000CUgh.@0003@0080@0011@0011
@000C@0010@012FWh-why you hit me?@0003
@000A@0080@000BYou think your puny fists can
hurt ME?! Now hit me!@0003
@000CO-OK...@0003
Raaah!@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0009Oof...@0003@0080@0010
@0009@0010@0120Yeah...
You're pretty strong.@0003
But it's my turn now!
After I sit down for a minute...@0003
[0454]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012F@0009@0017Gonzalez.@0003
Are you keeping up
with your training?@0003
@000CLook. I find this.
I have money.@0003
@0009So you do.
What of it?@0003
@000CI become strong.
I buy armor.@0003
I not get hurt.@0003
@0009Oh yeah...?
Take this!@0003
@0009@0080@000C@000CUgh.@0080@0011@0011@0003
@000AOffense is everything!@0003
If you beat your enemy in a single hit,
he won't even have a chance to hit back!@0003
Only puny worms wear armor!@0003
@000C@0010@012FO-OK...
I wrong.@0003
I beat enemy in one hit.
I buy strong axe.@0003
@000AOh yeah...?@0003
Take this!@0003
@000CEgh.@0080@0011@0011@0003
@000AYou think that a good weapon
makes you strong?@0003
A true warrior fights with
the raw strength of his muscles!@0003
Don't waste your time buying
weapons! Build your muscles!@0003
Build them up so big that you can
crumble walls with a rusty iron axe!@0003
@000C@0010@012FO-OK...@0003
[0455]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012F@0009@0017Ah, Gonzalez.@0003
@000CI...@0003
@0009You needn't say anything, Gonzalez.
I can tell by looking in your eyes.@0003
You've become strong.@0003
You've come a long way from the little
weakling you were when we first met.@0003
@000CI...I...@0003
@0009I know what you're going
to say, Gonzalez.@0003
And you're welcome.
It was my pleasure.@0003
@000CI...@0003
@0009But you still have a
long way to go.@0003
The path to true warriorhood
is hard and neverending.@0003
Now come, Gonzalez.@0003
Let us train until we can tear
down the very sky above!@0003
@000CI...@0003
[0456]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012A@0009@0017Hmm...@0003
So this is a wyvern. It has a
face only a mother could love.@0003
@000C@0017You are...
Bartre?@0003
@0009@0017That I am.@0003
Young man, do you mind if I
touch this creature?@0003
@000CWell, maybe now's not
the best time...@0003
@0009Hm...?
Hmm?!@0003
Why you...@0003
You want a fight,
do you?!@0003
@000CLevrey, down!@0003
@0009......@0003
@000C@0017I'm sorry, he's been a little
tense since training earlier...@0003
Are you hurt?@0003
@0009@0017No, I'm fine.@0003
Say, young man, you have
quite some talent.@0003
You've managed to tame this
beast at your young age.@0003
@000C@0017No, any wyvern rider
can do that much...@0003
@0009@0017Have some pride.
You have talent.@0003
Ah, yes, you said you
were training earlier?@0003
@000CYes, I've been trying to get some
speed in our offense.@0003
@0009You're already a powerful wyvern rider,
yet you seek even more strength.@0003
Now that's a real man.
I wish you luck.@0003
[0457]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012A@0009@0017Ah, young man.@0003
Have you been continuing
your training?@0003
@000CYes, of course.@0003
@0009Very good.
Men must be strong in body.@0003
Men are getting softer and
softer as time passes.@0003
Why, in battle I see grown men
lagging behind little girls!@0003
It's disgraceful.@0003
@000CEr, yes...@0003
We all must become stronger.@0003
@0009Yes, we think alike it seems...@0003
My daughter left home recently.@0003
I've been wondering if perhaps
I didn't discipline her enough...@0003
It's been bothering me for
several days now.@0003
@000CI, uh...
I'm sorry to hear that.@0003
@0009Ah, it's good to talk with
someone full of such insight!@0003
[0458]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012A@0009@0017Zeiss.@0003
@000CYes?@0003
@0009We get along well.@0003
I feel I am at my strongest
when I fight beside you.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, when you're nearby I
feel I have nothing to fear.@0003
It's like...an unstoppable
force is protecting me.@0003
@0009@0017If I had a son, I would have raised
him into a fine young man like you.@0003
You are indeed the perfect match
for my daughter.@0003
@000C@0017Uh...
Thank you.@0003
@0009@0017From now on, think of me as your father.
Feel free to tell me anything.@0003
Is that clear, my son?@0003
@000CUh, yeah...
Thank you, I think.@0003
[0459]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012C
@0009@0017Hm?
Who are you?@0003
@000C@0017
My name's Cath!
You're Bartre, right?@0003
Do you mind if we
talk for a bit?@0003
@0009@0017Sure, I don't
see why not.@0003
@000C@0017Thanks.@0003
You look a lot like
my father, actually.@0003
@0009@0017I do?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah. He's nothing
like you, though.@0003
He's a disgusting
coward.@0003
@0009@0017No, that's not
like me at all.@0003
@000C@0017Talking with you 
reminds me of him.@0003
Bartre, do you think you can hug
me like my father used to do?@0003
@0009Of course.
Like this?@0003
@000CYes, that's it, Bartre.
Thank you.@0003
@0009Any time.@0003@0011
@000C@0011@0007
@000C@0010@012C
Heh... What an idiot.@0003
@0017Just like my father.@0003
[045A]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012C
@000C@0017...Bartre.
Here.@0003
@0009Hm...?
This is my axe.@0003
@000CYeah. And you see
all this other stuff?@0003
It's yours. I stole
it from you.@0003
@0009Well, I'll
be darned...@0003
@000CYup, I'm a thief.@0003
I trick people so I
can steal their stuff.@0003
Well? You gonna
yell at me?@0003
@0009...Cath. Why are you
telling me this?@0003
You could have gotten
away with it.@0003
@000C...I don't know.@0003
I don't even know why I stole
from you in the first place.@0003
I usually only steal from
the rich.@0003
@0009Does it have something
to do with your father?@0003
@000C...Maybe.
I hate my father.@0003
He's such a coward...
I hate his guts.@0003
[045B]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@012C
@000C@0017...My village was burned to
the ground in the war.@0003
A bunch of soldiers came and ordered
us to set our houses on fire.@0003
No one listened... I mean,
who would? They were our homes.@0003
The soldiers got impatient and
drew their weapons...@0003
That's when one of the villagers took
a torch and lit everything on fire.@0003
That villager...was my father.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016All of our houses and crops
were burned to the ground...@0003
My father did nothing but
stand there and watch...@0003
I've hated him ever since.@0003
I swore to myself that I would never
mindlessly bow to power like him.@0003
That's why I...@0003
@0009Cath... You're wrong.@0003
@000CWhat?@0003
@0009No one would burn their
own village down by choice.@0003
Your father...had something
he felt he needed to protect.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Your father didn't have the
strength to defeat the soldiers.@0003
But he was fighting all the same.@0003
He forced himself to burn his
home and crops,@0003
all to protect something
more important.@0003
He was protecting you.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016...Ha...@0003
Not likely.
He's just a coward.@0003
@0017He's nothing like you.@0003
But...maybe it's better to
think he was protecting me...@0003
[045C]
@000C@0010@0121@000CRaigh! Raigh!@0003
@0017Can you hear me,
Raigh?@0003
@0009@0010@0125...Yes, I can hear you. You don't
have to shout like that.@0003
...What do you want?@0003
@000C@0017Here.@0003
That's your share.@0003
@0009@0017Hm?@0003
What are these?@0003
@000C@0017Baked tarts.@0003
The man who delivers our meals
gave me some extra ones.@0003
They look good, don't they?@0003
@0009@0017...Sweets...
They're hard to find nowadays.@0003
Savor them and eat them
for yourself.@0003
@000C@0017It's no fun if I eat
them alone.@0003
Let's eat them together
a little later.@0003
Anyway, I have to
go now.@0003@0011
@0006@000C@0010@0121Oh, one more thing.@0003
You should at least respond
when you're spoken to!@0003
I don't mind that much, but
strangers might get ideas.@0003
They might think that you're
antisocial or something.@0003@0011
@0009@0017Well, they'd be right.@0003
...But whatever.@0003
My dear brother is as
naive as ever.@0003
[045D]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0121@000C@0017Raigh!@0003
@0009...What?@0003
@000C@0017Are you doing all right?@0003
@0009@0017What do you mean,
"all right"?@0003
@000CI was a little worried that
you'd left again.@0003
The first time was so sudden.@0003
You just left a note and
disappeared.@0003
I thought you might have walked
off again without a word...@0003
@0009...Lugh.@0003
@000CYour note said you wanted to train
your dark magic skills alone.@0003
Was I...in your way?
You didn't want me around...?@0003
@0009N-no, that's not it...@0003
I always planned to come back once
I became a powerful shaman.@0003
@000C@0017I knew it, Raigh!@0003
I knew you'd come back
for the children!@0003
@0009@0017What?
No, that's not--@0003
@000C@0017I'm so relieved!
You haven't changed at all.@0003
You're still the kind-hearted
Raigh I know and love.@0003
I'll go pray!@0003
I'm going to thank the gods
for letting me see you again!@0003@0011
@0009@0017Uh... Bye, I guess?@0003
...Sigh...
Why is he like that?@0003
[045E]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0121@0009@0017Lugh, I need to tell
you something.@0003
@000C@0017What is it, Raigh?@0003
@0009@0017I...I'm sorry I left the orphanage
without saying anything.@0003
I...uh...I want to apologize
for that...@0003
@000C@0017It's all right now.@0003
I understand.@0003
@0009@0017A-and one more thing!@0003
I'll never disappear without
telling you again!@0003
@000C@0017Great.@0003
@0009@0017So will you stop hovering
around me all the time?@0003
Come on. Please!!@0003
@000C...Do you dislike
being near me?@0003
@0009Er...@0003
N-no, not exactly,
but...@0003
@000C@0017Then what's the problem?@0003
Who knows if we'll still be
together when we grow up?@0003
@0009@0017...Lugh?@0003
@000C@0017If...@0003
If I don't make it through this war,@0003
promise me you'll pick up the
children at the St. Elimine Church.@0003
@0009@0017Don't say that.
We'll both survive.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah... You're right.@0003
Something's wrong with me today.@0003
@0009@0017I won't let you die.@0003
You're my brother.
My only brother.@0003
@000C@0017Thanks, Raigh.@0003
[045F]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0121@0009@0017Oh... H-hey. You're Lugh, right?@0003
I, uh, I'm sorry I mistook you
for your brother the other day...@0003
@000CNo, Hugh, it's all right.@0003
We're twins, so no one can
really tell us apart anyway.@0003
@0009Oh man, I'm really sorry, though.@0003
I can't believe I just lost it and
grabbed you by the collar like that.@0003
I'm a terrible person.@0003
@000C...But it was Raigh's fault for
running off with your spell tome.@0003
I should be apologizing to you.@0003
@0009No, never mind that.@0003
It was my fault for letting
my guard down anyway.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
@0016......@0003@0016
Yeah, you're right, never mind.@0003
That whole business let us meet
each other, so it's not that bad.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah! We're both mages, so
let's help each other along!@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, actually, I was hoping that
you would teach me some things.@0003
[0460]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0121@000C@0017Hugh!@0003
Are you all right?@0003
@0009@0017Huh?@0003
What do you mean?@0003
@000C@0017Your elbow's bleeding!@0003
We have to wrap it...@0003
@0009@0017Oh, I got hit in that
last fight.@0003
Don't worry about it.
It's no big deal.@0003
@000C@0017Yes it is!@0003
You can't leave a
wound like that alone...@0003
@0009Lugh?
You look a little pale...@0003
@000C...I've lost enough people
I care about already.@0003
...I'll treat your wound.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
All right, thanks.@0003
[0461]
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0121@0009@0017Lugh, about before...@0003
@000CI'm sorry!@0003
You said you were all right,
but I just ignored you and...@0003
I'm sure you don't like it when kids
act like they know more than you...@0003
@0009Don't be ridiculous.
Don't apologize for helping me.@0003
@000CBut you seemed to be avoiding me,
so I thought you were mad...@0003
@0009...I was embarrassed,
that's all.@0003
@000CWhat? Why?@0003
@0009Because...@0003
No one ever cared for me that
much my whole life...@0003
My grandmother raised me, but
she's a real kook.@0003
She's given me injuries way
worse than this one,@0003
but she never once used her
staves to heal me!@0003@0017
I was just happy to have someone
concerned about me for a change...@0003
Thanks, man.@0003
You're my new best friend.@0003
@000COf course, Hugh!
Let's be friends forever!!@0003
[0462]
@000C@0010@012E
Whew... Sorry to work you
so hard, Tryffin... Good girl.@0003
@0009@0010@0121Wow!@0003
A wyvern!@0003
Wow, it's so big!@0003
Is this wyvern
yours?@0003
Will it get angry
if I touch it?@0003
@000CNo, go ahead.
She's a gentle one.@0003
@0009Wow, such hard scales...
Her fangs are so sharp too!@0003
Amazing...
Are you a wyvern rider?@0003
@000CYes, I am.@0003
@0009Really?!@0003
I thought only Bern
had wyvern riders!@0003
@000C@0017@0016!@0003@0016
@0009@0017They say Bern's wyvern riders are
unbeatable, so I was a little nervous...@0003
But they're nothing if we have
wyvern riders on our side, too!@0003
I want to defeat Bern, but I'm
not very good with my magic yet,@0003
so I can't do all that much on
my own...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Oh... I better get going.
See you later!@0003
Thanks for letting me
pet your wyvern.@0003
@000C@0017Yes... See you...@0003
[0463]
@000C@0010@012E@0009@0010@0121@0009@0017Hello!@0003
Can I give this to your wyvern?@0003
@000C...Hello.
What are those?@0003
@0009I got some extra baked tarts, so I
wanted to give some to the wyvern.@0003
Oh wait, do wyverns even eat
food like this?@0003
@000CYou love them, don't you, Tryffin?
Thank you.@0003
@0009She's called Tryffin?
Can I call her that, too?@0003
@000COf course.@0003
@0009Here you go, Tryffin.
Eat up.@0003
Good, aren't they?@0003
@000C...What is your name?@0003
@0009Me?@0003
I'm Lugh from Lycia.
What's your name?@0003
Where are you from?@0003
@000CI'm Melady.
...I come from Bern.@0003
@0009@0016!!!@0016@0003@0006
...You're joking, right?@0003
@000C...I'm sorry. I couldn't get
myself to say it sooner...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0011
@000C@0016Wait!
Lugh!@0003@0007@0002
...I know it was inevitable,
but still...@0003
I'm sorry, Tryffin. Just when you
had made a little friend...@0003
[0464]
@000C@0010@012E@0009@0010@0121@0009Hello, Madam Melady.@0003
@000C@0017Lugh!@0003
@0009...I'm sorry I ran off
like that before.@0003
@000C@0017No, it's all right.@0003
I'm glad you're speaking
to me again.@0003
@0009I didn't want things to
end like that.@0003
@0017...Will you listen to
my story?@0003
@000COf course.@0003
@0009My parents died when I was four,@0003
and ever since then I'd been
living at an orphanage in Lycia.@0003
It was tiny, with only seven kids and
one priest who we all called Poppa.@0003
The oldest kids were Chad and my twin
brother Raigh and I,@0003
so we three took care of the younger
children.@0003
We were poor, but we were happy
anyway.@0003
But after Bern started this war,
our lives began to change.@0003
Food started getting scarce, and we
sometimes had to resort to begging...@0003
Chad... He started stealing food
without telling Poppa...@0003
Raigh got fed up with that lifestyle
and left one day without a word.@0003
I hated Bern... We all did.@0003
Bern was responsible for everything...
Bern killed Poppa...@0003
I just wanted Bern to disappear.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016That's what I kept telling myself.@0003
..Anger motivates better
than sorrow...@0003
Anger has kept me alive...@0003
So that I can protect the
children...@0003@0002
...Sigh...@0003
So...for now, at least until
the war ends...@0003
I have to stay angry at Bern.@0003@0002
...But you're on our side, right?
I don't have to hate you...@0003
Do I?@0003
@000C@0017It would make me so happy if
you didn't hate me, Lugh.@0003
If you would let me, I'd even
like to be...your friend.@0003
@0009Thank you, Madam Melady.@0003
[0465]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@012F@000C@0017Li...lina.
Lilina.@0003
@0009@0017Yes?@0003
@000C@0017This.@0003
I give you.@0003
@0009@0017Oh... What a pretty white flower.
Thank you, Gonzalez.@0003
@000C@0017Th... Thank...?
What that?@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
@000C@0017I not smart...
I not know many words...@0003
@0009@0017Oh...
I said "Thank you."@0003
It's an expression
of gratitude.@0003
@000C@0017Grat...?@0003
@0009@0017Um...@0003
When someone does something for you and
you feel happy, you say, "Thank you."@0003
@000C@0017Thank...you?@0003
@0009@0017That's right...
Thank you.@0003
[0466]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@012F@000CL-Lilina. Lilina.
Thank...you...@0003
@0009No, Gonzalez,
it's not for greetings.@0003
@000CThis, I give you.@0003
You pretty.
Flower pretty.@0003
Look good together...@0003
@0009Thank you very much,
Gonzalez.@0003
@000C@0017Thank you...@0003
@0009@0017This really is a
beautiful flower...@0003
They grow by Roy's
home, too.@0003
@000C@0017Roy?
Who Roy?@0003
@0009@0017Roy is the leader of this army.@0003
He's not very strong, but...
he's very kind.@0003
@000C@0017...Lilina like Roy?@0003
@0009@0017Hm...?@0003
Yes... Yes, I like
him very much.@0003
@000C@0017@0016......@0003@0016
...I leave.@0003
@0009What?
Wait, Gonzalez...@0003
[0467]
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@012F@0009@0017Wait!
Gonzalez!@0003
What's wrong?@0003
Why have you been
avoiding me?@0003
@000CSh...shut up!@0003
@0009Ah!@0003
@000CG-go away!
Go, go, go!@0003@0011
@0009@0016......@0003@0011
@0007
@000C@0010@012F@0016Only hurt me if
I talk to you...@0003
I know...
I ugly, you pretty...@0003
We different.@0003
But...I never forget.
I human because of you...@0003
I never forget.@0003@0002
...Thank you...@0003@0007
@0009@0010@0122...No.@0003
@000CLi...lina?@0003
@0009"Thank you"...is something
you say when you're happy.@0003
You don't use it when...
you leave someone.@0003
@000CLilina...
You cry?@0003
@0009You're crying too...
Why are you crying?@0003
@000CI...I...@0003
@0009Gonzalez...
Don't leave me.@0003
@000CLilina...@0003
@0009Don't tell me to go away...
Please...@0003
Stay with me...@0003
@000CLilina...
I...I...@0003
@0009Gonzalez...@0003
@000CWaaahhh...@0003
[0468]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0123@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009@0017Hm...?@0003
Who's that I see sneaking by
without so much as a hello?@0003
Whoever it is, he seems to
have a death wish.@0003
@000C@0017O-oh!
H-hello there, Grandmother!@0003
Fancy meeting you here!@0003
@0009@0017Don't give me that, boy!@0003
You've been avoiding me,
haven't you?@0003
Are you shy, or just
stupid?@0003
@000C@0017Well, Grandmother, you seem to
be keeping in good health...@0003
Not planning on dying anytime
soon, I hope?@0003
@0009@0017Harumph!@0003
If I dropped dead who would keep my
pathetically helpless grandson in line?@0003
So tell me. It was three years ago I
sent you out to study the darkness.@0003
I hope you have a good excuse for
using that putrid anima magic.@0003
@000C@0017Actually, I became a mage.@0003
@0009@0017...I must finally be going deaf. I thought
I heard you say you became a mage.@0003
@000C@0017Oh, sorry, I'll say it
so you can hear.@0003
I!@0004 USE!@0004 ANIMA!@0004
MAGIC!@0004 NOW!@0003
@0009@0017You...you blundering
failure!@0003
You dare show your face
in front of me?!@0003
@000C@0017Help!
Murderer!@0003
@0009@0017Foolish boy...@0003
@000C@0017Hey, where are you going,
Grandmother?@0003
@0009@0017I always get a migraine when
I talk to you.@0003
I never want to see you again.@0003@0011
@000C@0017...I thought I was a dead man for sure.@0003
Either she's gotten soft with age,@0003
or she was dumbfounded at how
handsome I've become.@0003
Either way, lucky me!@0003
[0469]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0123@0009Hugh!@0003
@000C@0017Grandmother!@0003@0005
@0016......@0003@0016
@0009...What are you doing?@0003
@000CHuh? Oh, I'm just
bracing myself.@0003
For when you blast me with
your magic and all that.@0003
@0009...You really are a fool.@0003
@000CDon't say that!
Come on, I'm your only grandson!@0003
@0009Yes, most unfortunate, that.@0003
But there's nothing to be done
about it now, I'm afraid.@0003
Anyway, I need something from you.@0003
@000C@0017Really?
That's a surprise.@0003
@0009@0017Give me back that Nosferatu tome I
lent you when I sent you out.@0003
You have no use for it now.@0003
@000CGulp...@0003
@0009You...do have it, don't you?@0003
@000CUh...@0003
@0009Hugh, those tomes are hard
to find!@0003
I sincerely hope you didn't
pawn it...@0003
@000CWait!
No, no, no!@0003
I didn't sell it!
I gave it away!@0003
@0009What?!
And that's any better?@0003
@000CNo, but listen!@0003
I met this kid who was studying dark magic,
and I traveled with him for a while.@0003
The kid was an orphan, so I felt kinda
bad for him, I guess.@0003
Anyway, one morning when I woke up,
the kid was gone, and so was the tome!@0003
@0009So you didn't give it away.
A child stole it from you.@0003
@000CI suppose that's one
way of putting it.@0003
@0009That's the only way
of putting it!@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
H-hey, Grandmother.@0003
I'll leave if your
head hurts again.@0003
@0009...Yes, please do.@0003
Your departed parents would never forgive
me for reducing their only son to ash.@0003
@000CY-you're right!
Bye!@0003@0011
@0009He's just like his father
was at that age...@0003
He tries to be bad, but his
heart is too kind.@0003
Why couldn't he inherit his
talent for dark magic as well?@0003
[046A]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0123@000C@0017Grandmother!@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000CWas my old man good at dark magic?
I don't really remember.@0003
@0009...Why?@0003
@000CWell, I really did try to study dark magic,
but I couldn't seem to pick it up at all.@0003
That kid I told you about was
doing great, though.@0003
I thought that maybe I don't have the
talent, so I switched to anima magic.@0003
But the thing is, how can I not have the
talent for it when I have your blood?@0003
That's why I wanna know if my old man
had the talent or not.@0003
@0009Your father had more talent for dark
magic than you could ever hope for.@0003
@000CWhat?
That makes no sense.@0003
...Wait! I get it!
Of course!@0003
@0009An epiphany?@0003
@000CYes! You're not really my
grandmother, are you?!@0003
O-ow! What did you do
that for?!@0003
@0009Your stupidity. I'm your
grandmother, like it or not.@0003
You would never have been born
were it not for me.@0003
@000C@0017But that's impossible!@0003
This handsome face couldn't have
come from those hideous wrinkles.@0003
@0009I was a stunning beauty when I was
your age.@0003
I would court men like you and drop them
once I'd milked all the money out of them.@0003
@000C@0017Ouch...@0003
@0009Your kindness comes from your father,@0003
and your talent for anima magic
comes from your mother.@0003
Your stupidity... That's probably
from your grandfather.@0003
@000CWhat?
My mom wasn't a shaman?@0003
@0009@0017I was determined at first to make my son's
wife a shaman.@0003
But your mother was a fine young lady with a
distinct talent for anima magic, so I caved...@0003
@0017...I was so proud of them both...
And yet they died so young...@0003
@000CI'm sorry that all you have left is
a pathetic failure of a grandson.@0003
@0009@0017@0016......@0003@0016
Don't be.@0003
How I missed yelling at you
while you were gone.@0003
Perhaps misbehaving children really
are the most precious after all.@0003
All I want for you is to live a
long and fulfilling life, Hugh.@0003
@000C@0017...Grandmother.@0003
[046B]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0123@000C@0017Hey!@0003
@0009Oh.@0003
@000CThere you are!@0003
I never thought I'd
see you here.@0003
I've been looking
for you!@0003
@0009...Well, I sure wasn't
looking for you.@0003
@000CYou took advantage of my
kindness...@0003
Brats like you are why
I hate kids.@0003
Now give me back my
Nosferatu tome.@0003
@0009Ah, yes.
That thing.@0003
@000C...You haven't used it up
already, have you?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000C...Hey...@0003
@0009...Calm down, I've got it.
I was just borrowing it.@0003
I was planning to give
it back some day.@0003
@000CY-you little thief...@0003
I lent it to you because you
said you wanted to see it.@0003
I didn't expect you to run
off with it!@0003
@0009Look, like I said, I'm
borrowing it, not stealing it.@0003
@000CThen when are you
going to return it?@0003
@0009Let's see...@0003
I suppose I could give it
back after I use it 20 times.@0003
@000CYou better keep your word!@0003
@0009Of course.@0003@0011
@000C...Oh well, I guess I
just gotta be patient...@0003
Hey, wait a minute!@0003
It'll be all used up
after 20 times!@0003
[046C]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0123@000C@0017Hey.@0003
@0009Oh.@0003
@000CI'm not letting you go this time!
Give me back that Nosferatu tome now!@0003
@0009...Sorry, but I can't.@0003
@000CWhy not?!@0003
@0009You're a mage.@0003
What's the point in you having
a Nosferatu tome anyway?@0003
@000CErgh...
That's not the point...@0003
@0009This powerful tome would be a
waste in your hands.@0003
It would be your fault if we
lost the battle without it.@0003
@000CEr...@0003
F-fine, I'll let you have
it for now.@0003
But I want it back with
interest, you hear?!@0003@0011@0007
@0009@0017...Heh, what an idiot.
So gullible.@0003
I can't even comprehend
such bumbling foolery.@0003
@000C@0010@0123@0017...Hey.@0003
@0009...Uh-oh...@0003@0011
@000CYou little...!
Give it back to me now!@0003
[046D]
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0123
@000C@0017Hm?
What's this?@0003
@0009I'll give you that gem.@0003
@000CWhere did you get this?@0003
@0009That's none of your
business.@0003
It's a fair trade for
the spell tome.@0003
@000CNope.
I can't accept this!@0003
@0009Why not?@0003
You can sell the gem to buy
another Nosferatu tome.@0003
@000CThis isn't about money.
It's about pride.@0003
...Let's see...
I want to hear an apology.@0003
Then you can have the
spell tome for free.@0003
@0009@0017Hah...@0003
How can someone be so stubborn
about something so stupid?@0003
@000C@0017Hey, look at you.@0003
All you have to do is
say you're sorry.@0003
@0009I won't do it.@0003
I've paid you back with
the gemstone.@0003
@000CWell, I'm not taking it.@0003
You owe me until you
apologize!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C......@0003@0016
@0009...Hmph...
Adults.@0003
@000C...Hmph...
Kids.@0003
[046E]
@000C@0010@0123One, two, three...@0003
Yup, that's all of it.@0003
Looks like I can trust Roy
to give me a steady paycheck.@0003
Time to show my worth...@0003
@0009@0010@012C@0017Hey!@0003
@000C@0017Wh-what the--?@0003
@0009@0017Where'd you get all that money?
Are you a thief, too?@0003
@000C@0017Do I look like a thief to you?@0003
This is what they paid me
when I joined.@0003
@0009@0017What?!
That's not fair!@0003
I've been working for
nothing all this time!@0003
@000C@0017Well, I guess you're not good
enough to get paid.@0003
You've got to show your worth
if you want cash.@0003
@0009...Hmm...@0003
@0017Sounds like a challenge!@0003
I'll show you how great
of a thief I am.@0003
I'll steal that money from
right under your nose!@0003@0011
@000C@0017Wait, what?!@0003
Fine!
Let's see you try!@0003
[046F]
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0123@0009Hey, Hugh!@0003
@000C@0016...!@0003
@0009@0016What are you getting all
nervous about?@0003
I'm just trying to be friendly here.@0003
Do you really think I'd try to
rob you in a place like this?@0003
@000C@0017I don't trust you!@0003
I'm gonna be on my guard
whenever you're around.@0003
@0009@0017Hah, you're so petty.@0003
You're getting all worked up
over a couple thousand gold?@0003
@000C@0017W-well, it's my money!@0003
@0009OK, I guess there's no getting past
you when you're super alert like that.@0003
You win for now.@0003
@000CGood!
Give it up and go!@0003
@0009@0017All right.
But remember, Hugh!@0003
I'll be back!@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
[0470]
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0123@000C@0017You again?!@0003
Get away from me.
I'm not giving you my money.@0003
@0009@0017Are you still on about that?
Talk about obsessive!@0003
@000C@0017Then stop trying to take it!@0003
I mean, you're a thief.@0003
Don't you already have
bags of money somewhere?@0003
@0009No.@0003
Why would I?@0003
@000CYeah, right!@0003
I see you running around
looting chests all the time!@0003
@0009I give it all to the poor.@0003
@0017I'm the Master Thief.
I have my dignity.@0003
I never keep a single coin
of the money I steal.@0003
@000C@0017Then...are you going to give my
money to the poor as well?@0003
@0009Of course.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016Then hey...@0003
You can have maybe a hundred...@0003
No...@0003
I can give you around half
of this money...@0003
@0009...No.@0003
I'm the Master Thief.
I have my dignity.@0003
I don't take charity.@0003
@000CLook, I'm giving it to you.
Just take it!@0003
@0009I said no.
I don't want it.@0003
@0017Besides...@0003@0002
I've already
got your money.@0003
@000CWhat?!@0003
Wh...what the heck?!
When did you switch my...?@0009@0011@0003
@000CCath!@0003
Wait!@0003
Just wait a minute,
please!@0003
[0471]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0125@0009Hm...@0003
@000C@0017...What?@0003
@0009@0017I see you use dark magic.@0003
Although you appear to
be a beginner.@0003
@000C@0017...Look, old lady.
I'm busy.@0003
I don't have time for
geriatrics like you.@0003
@0009Come now, there's no need
to be so impatient.@0003
Studying by yourself won't
get you anywhere, anyway.@0003
@000C@0016?!@0003@0016
How did you know I
study on my own...?@0003
@0009...I haven't lived this
long for nothing, boy.@0003
I know the darkness much
better than you do.@0003
@000CWho...@0003
Who are you?@0003
@0009My name is Niime.@0003
Remember it...@0003
[0472]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0125@0009Ah, it's that impetuous
little chap again.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0017You... You're the Mountain Hermit.@0003
The master of darkness.@0003
@0009@0017I'm more famous than I realized.
What do you want?@0003
@000C@0017
...I...I want you to
teach me dark magic.@0003@0002
Teach me everything!@0003
@0009@0017Hm...@0003
Is that how you ask
for a favor, boy?@0003
@000C@0017...I can change my tone if
it's not to your liking.@0003
If you want me to grovel,
I will.@0003
Just please, teach me
your dark magic!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@0017You're amusing...@0003
...All right, try
reading this to start.@0003
@000C@0017...What...is this...?@0003
@0009@0017You don't know?@0003
It's archaic writing used
in the oldest spell tomes.@0003
@000C@0017What...?@0003
The ancient scrolls I know
aren't written like this...@0003
@0009@0017Can you understand now
how deep dark magic is?@0003
You can have that.
Good luck reading it.@0003@0011@0007
@000C@0017Hmph...@0003
Piece of cake...@0003
[0473]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0125@0009Well?
How are your studies going?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009Hm...@0003
Don't even have the time
to talk, do you?@0003
You're a rude one, and you
lack respect for your elders.@0003
But you do seem to be serious
about learning dark magic.@0003
Why do you seek the power
of darkness, boy?@0003
@000C@0017...I don't have any grandiose
reason or anything.@0003
I use dark magic for my own
purposes.@0003
I want to protect those I hold dear
and destroy all who oppose me.@0003
That's the power I seek.@0003
@0009This power...
It's not to be taken lightly.@0003
It can turn the whole planet
upside down if used incorrectly.@0003
@000C@0017Heh... So?@0003
I don't mind blowing up a
planet or two if I have to.@0003
@0009@0017...Good.@0003
Well said, lad.@0003
Now come... Come into the
depths of darkness...@0003@0002
You can start by mastering
that book I gave you.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
...ank you...@0003
@0009Hm?
What was that?@0003
@000C...Nothing.@0003
[0474]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@012D@000C@0017Oh...@0003
Hello...@0003
@0009@0017So you're the shaman
of Nabata?@0003
@000C@0017Yes...@0003
My name...is Sophia...@0003
@0009@0017A shy one, are we?@0003
I suppose you would be after spending
your whole life in that place...@0003
You remind me of me when I was
your age.@0003
@000C@0017Really...?@0003
@0009@0017My name is Niime.@0003
I want to know more about
your village in Nabata.@0003
@000C@0017About the village...?@0003
@0009@0017That's right.@0003
But before that...
Are you human? Or dragon?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017I am human...@0003
At least...
my father was human...@0003
@0009@0017I see...@0003
Sorry to be so intrusive.
Don't worry about it.@0003
[0475]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@012D@000C@0017Arcadia...lies within the
sandstorms of the desert...@0003
There aren't many pure dragons...@0003
But there are many people...with
dragon blood...in their veins...@0003
@0009@0017I know that you're a shaman,
but what exactly do you do?@0003
Rain dances and the like?@0003
@000C@0017I...can see...@0003
@0009You can see?@0003
@000CYes... I can sometimes see...
the future...@0003
@0009...Really?@0003
Is that because of the
dragon blood in you?@0003
@000C...I...don't know...@0003
@0009Hm...@0003
Don't let anyone know about
that power of yours.@0003
It could be dangerous for
our enemies.@0003
Even just the next day's
weather could decide a battle.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016@0017Not all outsiders are nice
people.@0003
I heard you were held captive
by Bern.@0003
I'm sure you don't want to go
through that again.@0003
@000C@0017No...@0003
I don't...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016@0017...Don't worry.@0003
Roy would never think of
doing that to you.@0003
You're safe here.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I feel that way...@0003
[0476]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@012D@0009@0017What are dragons, anyway?
Where do they come from?@0003
What are they here for?@0003
@000C...I don't know...@0003
I don't know...
anything specific...@0003
@0009Hm... Interesting.@0003
You don't know anything about the dragons
despite having their blood in your veins.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016If you were a normal girl, you
could lead an ordinary life,@0003
not having to worry about people
hunting you down for your power...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016I...I'm happy with myself...@0003
Even the dragon blood that flows
within me... It makes me who I am...@0003
@0009Yes... You're right.@0003
@0017You've a strong will.@0003
@000C@0017Me...? Strong...?@0003
@0009@0017Yes, you're strong.@0003
You really are just like me
when I was your age.@0003
@000C@0017D...do you really
think so...?@0003
[0477]
@000C@0010@0125@0009@0010@012D@000C@0017Hey, you there!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Hey! Are you deaf or are
you just ignoring me?!@0003
@0009...Uh...
...Me?@0003
@000CIs there anyone else here?
You're a real idiot, aren't you?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016@0017Anyway, I heard you
use elder magic.@0003
Is that true?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Let me see that spell tome.
I've never see--@0003@0080@000E
@0017Ouch!@0003@0002
What the...?!
Did you just hit me?@0003
@0009...Don't...touch me...
please...@0003
@000C@0017You've got guts,
I'll give you that.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Whatever. You win.@0003
But you better show me that
spell tome next time!@0003@0011
@0009@0016......@0003
[0478]
@000C@0010@0125@0007@0009@0010@012D@0016......@0003
@000C@0016@0017Whoa!
Y-you again?!@0003
I didn't even notice you...@0003
S-so what do you want?!
Come to hit me again?@0003
@0009...Here...@0003
@000CThis dark tome!@0003
Some say it exists
only in legend...@0003
@0009...Yes...
...You're well-learned...@0003
@000COf course I am!@0003
I've been searching
for this for so long!@0003
@0017So this is it...@0003
Wow...I can feel
its power...!@0003
@0009@0017...Do you want it...?@0003
@000CI can have it?!
Are...are you sure?@0003
Can't you use it?
Why give it to me?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016@0011
@000CHey, wait! Hey!@0003
[0479]
@000C@0010@0125@0009@0010@012D@000C@0017Hey, you over there! You!@0003
With the long hair dragging
on the ground!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I'm giving this tome
back to you.@0003
@0009...What?
...Why...?@0003
@000CI don't want charity.
I'm not a beggar.@0003
@0009...Even so...I want
you...to have it...@0003
@000CWhat?
Why?@0003
@0009...Because...you are
a good person...@0003
@000CHuh?@0003
@0009...You always act tough...@0003
...But...you have a kind heart...
so...you deserve it...@0003
@000CI have a kind heart?!@0003
You're the first person other than
my brother I've heard say that.@0003
@0009...I know you...better than
you know yourself...@0003
@000C...Don't talk like that.
It's creepy.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Well, it doesn't
bother me, though.@0003
@0009@0017...Thank you...@0003
@000C@0017...What's your name?
I'm Raigh.@0003
@0009@0017...Raigh...@0003
My name...is Sophia...@0003
[047A]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@0126@000C@0017Echidna!@0003
@0009Hey, Larum.
What do you need?@0003
@000CWhat's happening with
the plan?@0003
@0009Plan?@0003
@000CYou know, the plan to
build that village.@0003
@0009Oh, that plan.@0003
I've been recruiting
a lot of help.@0003
Do you want to
help out, too?@0003
@000COf course!@0003
What do you need
me to do?@0003
@0009Dance, of course.@0003
Your dancing cheers everyone up.@0003
It makes people want to get up
and get back to work.@0003
@000CReally?@0003
Hmm...
I can cook, too.@0003
You know my special
protein--@0003
@0009No, thank you.@0003
@000CW-what?@0003
@0009Ever since I founded the resistance,
I've been eating your...@0003
Well, I don't know what it is, but
it's certainly not "food".@0003
@000CWell, I never!
I always work so hard on it...@0003
@0009Look, Larum.@0003
Good cooks don't burn the house
down when making a proper meal.@0003
@000CIt wasn't a big loss
considering how tasty it was.@0003
@0009The wails and moans of the
resistance soldiers...@0003
I can still hear them
echoing in my ears.@0003
Has Elffin ever eaten it?@0003
@000CYeah, and he didn't even cry.
Or say anything, for that matter.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000CSee?@0003
Everyone else just has something
wrong with their taste buds.@0003
My food was probably too
high-class for them.@0003
Actually...Lord Roy would
appreciate my culinary skills.@0003
Yes! I'm sorry, Echidna, but
I'm going to prove you wrong.@0003
I'll make Lord Roy try
my cooking!@0003@0011
@0009...May Lord Roy rest in peace...@0003
[047B]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@0126@000COh, Echidna.@0003
@0009Larum. Hey...@0003
You said you were going to
give that stuff to Roy, but...@0003
Did you actually do it?@0003
@000C@0017What's that supposed to mean?!
He praised me!@0003
He said that it was really...@0003
Uh... That it looked really good.@0003
@0009So he ate it, huh?@0003
@0017When's the funeral?@0003
@000C@0017Hmph!@0003
I just wasn't doing too well
that day!@0003
My father always says
my cooking is delicious.@0003
@0009@0017Don't feel bad.@0003
Even if your cooking stinks, your
dancing is still the best around.@0003
I wish I could do what you do.
Make people enjoy life, I mean.@0003
@000C...You know, you're
really selfless.@0003
@0009@0017W-what?@0003
@000C@0017You're always thinking about others.@0003
You're even building a village so
that people can live in peace.@0003
@0009I...@0003
@000CYou're like one of those heroes
in a bard's epic!@0003
You appear, help the needy, and
leave as suddenly as you came...@0003
You're mysterious too since you
never talk about yourself.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah... I don't.@0003
@000C@0017I won't pry.@0003
I am curious, but I'm sure there's a
good reason you don't talk about it.@0003
[047C]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@0126@000CHey, Echidna!@0003
@0009Yeah?@0003
@000CI just had a really
great idea!@0003
@0009What is it?@0003
@000CDo you want to hear it?@0003
@0009Well, yeah.@0003
@000CAre you sure?@0003
@0009Yes, I'm postive.
Come on. Let's hear it.@0003
@000COK.@0003
I was thinking, when the village
is done, let's make a statue.@0003
@0009What kind of statue?@0003
@000CA statue of you!@0003
It can have an engraving that says,
"Here lies a great hero..."@0003
Or something like that.@0003
@0009@0017Hold on there.
I don't plan on dying yet.@0003
@000CAnyway, it's your village, so there
has to be a statue of you somewhere.@0003
Try to come up with a good pose
for it.@0003@0011
@0009@0017She's an odd girl...@0003
But I guess I knew
that already.@0003
@000C@0010@0126Oh, one more thing!@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000CDon't you go disappearing on us!
We all love you.@0003
Don't you dare try and run off!@0003@0011
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016Yeah... I won't, Larum.@0003
[047D]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0135@000C@0017Hey, you...@0003
@0009@0080@000BEeeeeeeek!
A pirate!@0003
@000CW-wait a minute!@0003
@0009Eeeeeeeek!@0003@0080@000B@0080@000B
Help me, help me, help me!@0003
@000CS-stop...
Wait!@0003
Listen to me!@0003
@0009What? Why should I?
Pirates are all the same.@0003
You're just going to say, "Shut up!"@0003
Or, "You'd better keep quiet if you
want to live!" Or something like that.@0003
Oh no!
I'm looking death in the face!@0003
But just you wait.@0003
Soon Lord Roy'll come to my rescue
on a shining white stallion...@0003
@000C...Uh, are you done?@0003
Listen.
I'm not a pirate anymore.@0003
@0009Hmph!@0003
I know better than to listen to
your honeyed words!@0003
I know you just want to kidnap
me because I'm so irresistible.@0003
@000C...Not a chance.@0003
@0009What?! Are you saying I'm
not cute enough to kidnap?!@0003
@000CLook, you...@0003
No... Forget it.
See you around. Or not.@0003@0011
@0009Hey, wait!@0003
[047E]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0135@0009@0017@0080@000BEeeeeeek!
It's the pirate again!@0003
@000CI said I'm not...@0003
@0009You're still trying to cover up
the obvious truth?@0003
Your hairstyle, your clothes...@0003
Everything about you just screams,
"Yo ho ho, I'm a pirate!"@0003
@000C...Fine...
Have it your way.@0003
@0009Aha!
You admit it!@0003
So? What's next?@0003
You still want to
kidnap me, right?@0003
@000CSeriously...@0003
Just listen to what
I have to say...@0003
@0009Oh no!
I'm looking death in the face!@0003
But just you wait.@0003@0002
Lord Roy could beat you down
any day of the week!@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0080@000F@000B@0010@0126
@0017"Are you hurt, Larum?"@0003@0011
@000A@0010@0126@0017"Oh, Lord Roy..."@0003@0011
@000B@0010@0126@0017"Larum, I can't live
without you."@0003@0011
@000A@0010@0126@0017"Oh, me neither, milord..."@0003@0002
And then he moves in close
and... @0080@000COoooohhhh!@0003
@000D@0016......@0003
@000A@0016Hey, where are
you going?@0003
@000DAway...@0003
Talking with you
is exhausting.@0003
[047F]
@0009@0010@0126@000C@0010@0135@000C@0017Hey.@0003
@0009It's the pirate!@0003
Are you still
trying to--@0003
@000CThis is yours, right?@0003
@0009Oh...@0003
I lost this ribbon
the other day. Wait!@0003
I get it.@0003
You stole it, right?!@0003
@000CWhy would I return it if I
stole it?!@0003
I found it lying on the ground
and I thought it might be yours.@0003
@0009Oh.@0003
Then why didn't you say
so in the first place?@0003
@000CI would have if you let me!@0003
You just started screaming
whenever we met!@0003
You should stop and
listen once in a while...@0003
@0009@0017You're not a bad guy then.@0003
I had nothing to be scared
of all along.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0011
@0009@0016Hold on there, buster.@0003
I'll show you a special dance
in return.@0003
Hey, I said wait...@0003
What?!@0003
Are you saying you don't
want to see my dance?!@0003
[0480]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0128@000C@0017Juno...
Are you all right?@0003
@0009Oh?@0003
Are you looking out
for me, Thea?@0003
@000CWell, you've been retired
for a while now...@0003
I'm sure you're not too rusty,
but anything can happen.@0003
I was a little worried.@0003
@0009@0017Thanks... But I'm fine.@0003
How about you?@0003
How is it leading a squad of
pegasus knights?@0003
I know you're responsible, but
did you get along with your squad?@0003
@000C@0017I don't think I was
anything special...@0003
@0017But I probably did
all right.@0003
@0009I'm sure you did fine, Thea.@0003
Good job...@0003
@000C@0017J-Juno!@0003
@0009@0017Oh...@0003
You don't like having
your head pet anymore?@0003
You used to love it.@0003
@000C@0017Th-that was a long time ago...
I'm not...a kid anymore.@0003
@0009So you don't like it
anymore?@0003
@000CIt's not that I don't
like it, but...you know...@0003
[0481]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0128@000C@0017Juno...@0003
@0009@0017Thea?
What's the matter?@0003
@000C@0017Nothing.@0003
I was just wondering whether
you're all right...@0003
@0009@0017Wait, Thea, before you go,
let's chat a little.@0003
@000C@0017Um...but...@0003
@0009@0017It's OK, Thea.@0003
You can still act like a little
sister when we're alone together.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016You're strong,
but I know you get lonely...@0003@0002
Do you remember the time I first
left for pegasus knight training?@0003
You thought I was leaving
forever, and you--@0003
@000C@0017D-don't bring that up...!@0003
I was still a little girl...@0003
@0009@0017I was glad you cared so much
about me, Thea.@0003
You were always so blunt, so I
sometimes thought you didn't like me.@0003
@000C@0017That's silly...@0003
@0009@0017But...you cried so much when I left.
"Don't leave us, Juno!"@0003
I almost cried myself.@0003
@000C@0017Juno...@0003
@0009@0017Thea, if you ever feel
down, come talk to me.@0003
Because...I'll always be
your big sister.@0003
@000CYeah...@0003
[0482]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0128@000CJuno?@0003
@0009Yes?@0003
@000CI was thinking...@0003
Maybe you should leave the rest of
the battle to us and rest a bit.@0003
I know you're a mother now, so...@0003
@0009Oh? Are you saying
I've lost my edge?@0003
@000C@0017N-no, that's not what I mean.
I just...@0003
@0009@0017I know, Thea. Thank you.@0003
But I'm fine. I am still a
pegasus knight of Ilia.@0003
I'm the one who taught you how to
ride a pegasus in the first place.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I know, but...@0003
@0017@0016......@0003@0016
If anything happens...@0003
I'll be here for you,
Juno.@0003
@0009I know...
Thank you, Thea.@0003
[0483]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0129@000CIt's Juno!@0003
@0009Shanna.
Have you been well?@0003
@000CYeah!
Really well.@0003
@0009It's already been a year since
you left for training...@0003
Are you getting along with
the other mercenaries?@0003
I heard they were all men.
Are you doing all right?@0003
@000CYeah, I'm doing fine!
They're all really nice.@0003
And I'm doing really well
in battle, too!@0003
I do all the work,
actually.@0003
@0009Really?@0003
@000CYeah!@0003
After we joined Lord Roy, the
enemies started getting stronger...@0003
But still I beat all of them
single-handed!@0003
@0009Wow... That's amazing.@0003
You've been working hard,
Shanna...@0003
@000CTee hee...@0003
[0484]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0129@000CJuno!@0003
@0009What is it,
Shanna?@0003
@000CTeach me how to ride a
pegasus like you.@0003
The way you fly is really neat.
I wish I could fly like that...@0003
@0009@0017I'd like to, but not now.
We're in a battle.@0003
I can teach you when we
have some free time...@0003
@000C...Oh.@0003
@0017Then let's practice
our special move!@0003
@0009Special move...?@0003
@000CThe Triangle Attack!@0003
@0009Oh, that move mother used
to tell us about...@0003
@0017But we need Thea to do
the Triangle Attack.@0003
@000COh... Right.
@0017Then, um...@0003
@0009What's the matter,
Shanna?@0003
@000CWe haven't seen each
other for so long.@0003
I just don't want us to
be separated again...@0003
@0009...You always used to cling to me
like that when you were little.@0003
Shanna, be a good girl and wait
until the war is over.@0003
Then we can spend as much time
together as we like...@0003
@000CYeah... You're right.
OK!@0003
[0485]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0129
@000CJuno!@0003
@0009Shanna, I haven't had a chance
to tell you yet, but...@0003
@000CYeah?@0003
@0009While you were away,
we had a baby girl.@0003
@000CWhat?! You had a baby
with Zelot?!@0003
Where, where?!
I want to hold her...@0003
@0009I can't bring a baby to the
battlefield, Shanna.@0003
She's with a friend back home.
You can see her when we go back.@0003
@000COh boy! Juno's baby...
I bet she's super cute!@0003
I really want to see her.@0003
@0009Don't worry.
You will.@0003
@000CBut wait a second...
My sister had a baby?@0003
That makes me...an aunt?
I'm too young to be an aunt!@0003
[0486]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0132@000C@0017Juno, er...@0003
@0009@0017Yes?
What is it, Zelot?@0003
@000C@0017Our daughter...
Is she all right?@0003
@0009@0017Yes, I'm sure she is.@0003
I've entrusted her to
a close friend.@0003
@000C@0017Oh. Good...@0003
@0009@0017Is something wrong?@0003
@000C@0017No, it's just...
What's she like?@0003
Does she look like you?
Does she have my nose?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, you haven't seen her yet,
have you?@0003
@000C@0017No, I've been out working.@0003
@0009@0017Let's go see her together
when the war ends.@0003
@000C@0017Yes... I would like that.@0003
[0487]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0132@000C@0017Juno, I've been thinking...@0003
@0009@0017Yes?@0003
@000C@0017I don't think it's good to leave
our newborn baby with someone else.@0003
You should go back home so you can
take care of her.@0003
@0009@0017It's all right.@0003
I trust my friend to take
excellent care of her.@0003
@000C@0017But she needs her
mother's love.@0003
@0009@0017I fight precisely because
I'm her mother.@0003
I want her to grow up
without war and conflict.@0003
@000C@0017But...@0003
@0009I think I've told you before,@0003
but nowhere is safe until
this war ends.@0003
@000CWell, that's certainly true...@0003
@0009@0017So I think we should focus all
our effort on ending this war.@0003
Can you accept that, Zelot?@0003
@000C@0017Hm...@0003
[0488]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0132@0009You're coming back to Edessa
once the war ends, aren't you?@0003
@000C@0017Of course.@0003
@0009Will you stay with
us after that?@0003
@000CI don't think that's possible...@0003
I'll need to lead the mercenary knights
to more work opportunities as before.@0003
We can't support ourselves otherwise.@0003
@0009But most of Ilia's land can
grow food now.@0003
With enough effort, we can
produce enough food to get by...@0003
@000CThat won't happen overnight.@0003
@0009I know, but...@0003
@000CBesides, who can guarantee a good
harvest every single year?@0003
Were our crops to fail, how would
we get money?@0003
How would we survive the winter if
we're not prepared for failure?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016I must lead the mercenary knights to
make money,@0003
at least until we can support ourselves
even after a bad harvest.@0003
I'll leave Edessa to you, so keep doing
what you can to cultivate the land.@0003
@0009I will...@0003
@000C@0017I have faith that there will come a time
when Ilia will be self-sufficient.@0003
@0009Yes, I think so, too.@0003
I know that someday you won't have
to leave us anymore.@0003
That we'll finally be together as
a family.@0003
[0489]
@000C@0010@0127Trec?@0003
@0017Oh... He was here just
a minute ago...@0003
Hm?@0003
What's this paper...?
Did he drop it?@0003
It has a lot of
writing on it...@0003
Let's see...@0003
"I was a horse."@0003
"I tried running."@0003
"I got tired."@0003
...What is this?@0003
[048A]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@0127@000COh, Trec.
I was looking for you.@0003
@0009Oh, hullo,
Lady Juno.@0003
@000CYou look as sleepy as always.@0003
Oh, right... Here.@0003
Is this yours?@0003
@0009Huh?@0003
Ah...
Yeah, it's mine.@0003
I lost it the
other day.@0003
@000CI thought so.@0003
I'm sorry, but I read a
little bit of it...@0003
What are you writing
about?@0003
@0009I write down the
dreams I have.@0003
@000CDreams?@0003
@0009Yes. When I look at what
I wrote,@0003
I remember all the kinds of
dreams I've had.@0003
It helps me sleep better.@0003
Yawn...@0003
@000COh, I see.
That sounds interesting...@0003
Maybe I should try it, too.@0003
[048B]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@0127
@000CTrec?@0003
@0009Yes?@0003
@000CCan you show me that paper
with your dreams on it?@0003
I'm very interested in it.@0003
@0009Uhm... Sure.@0003
@000CThank you.@0003@0002
"I was praised by Commander Zelot."@0003
He shows up in your dreams, too?@0003
@0009Yeah, sometimes.@0003
@000CLet's see...@0003
"The war ended."@0003
"There was peace."@0003
"Spring came to Ilia."@0003
"Everyone slept happily
ever after..."@0003
@0016......@0003@0016
@0009Huh?@0003
Is something wrong,
Lady Juno?@0003
@000C...No, I'm sorry.@0003
@0016......@0003@0016
Can you show me your dreams
again sometime, Trec?@0003
@0009Well...@0003
It's a little embarrassing,
to tell the truth.@0003
But OK, you can see them.@0003
I'll sleep as much as I can and
show you all the latest ones.@0003
@000CThank you, Trec.@0003
[048C]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0130@0009Oh, Noah.@0003
@000CHello, Lady Juno.@0003
Are you all right?@0003
@0009You're worried about me?@0003
That's a surprise.@0003
@000C@0017...I'm not that antisocial,
Lady Juno...@0003
@0009@0017I was just kidding.@0003
You seem uncaring, but I know
you have a kind heart.@0003
Are you holding up OK?@0003
You've gone through many
battles to make it here.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, I'm fine.@0003
Commander Zelot
helped us greatly.@0003
@0017It's thanks to him I'm
still alive now.@0003
@0009@0017I see...@0003
He always works himself
too hard in battle...@0003
[048D]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0130@0009@0017Sigune...
She turned to Bern.@0003
@000CYes, she ambushed us in the blizzard
with her pegasus knights.@0003
@0009I see...@0003
Sigune and I used to be
rivals, you know.@0003
We were always competing
against each other.@0003
It all seems so...distant
when I think about it now.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Sigune always tried to act tough, but
she was a kindhearted person inside.@0003
I just wish it hadn't come to this...@0003
War creates so much pain.@0003
@000C...Yes.
But that's war.@0003
[048E]
@0009@0010@0127@000C@0010@0130@0009@0017Noah.@0003
@000CYes?@0003
@0009You seem to avoid developing
close relationships.@0003
Is it because you don't want
to suffer from loss?@0003
@000C...I don't know.@0003
It's just easier to avoid getting
close with anyone.@0003
The tighter the bond, the greater your
suffering when that bond is broken.@0003
...I think you know that better
than any of us.@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
Perhaps in Ilia it's better
to live the way you do.@0003
But someday you'll realize
relationships aren't so bad.@0003
Maybe all you need is to
fall in love.@0003
[048F]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0129@000CHey! Sister!@0003
@0009@0017...Shanna, this is a
battlefield.@0003
What if an archer heard
you screaming like that?@0003
@000C@0017Don't worry.
No archer can hit me.@0003
@0009@0017...Sigh...@0003
...Shanna, where are your reins?@0003
You could fall off your
pegasus without them.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I took them off.@0003
@0009@0017You took them off?@0003
Shanna, you never know
what can happen.@0003
So considering all the
possibilities, I think...@0003
@000C@0017You worry too much, Thea!@0003
Flying is more fun without
all the extra gear.@0003@0002
See ya!@0003@0011
@0009@0017Shanna, wait!
I'm not finished yet...@0003@0002
...Sigh.@0003
[0490]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0129@000C@0017Thea... You're starting
to get annoying...@0003
@0009I worry for your sake.@0003
If you won't listen to
your big sister,@0003
I won't let you ride that
pegasus anymore.@0003
@000CWhat?!
But...@0003
@0009Shanna, you brought this
upon yourself.@0003
@000CYou're always like that!@0003
Always saying everything's
my fault...@0003
You could say it...
a little nicer...@0003
@0009I can't!
If I did, you wouldn't--@0003
@000CNo!
I hate you!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C......@0003
@0009@0016Shanna...
Um...@0003
@000CW-what the--?!
What are you doing?!@0003
@0009Juno...used to pet our heads
like this, didn't she?@0003
I'm your big sister, too...@0003
So I thought I should try
to make you feel better...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Shanna, I'm sorry...@0003
I don't know how to be
kind like Juno...@0003
@000CThea...@0003
...Did you take a hit to
the head or something?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
Why, you...@0003
Fine, I don't care anymore.@0003
You can fend for yourself
from now on!@0003@0011
@000C@0017Hey, wait! Sorry!@0003
It just slipped out...@0003
[0491]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0129@000CHey! Thea!@0003
@0009@0017...What?@0003
@000C@0017I'm sorry about before.@0003
But I was really happy that
you care so much.@0003
I love you, Sister!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@0017...How can you say that without
turning red...?@0003
I envy you sometimes...@0003
@000C@0017What about you?
Do you love me, too?@0003
@0009@0017...There's no need to say
it out loud...@0003
@000CYou...don't love me...?@0003
@0009It's just that...@0003
We don't have to say it here,
in the middle of...@0003
@000COh... I...
I never knew.@0003
Thea... You never
loved me...@0003
@0009All right, all right!
I love you!@0003
@0017Of course I love you.
You're my only little sister.@0003
I'll...I'll always care
for you.@0003
@000CTee hee... Thanks!
See you!@0003@0011
@0009Why, you...@0003
[0492]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0132@0009@0017Commander Zelot, I'm sure you're
aware, but my mission is complete.@0003
Regardless, I wish to remain with
this army.@0003
@000CVery well.@0003
You know, fate works in
strange ways.@0003
We were hired by the Lycian Army,
and you were hired by Etruria...@0003
I never thought we would be
fighting together.@0003
@0009Yes, it is strange indeed.@0003
Etruria didn't seem to view us highly,
but Commander Klein was caring.@0003
@000CThe important thing is
that you're safe...@0003
Juno was pretty worried about
you and Shanna, you know.@0003
Knowing you, I knew you'd
be all right.@0003
But you know Juno.
She's a worrier.@0003
@0009Yes, I know that all
too well.@0003
Juno often spoiled
Shanna and me.@0003
The day we left was a
hectic one indeed.@0003
Juno fretted over us
so much.@0003
Over our meals, and
our clothes...@0003
@000C@0017Ha ha, that's Juno.@0003
[0493]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0132
@000C@0017I was wondering...@0003
Juno's... Your parents...
What were they like?@0003
@0009Juno never told you?@0003
@000CNo. All I know is that
they were soldiers.@0003
@0009Yes, our mother was a pegasus knight.@0003
Our parents were killed together on the
battlefield when we were young.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016We had no other relatives to
turn to...@0003
So Juno became our mother when
she was still a teenager...@0003
@000CIt must have been difficult.@0003
@0009Ordinary girls her age concern
themselves with romance,@0003
but Juno took on the role of
mother.@0003
She never complained, though...@0003
She always looked after us...
with a smile on her face.@0003
That's why...@0003
That's why I always wanted
Juno to find happiness.@0003
[0494]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0132
@000C...I have to thank you for
helping us with the wedding.@0003
You set up the location and
made a wonderful feast...@0003
Oh, and Juno was very pleased with
the gift from you and Shanna.@0003
@0009Really...?@0003
I actually didn't want
to give it...@0003
But Shanna never listens
once she's made up her mind.@0003
@000CHa ha ha...
It was an interesting gift.@0003
But...I want to apologize to Juno.@0003
If only I...@0003
If only our nation had more
to give,@0003
she could have had a proper,
elegant wedding...@0003
@0009@0017I doubt Juno feels that
way at all.@0003
@0017I'm very grateful to you,
Commander Zelot.@0003
Your wedding...@0003
I'd never seen Juno
look happier.@0003
I thank you for all
you've done for her.@0003
[0495]
@0009@0010@0129@000C@0010@0132@0009Zelot!@0003
@000C@0017Shanna.@0003
@0009@0017Hey, Zelot...@0003
@0017Oh, hey, you're my brother now
since you're Juno's husband...@0003
@000C@0017Yes, you may call me
"Brother" if you wish.@0003
@0009Oh, right!@0003
I wanted to ask you
something.@0003
How did you meet Juno?@0003
@000C@0017Well...
Perhaps some other time.@0003
@0009@0017Why not now?@0003
Don't be mean.
Come on, tell me!@0003
@000C@0017It's not my intention to be mean...@0003
You'll understand when you're older,@0003
but that's not a question you
should ask another...@0003
@0009@0017But I really want to know...@0003
I think I have a right to
know as your sister...@0003
@000C@0011
@0009Zelot?
Wait!@0003
[0496]
@0009@0010@0129@000C@0010@0132@0009Zelot!@0003
@000C@0017...You won't let me go,
will you?@0003
@0009@0017We're family.
I want to know everything...@0003
@000C@0017Hm...@0003
Very well, I suppose...@0003
...We first met in battle
in Etruria.@0003
Juno's pegasus squad was
hired by our enemy.@0003
@0009Whoa...@0003
@000CWe decided to settle the dispute
peacefully through diplomacy.@0003
Juno was a beautiful and caring
woman, so things went well.@0003
We got to know each other,
and it progressed after that.@0003
@0009@0017What did you say
when you proposed?@0003
@000C@0017Y-you want to know
that, too?@0003
@0009@0017Of course.@0003
We're family...aren't we?@0003
@000C@0017Er...@0003
@0009@0017So did you propose?
Or was it Juno?@0003
@000C@0017Well...@0003
[0497]
@0009@0010@0129@000C@0010@0132
@0009I'm glad you're
a good guy.@0003
You and Juno look
perfect together.@0003
@000CThank you.@0003
I'm relieved you
don't hate me.@0003
@0009Why would I hate you?
You're strong, you're kind...@0003
And Juno loves you.@0003
@000C@0017By the way...tell me
about yourself.@0003
Are there any men you
have in mind?@0003
@0009@0017Sorry, that's a secret!@0003
@000C@0017W-what?@0003
After making me tell you so much,
you won't do the same for me?@0003
@0009@0017We're family.@0003
Family have to keep
secrets from each other!@0003
@000C@0017W-wait, Shanna...@0003
@0009@0017See ya!@0003
[0498]
@000C@0010@012A@0005@0009@0010@012E@0017Zeiss!
Behind you!@0003
@000C@0016!!@0003@0016
@0009@0080@000CBlast...!@0003
@000A@0011@000C@0011@0007
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@012A
@000C...I'm sorry, Melady.@0003
I was too focused on the
enemies in front of me.@0003
@0009@0017Don't worry about it.@0003
Galle often looked out for me
like this, too.@0003
If we can survive by helping each
other out, then that's fine by me.@0003
@000C@0017But I need to learn to
defend myself on my own...@0003
@0009@0017You're still inexperienced.@0003
It's all right. I'll watch your
back until you're strong enough.@0003
@000C@0017...Thanks.@0003@0009@0011@0007
@000CBut no... I can't accept that.@0003
I must become strong enough
to protect her, too...!@0003
[0499]
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@012A@0009@0017Zeiss!
Slow down!@0003
You have to be
more careful!@0003
@000CI got him!@0003
@0009...Don't rush like that!@0003
You were lucky you
defeated him...@0003
@000CYeah, well... The point
is I beat him.@0003
It's all right, Melady.
I was fine.@0003
@0009But who can say that you'll
be so lucky next time?!@0003
@000C...It wasn't luck.@0003
@0009Zeiss...@0003
Just listen to your older sister.@0003
I would never be able to forgive myself
if I let something happen to you...@0003
@000C...You don't trust me,
do you?@0003
Am I so weak that you
can't even rely on me?@0003
@0009Zeiss, I'm not saying that.@0003
Stop being a child.@0003
@000CThen...stop treating
me like one!@0003@0011
@0009Zeiss!@0003@0002
...Why...?@0003
[049A]
@000D@0010@012E@000D@0017That's it!@0003
@000B@0010@012AMelady!@0003@001C
@000D@0016!!@0003@0016@001C
@000B@0011@000D@0011@0007
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@012A
@0009Zeiss!@0003
What were you thinking, taking
a blow for me like that?!@0003
@000C...Even you forget to pay attention
to the enemies around you sometimes.@0003
Are you all right?@0003
@0009I'm fine... What about you, Zeiss?
Aren't you hurt?@0003
@000CIt's just a scratch.
Melady, your arm is bleeding...@0003
Hang on, I'll go get
some vulneraries...@0003
@0009Zeiss!@0003
@000CYeah?@0003
@0009...Thanks for saving me.@0003
@000CYou don't need to thank me.@0003@0011
@0009@0017...Little Zeiss, coming to my rescue?@0003
He's matured so quickly...@0003
It's no wonder he got angry when
I treated him like a child.@0003
[049B]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0134@000CP...Prince Myrddin...?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Your Highness!
You're alive?!@0003
@0009@0017...You must have me mistaken
for someone else.@0003
I am Elffin...
A simple bard.@0003
@000C@0017But you...!@0003
No, it can't be...@0003
@0009@0017Excuse me?@0003
@000C@0017Nothing...@0003
@0009@0017...Then I shall be off.@0003@0011
@000C@0017...He...@0003
He looks just like him...
...He looks exactly like...@0003
[049C]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0134@000C@0017Elffin!@0003
@0009@0017...Can I help you,
General Cecilia?@0003
@000C@0017Have you ever been
to Etruria?@0003
@0009Not yet...@0003
I traveled through the Western Isles
before I joined this army.@0003
@000CThen do you know of the
three Etrurian Generals?@0003
@0009@0017...Yes, I do.@0003
There is you, the Mage General,@0003
and then there are the Knight
General and the Great General.@0003
@000CYou are very knowledgeable.@0003
@0009It is my job as a bard
to know such things.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0017You insist on continuing
this farce, don't you?@0003
Then I have an idea.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000C@0017Show me your right shoulder that you
are conveniently hiding with your hair.@0003@0017
If you are but a simple bard as
you say,@0003
then there won't be a scar from
a magic attack.@0003
May I have a look...?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016@0017...Persistent, aren't you, Cecilia?@0003
@000CIt is you, Prince Myrddin!@0003
What happened?@0003
Why did you not tell me that
you were alive?@0003
@0009@0017...I did not want you
caught up in this.@0003
But now it seems you're
involved as well.@0003
[049D]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0134@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009@0017Cecilia...@0003
How much longer are you
going to stay mad?@0003
@000C@0017I understand why you were hiding
your identity from me, my prince.@0003
@0009@0017Thank you, Cecilia.@0003
@000C@0017
But Your Highness, you told
General Douglas.@0003
Did you lack trust in me?@0003
@0009@0017That's not why...@0003
@000CI'll let it go for now,
Your Highness.@0003
Though I expect an explanation
after the war is over.@0003
@0009@0017...As intimidating as always.@0003
@000C@0017In this situation, yes.@0003
You have brought grief not just
to me, but to your people as well.@0003
Please show our people that you
live, Your Highness.@0003
@0017Please...@0003
@0009Yes...
I will, Cecilia.@0003
[049E]
@000C@0010@0135@0009@0010@012C@0009Hey, you're a
pirate, right?@0003
@000CUh, yeah... I guess.@0003
@0017That was your first
thought, huh? Man...@0003
@0009Something wrong?@0003
@000C@0017I used to be a seafaring
merchant.@0003
@0009Really? You must've made a lot
of money, then. Lucky you.@0003
Us poor folk gotta keep breaking
our backs, I guess... See ya.@0003
@000C@0017Wait.@0003
@0009@0017Huh?@0003
@000C@0017What's my bag doing
in your hand?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
S-some eye you've got.@0003
@000C@0017Gee, thanks.
Now give it back.@0003
@0009Fine...@0003
But there's no treasure I
can't steal!@0003
Be on your guard, for you
never know when I'll strike!@0003
[049F]
@000C@0010@0135@0009@0010@012C@0009
Hey, Geese...@0003
@000C@0017You again?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, Geese...I can't keep
it hidden any longer...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016I'm madly in love with you!
Please hold me...@0003
@000C@0017...Hey.@0003
@0009@0017Uh, yeah?@0003
@000C@0017Were you hit with a berserk
staff or something?@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
@000C@0017You're a lousy actor.
Why are you even trying?@0003
@0009What?!@0003
You saw through my seduction skills?!
I should have given you more credit!@0003
@000CGee, thanks.@0003
But I'm not really the lovey-dovey
type. That won't work on me.@0003
You'll need to think of another
way to rob me.@0003
@0009I-I knew that!
This was just a test!@0003
@0017But next time's for real.
You won't know what hit ya!@0003
Your stuff is mine!@0003
@000C@0017Sure it is.
Good luck with that.@0003
[04A0]
@000C@0010@0135@0009@0010@012C@0009Geese!@0003
@000C@0017Yeah?@0003
@0009@0017Does this look familiar?@0003
@000C@0017Hey, that's my...@0003
@0009@0017Heh heh!@0003
Guess you weren't so
good after all!@0003
There's no treasure
I can't steal!@0003
@000C@0017Sigh...@0003
@0009@0017
Well, let's see now.
What have we got in here?@0003
@0016............
............@0003@0016@0017
What...what the
heck is this?!@0003
It's nothing but
worthless junk!@0003
@000CIt's not junk.
Maps, compasses...@0003
It's sailing
equipment.@0003
@0009But what about treasure?!
Where's your treasure?!@0003
@000C@0017Ha ha ha, I never had
any treasure!@0003
I'm broke.@0003
Drowning in debt,
to tell the truth.@0003
I've got nothing
worth stealing!@0003
@0009@0017Grr... Wipe that smile 
off your face!@0003
Being broke is nothing
to be proud of!@0003
@000C@0017It's OK. I've got a dream.@0003
I'm gonna go back to being a trader
and hit the jackpot. You'll see.@0003
My ship'll be so full of riches
it'll barely stay afloat.@0003
Maybe then you'll have something
to steal!@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016@0017Did...did I lose?
Are you a big shot?@0003
...Or just an idiot?@0003
[04A1]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@012E@000C@0017You must be one of Ilia's
mercenary knights.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah...
I'm Trec.@0003
@000C@0017I am Melady.
Pleased to meet you.@0003
@0009You're...@0003
@000CYes... I am a wyvern rider from
Bern, as you can probably tell.@0003
@0009@0017Oh, I see.@0003
@000C@0017How...how do you feel about fighting
alongside a knight from Bern?@0003
@0009@0017Well...@0003
Whatever.@0003
@000C@0017Wh...whatever?@0003
@0009@0017It's not like people from Bern
have seven ears or anything.@0003
@000C@0017@0016......@0003@0016
Well, no, I have only two.@0003
@0009@0017Exactly.@0003
We're all brothers
and sisters.@0003
@000C@0017Do...you think so?@0003
@0009@0017Uh-huh.@0003
[04A2]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@012E@0009Ahh...
That hurt.@0003
@000C@0017Is something wrong,
Sir Trec?@0003
@0009Hm?@0003
Oh, what's your
name again...?@0003
@000CMelady.@0003
Is something wrong?@0003
@0009@0017Well...@0003
I was just sitting here
watching you fight.@0003
@000C@0017You were watching me fight?@0003
@0009Yeah...
My neck hurts now.@0003
@000C@0017I...see.@0003
@0009Yeah. And the way you fight
made me think...@0003
Do you have any loved
ones in Bern?@0003
Like family or a lover
or something?@0003
@000C...N-no, I'm all alone.
I live for Princess Guinivere...@0003
@0009@0017Oh, OK.
Yeah, that figures.@0003
I'm usually wrong.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016@0017Oh well, guess I hurt
my neck for nothing.@0003
[04A3]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@012E@0009Oh, what's your
name again...?@0003
@000C@0017...Melady.@0003
Do you always forget
people's names?@0003
@0009@0017It's my hobby.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016You are an odd individual,
Sir Trec.@0003
@0009Do you think so?@0003
I think I'm pretty normal.@0003
Everyone always tells me
I look so carefree.@0003
But I have concerns too,
you know.@0003
@000COh?
Like what?@0003
@0009Well, the other day
I dreamed I was a horse.@0003
@000C@0017...A horse.@0003
@0009@0017I think this dream has some kind
of hidden meaning somewhere...@0003
It's been keeping me up for
some time now.@0003
It's gotten to the point that
I can only sleep at night.@0003
@000C...Thank you,
Sir Trec.@0003
@0009Huh?@0003
@000CI feel a little better now.@0003
@0009Really?
Why's that?@0003
[04A4]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@012F@0009Whoa.@0003
@000CUh?@0003
@0009Hey, what's your name?@0003
@000C@0017Gonzalez.@0003
@0009@0017Gonzalez? You're huge.
And look at your muscles.@0003
You must be able to pull trees
right out of the ground.@0003
@000C@0017I...?@0003
@0009@0017Hm, this is quite a find.@0003
There's no way that I'm
letting you get away.@0003
@000C@0017Uh...
What?@0003
@0016......@0016@0003
...I get away now.@0003
@0009Hey, wait!@0003
[04A5]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@012F@0009@0017Oh.@0003
@000CUh...@0003
@0009@0017Wait, don't leave!
I need a favor from you.@0003
@000C@0017...Me?@0003
@0009@0017Yes, I need you.@0003
I'm going to help build a new
village in the Western Isles.@0003
@000C@0017Village...@0003
@0009@0017There are lots of people who
lost their homes in the war.@0003
Even many people in the
resistance force are homeless now.@0003
@000C@0017Lost their home...@0003
@0009@0017I'm going to build a village
for those people.@0003
But I can't do it on my own.@0003
What I really need is big,
strong men like you.@0003
What do you say?
You'll get free meals.@0003
@000C@0017But...I ugly...@0003
I not be with people.
People hate me...@0003
@0009@0017Ha ha, don't be ridiculous.@0003
Help them out by carrying a couple
logs and everyone'll love you.@0003
@000C@0017Love me...?@0003@0002
@0017I help you.@0003
[04A6]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@012F@0009Hey again.@0003
@000C@0017Uh...@0003
What...
What your name?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, right. I never
told you, did I?@0003
I'm--@0003
@000C@0017No... I stupid.
I not remember...@0003
...And I ugly. Everyone stare
at me... I ugly and stupid...@0003
@0009...Oh dear.
Gonzalez, all you need is confidence.@0003
Maybe you're not the most handsome guy,
and maybe you're no genius.@0003
But so what?@0003
@000CUh...?@0003
@0009Look, Gonzalez.
I'll be frank with you.@0003
You've got a good heart,
but you're ugly as sin.@0003
That's why people make
fun of you.@0003
@000CUh...@0003
@0009But that's no reason to
give up.@0003@0017
Everyone has strong points
and weak points.@0003
Find something unique
to you.@0003
@000C@0017Unique...@0003
@0009@0017Right. Unique to you.@0003
Once you do that, no one will
make fun of you anymore.@0003
You'll have no reason to think
so lowly of yourself.@0003
You can stand proud, with both
your strong points and weak points.@0003
@000CU...unique...?@0003
@0016......@0003@0016
@0017I think later.@0006
My head hurt.@0003
@0009@0017Ha ha ha...
Take all the time you need.@0003
[04A7]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0131@0009@0017Hngh?@0003
@000C@0017Hm...?
Who are you?@0003
@0009@0017Me?
I...I Gonzalez.@0003
@000C@0017Gonzalez?
That's a nice name...@0003
@0009@0017R-really?@0003
@000C@0017I'm Trec.
Nice to meet you.@0003
@0009@0017T...T...?@0003
@000C@0017Trec.@0003
@0009@0017Trec, Trec, Trec, Trec, Tre...@0003
@000C@0017Ha ha, you don't need to
say it so many times.@0003
@0009@0017Quiet.
I forget.@0003
...Cret, Cret, Cret...@0005
OK, I remember.@0003
@000C@0017Ha ha, you're an odd one.
Say, do you think you--@0003
@0017Sorry, what was
your name again?@0003
[04A8]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0131@0009@0017Uh?@0003
You...@0003
@000CHm...?@0003
@0009Who you?
I see you before.@0003
@000C@0017Really?
I must be famous.@0003
My name is Trec.@0003
@0009@0017Tr...Tr...
Tr--@0003
@000C--rec.@0003
@0009Rec.@0003
@000C@0017Yep... So hey,
what's your name?@0003
@0009@0017I Gonzalez.@0003
@000C@0017Gonzalez?
That's a nice name...@0003
@0009@0017R-really?@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, it has kind of
a calm air to it...@0003
@0009@0017Calm...@0003
What calm...?@0003
@000C@0017Hm? ...Hmm...@0003
You know, I don't
really know either.@0003
But hey, don't worry
about it.@0003
It doesn't matter much
in the grand scheme.@0003
[04A9]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0131@000C@0017Ahhh...@0003
@0009Uh?@0003
@000C@0017It's so peaceful here...@0003
I think we could make a
good team, you and me.@0003
Uh, but what's your...?@0003
@0009@0017Gonzalez.@0003
@000C@0017Gonzalez?
That's a nice name...@0003
Oh yeah, my name is...@0003
@0009@0017You Rec.@0003
@000C@0017Hm? Am I?@0003
Oh yeah, you're right. Rec.
That sounds like my name.@0003
Well, whatever.
Let's go.@0003
@0009Ugh.@0003
[04AA]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0130@000C@0017Commander Zelot,
are you all right?@0003
@0009Ah, Noah.@0003
This is nothing.
We are knights of Ilia.@0003
We have more experience than
the knights of any other nation.@0003
@000CYes, but I still have
a lot to learn.@0003
@0009Humble. Good.@0003
...Oh.@0003
Noah, have you written
your letter yet?@0003
@000CLetter?
Oh... That letter.@0003
@0009Surely you remember what you
were told when you first enlisted.@0003
There are pegasus knight
messengers that fly with us.@0003
Should you fall in battle, they
will deliver our letters for us.@0003
@000CYes, I remember.@0003
@0009Neither of us will have
peaceful deaths.@0003
We need those letters.@0003
Noah, don't you have anyone
to send that letter to?@0003
@000CActually...not really.@0003
I do recall the others
writing letters, though.@0003
They addressed them to
their parents...or lovers.@0003
@0009You should do the same.@0003
Why don't you get a
girlfriend?@0003
@000CI'll think about it.@0003
[04AB]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0130@000C@0017...Commander Zelot.@0003
@0009Is this about the letter?@0003
Have you changed your mind?@0003
@000CYes, I suppose even I have someone
I want to send a letter to when I die.@0003
It's you.@0003
@0009Me?@0003
@000CTrec and I...
And Grant and Sieks...@0003
We've all made it this
far thanks to you.@0003
I want to express my
gratitude to you when I die.@0003
@0009...I see.@0003
@000CSpeaking of those two...
I wonder where they are now.@0003
@0009I've no idea.@0003
But I instructed them well.
They won't die so easily.@0003
@000CI heard that some people we used
to work with were hired by Bern...@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
But such is the life of a
mercenary.@0003
We give our blood and get
money in return.@0003
@000C...Commander Zelot,
what do you think of that?@0003
@0009Of what?@0003
@000CNobles from other nations say
that Ilia sells death for a living.@0003
They say that we're vultures.
That we prey on blood and decaying flesh.@0003
@0009It doesn't bother me.@0003
We both know that Ilia couldn't
survive without war.@0003
We give our own blood to
survive.@0003
@000CThat's true.@0003
[04AC]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0130
@000C@0017Commander Zelot?@0003
Is something wrong?@0003
@0009Ah, Noah.@0003
No... Nothing's wrong.
Did I seem troubled?@0003
@000CNot at all.@0003
I just thought that something
might have happened.@0003
@0009...A letter arrived today.
It was your friend's...@0003
Grant's.@0003
@000C...I see.@0003
@0009Would you like to read it?@0003
@000C...Not now.@0003
@0009All right.
Then let's go.@0003
@000CYes, sir.@0003
[04AD]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@0130@0009...Zzz...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016...Uh...@0003
Oh, Noah...
I didn't notice you there.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, I've been standing here for
a while now.@0003
I'm used to it, so I don't mind
you falling asleep every ten seconds.@0003
But you know, don't you have anything
else to do?@0003
@0009@0017Like what?@0003
@000C@0017Like practicing your
swings or something.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah, well...
What about you?@0003
Have you been doing
anything like that?@0003
@000C@0017Me?
...Not really.@0003
...I guess I'm no
different from you.@0003
So, what did you do back
in Ilia during our vacation?@0003
@0009@0017I slept.@0003
@000C@0017I mean other than that.@0003
@0009@0017I didn't do...
Oh, actually, I went fishing.@0003
You know how the lakes freeze over in
the winter?@0003
You can punch a hole in the ice with your
lance and lower some string inside.@0003
@000CSounds appropriate
for you.@0003
What did you catch?@0003
@0009Nothing.@0003
I had plenty of fun just sitting there
staring into space holding the string.@0003
@000C...You really live life
to the fullest.@0003
@0009And what did you do?@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0016@0017...Nothing, really.@0003
[04AE]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@0130@000CTrec, do you remember Cassis?@0003
@0009Cassis?@0003
Hmm...@0003
Sounds familiar...@0003
@000C@0017You don't remember him?@0003
He's the guy that forgot to bring
his weapons to our first mission.@0003
@0009Oh, right!@0003
I remember Commander Zelot yelled at
him even more than he yelled at me.@0003
He even forgot to bring his horse,
you know.@0003
He was fighting on foot!@0003
I couldn't believe there was someone
dumber than me in our squad.@0003
@000C@0017Well, he's dead now.@0003
He was hired by Bern...
He fell somewhere nearby.@0003
@0009...Oh.@0003
@000CMercenaries are in high demand
right now...@0003
We could have ended up fighting
him if we had been unlucky.@0003
@0009Yeah, well...@0003
@0017We're sellswords.
It happens.@0003
@000C@0017I guess you're right...@0003
I envy that carefree personality
of yours sometimes...@0003
[04AF]
@0009@0010@0131@000C@0010@0130
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Hmm?
Something wrong, Noah?@0003
@000C@0017No...@0003
I was just thinking
some things over.@0003
@0009@0017Thinking things over?
Don't bother.@0003
Humans aren't meant to think
deeply like that.@0003
@000C@0017...Maybe.@0003
But you know, this war...@0003
I mean, I never wanted to go out
and save the world or anything,@0003
but look how many battles we've
been through.@0003
@0009@0017Yeah.@0003
@000C@0017But no matter what we've done,
Ilia's still the same.@0003
Our children, and our children's
children...@0003
They'll be fighting to make a living,
just like we do.@0003
I was just wondering...
Can't we do anything about that?@0003
@0009@0017I wonder...@0003
@000C@0017Maybe it's useless for us
to try and make a difference...@0003
@0009@0017Well... It doesn't really
matter, does it?@0003
@000CWhat...?@0003
@0009I mean, everyone goes through hard times.
Isn't that just part of life?@0003
@000C...Maybe so.@0003
Hey, Trec.@0003
@0009Yeah?@0003
@000CTake me along the next
time you go fishing.@0003
[04B0]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0131@0009@0017Trec.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Trec?@0003
@000C...Zzz...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Oww!@0003
Wh...what the?
Why does my head hurt?@0003
@0009Because I just hit you.@0003
@000CHuh? Commander Zelot?@0003
@0009Trec, you were sleeping
on the job again.@0003
@000CYeah, you got me... Sorry, sir.
I couldn't help it...@0003
Yawn...@0003
@0009You never fail, do you?@0003
You go right to sleep
at any chance.@0003
And what's more, you sleep
with your eyes open.@0003
@000CYeah... Thanks.@0003
@0009I've been meaning to say this for
a long time. You lack discipline.@0003
I'll be checking on you regularly
from now on.@0003
@000CYes, sir...@0003
Yawn...@0003
[04B1]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0131@000C@0017...Zzz...@0003
@0009Trec...@0003
@000C...Zzz...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Owww!@0003
@0017Uh... Commander Zelot?@0003
Yawn...
Good morning, sir.@0003
@0009@0017Trec...@0003
There are rumors about you going
around.@0003
They say that the Ilian knight Trec
swings his sword in his sleep!@0003
@000C@0017I have yet to accomplish such
a feat, sir.@0003
...But that does sound pretty
cool.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0016@0017Trec, you've got talent.
Why don't you do your job properly?@0003
@000CWell...@0003
@0009We are members of the proud
Ilian mercenary knights.@0003
This is a battle that will
determine the fate of the world...@0003
And there's even more.@0003
The reputation of the Ilian mercenary
knights will be affected by our actions.@0003
It all depends upon how we fight in
this battle.@0003
It could have repercussions on the
future of Ilia itself, and thus...@0003
@000C@0017...Zzz...@0003
[04B2]
@0009@0010@0132@000C@0010@0131@0009@0017Trec, are you awake?@0003
@000C@0017Yes, sir.@0003
@0009@0017You are?
That's a pleasant surprise.@0003
@000C@0017Well, I have my moments, sir.@0003
@0009That you do.@0003
Trec...
You've done well.@0003
@000CHuh?@0003
@0009We couldn't have come this far
without you.@0003
We all owe you our lives.@0003
You can sleep as much as you
like from now on.@0003
@000CWow, thanks, sir...@0003
@0009@0011
@000C@0011@0007
@0009@0010@0132@0017...Trec!@0003
@000C@0010@0131
@0009Were you sleeping again?!@0003
@000C@0017Huh? What?
Commander Zelot?@0003
@0009@0017How many times must
I tell you?@0003
You can't keep doing this...@0003
@000C@0017...Good morning to you,
too, sir.@0003
[04B3]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@0135@0009Hey, you.@0003
@000CYeah?@0003
@0009You can sail a ship, right?
I want to ask a favor of you.@0003
@000COf me?@0003
@0009Yeah. I'm planning on building a
new village in the Western Isles.@0003
What I want is for you to use
your ship to carry people there.@0003
I'll pay you well.@0003
@000C@0017...My ship, huh?@0003
@0009@0017What's the matter?
You can sail one, can't you?@0003
@000C...Yeah, that's no problem.@0003
I was once the captain of a
trading vessel.@0003
There's no ocean I haven't
seen.@0003
@0009@0017...Then why did you
become a pirate?@0003
@000C
I couldn't continue my trading
business in this war.@0003
We had no choice, so my mates
and I turned to piracy.@0003
@0009Uh-huh.@0003
@000CBut we were just seafarers
at heart.@0003
We didn't like fighting or
robbing or any of that stuff.@0003
But anyway, the first time
we set sail as pirates,@0003
everyone started complaining
of stomachaches and seasickness.@0003
They were all having second
thoughts about the whole thing.@0003
@0009@0017No gut for piracy, eh?
I'm surprised you made it this far.@0003
@000C@0017Yeah, well, I sure wasn't doing
it because I liked it...@0003
[04B4]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@0135@000C@0017We may have turned to piracy, but
we had no idea what we were doing.@0003
...We figured we'd go for easy
targets first.@0003
We picked a small trading ship
for our first one.@0003
We took over the ship without
much of a fight, but...@0003
@0009@0017But what?@0003
@000C@0017There were no valuables.@0003
The captain of the ship told me he
was in the same situation as us.@0003
He said that he was thinking of
resorting to piracy to get by, too...@0003
@0009@0017What did you do?@0003
@000CWe let them go.@0003
I couldn't rob them
after hearing that.@0003
@0009A pirate with a heart of gold, eh?
I can't imagine you made a good living.@0003
@000C@0017...Yeah, I doubted myself a lot
after that.@0003
But we kept with it and decided to
go after a bigger ship next.@0003
We figured we could steal from the
rich and keep a clean conscience.@0003
Not long after that, we were lucky
and came across a large trading ship.@0003
@0009Yeah?@0003
@000CWe didn't have to hold back
this time.@0003
We charged the ship...@0003
But when we got close, ballistae and
archers flooded out from within.@0003
It was one of Bern's warships.@0003
@0009@0017Yikes.@0003
@000C@0017They fired at us mercilessly and
chased us for three days and nights.@0003
We got away somehow, but our ship
was wrecked.@0003
We hadn't made any money, either.
Some of the boys broke down and cried.@0003
Heck, even I felt like crying after
that disaster.@0003
@0009I can't blame you.@0003
@000CWell, like I said, I wasn't
doing it because I liked it...@0003
[04B5]
@0009@0010@0133@000C@0010@0135@0009Hm?@0003
What's that?
A map?@0003
@000C@0017It's the one treasure I've
gotten as a pirate.@0003
I found it when we were
battling another pirate crew.@0003
@0009@0017I see.@0003
@000C@0017See the skull mark here?@0003
It means buried treasure.@0003
@0009Have you dug it up yet?@0003
@000CNot yet.@0003
Once the war ends, I want to
be a merchant again,@0003
but I have no money to get
started.@0003
If this map is right,@0003@0017
I can dig up the treasure
and repair my ship.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000CI have no money left.@0003
I even went into debt to feed
my mates.@0003
If this map's a fake, then I'll
have to let go of my ship forever.@0003
...I can't help but feel a little
scared when I think of that.@0003
@0009Sure.@0003
@0017But no amount of worrying will
get you that treasure.@0003
You have to take action.@0003
@000C@0017...Yeah.
You're right.@0003
@0009@0017Even if that map's a fake, there
are other treasures out there.@0003
Once you get your ship fixed up,@0003
you'll help us out by carrying the
residents to the new village, right?@0003
I'm counting on you.
Show me your ship sometime.@0003
@000CYou got it.
I won't let you down.@0003
[04B6]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@0122@0009Lilina, is your magic
improving?@0003
@000CYes, I've gotten much better since
you taught me the basics.@0003
@0009Good. You have a special
gift for magic, Lilina.@0003
With enough practice,
you could be unrivaled.@0003
@000C@0017Me...?@0003
@0009@0017Yes. Just make sure you keep
up with your training.@0003
@000CI will!@0003
[04B7]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@0122@000C@0017General Cecilia, why didn't you
teach magic to Roy?@0003
@0009@0017What?@0003
@000CWhen Roy was studying in Ostia,
you wouldn't teach him magic,@0003
no matter how much he asked.@0003
@0009Ah... You're right.
I didn't.@0003
@000C@0017Why not?
You taught me so much.@0003
@0009@0017It's partly because of you.@0003
@000C@0017Because of me?@0003
@0009@0017That's right.@0003
Roy... You know how he is.@0003
If I'd taught him magic, he would
have practiced and practiced.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, that sounds like him.
But...@0003
@0009@0017You see, practice isn't enough to
master a school of magic.@0003
You need talent, and that can't
be obtained through practice.@0003
With another person of such talent
so close to him, what would he think?@0003
He'd work as hard--maybe even harder
than her,@0003
but he would still lag far behind.@0003
What would that do to his confidence?@0003
@000C@0017That person of talent...
Do you mean me?@0003
@0009@0017Everyone has things they excel
at naturally.@0003
It was clear that Roy wouldn't
excel at magic,@0003
so I decided he would be better
off learning the sword instead.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016Lilina, you will lead Ostia someday.
You should remember this...@0003
Assigning someone a task they do
not excel at is a waste of ability.@0003
You must never think that everyone
works in the same way.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, you're right...@0003
[04B8]
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@0122@000CGeneral Cecilia, don't you think
Roy has changed recently?@0003
@0009In what way?@0003
@000CHe's gotten cool-headed...@0003
Or rather, he's more confident when
he gives commands to the army.@0003
@0009Anyone in charge of an army
gains traits like that.@0003
If Roy didn't grow, the army
would be doomed.@0003
@000CGeneral Cecilia, you said before
that I would lead Ostia.@0003
@0009Yes, you are Lord Hector's
only heir after all.@0003
@000C@0017Do you think I could be
like Roy? I mean...@0003
I couldn't even recognize
traitors in my own castle...@0003
@0009@0017People grow according to their
potential.@0003
Even I didn't know what to do at
first when I was made Mage General.@0003
I was taken from Ostia and brought
to Aquileia. It was overwhelming.@0003
@000C@0017But you succeeded
because of your talent...@0003
@0009@0017That's not what I'm getting at.@0003

@000C@0017Your search led you to Zephiel?@0003
@0009
Yes.@0003
I located Zephiel by following the
energy emitted by the demon dragon.@0003
I remember the exact words in the
conversation we had.@0003
"For what reason have you awakened
a demon dragon?" I asked him.@0003
He was a strange one. With a bored
look on his face, he simply asked,@0003
"Who are you?" to which I answered,
"Dragon."@0003
To that, a smile crept onto his
face.@0003
It was then he told me that he wanted
to give the world to the dragons.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003@0016
@0009Frankly, I didn't trust him,@0003
but I accepted him as the new
leader of the demon dragon.@0003
He ordered it to liberate the
world from humans.@0003
He wanted it to rule the
world in their place.@0003
@000C
Zephiel is dead now.
What is the demon dragon doing?@0003
@0009
It is in this sanctuary, waiting for
its chance to liberate the world.@0003
@000C
What?! Even with her
leader gone?!@0003
Have you taken on the
role of leader now?@0003
@0009
There is no need for that.@0003
Zephiel ordered it to proceed
even in the event of his death.@0003
Idunn will continue until control
is wrested from humans.@0003
@000C
She is nothing but a slave!@0003
Her soul was destroyed and now
she's bound to a dead man's order!@0003
@0009
Do you pity her as Hartmut did?@0003
...Foolish human. Your kind
makes no sense.@0003
Allow me to tell you one more
thing.@0003
No matter how you may want it,@0003
dragons and humans will never be
able to live in harmony.@0003
The differences between our two
species are simply too great.@0003
@000C
That's not true!@0003
I know of a village where dragons
and humans live in peace!@0003
I know a greater peace is
possible with effort!@0003
@0009
Humans and dragons living
together?@0003@0002
Stop your lies.@0003
I will not humor such an
obvious falsehood.@0003@0002
Now, step forward. Let us see
whose strength is greater!@0003

Bern surrendered.@0003
[0938]
Roy traversed underground passageway that
the Eight Heroes used to make their way@0003
to the Dragon Sanctuary.@0003
[0939]
However, Brenya, the last remaining
Dragon Lord of Bern, stood before him.@0003
[093A]
Bern as a nation was gone,
but its spirit was@0003
[093B]
not dead yet...@0003
[093C]
Roy had a heavy heart at
having to fight these ghosts...@0003
[093D]
Etruria
[093E]
Etruria was the other powerful kingdom
along with Bern. After debating about@0003
[093F]
about Guinivere's and Roy's position,
the Etrurian Court decided that they@0003
[0940]
had no reason to attack Bern as they
had not suffered a direct offense.@0003
[0941]
Guinivere was to stay under Etrurian
protection at Aquileia,@0003
[0942]
and the Lycia Alliance Army was to be
an independent squad under the Etrurian@0003
[0943]
military. To test his worth, Etruria
sent Roy to the Western Isles, where@0003
[0944]
his mission was to rid the islands of
the bandits terrorizing the people.@0003
[0945]
The Western Isles is an archipelago
under Etrurian protection lying to@0003
[0946]
the west of the mainland. Many
mining corporations have sprouted up@0003
[0947]
trying to monopolize the rich minerals
that lie in the islands' soil. However,@0003
the riches attracted many bandits, and the
people lived in constant fear of them...@0003
[0948]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@014D
@000C@0013@0017Have you found that
resistance bard yet?@0003
@0009@0014We have a good
lead, milord.@0003
@000C@0013Out with it then.
Where is he?@0003
@0009@0014He's apparently in hiding
in the nearby village.@0003
@000C@0014Removing Elffin the Bard will sever the
head guiding the resistance force.@0003
Find him. Burn the village to the
ground if you have to!@0003
@0009@0012Yes, milord.@0003@0011
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0014@0017I apologize for the
wait, Madam Melady.@0003
@0009@0013@0017You seem to have...
a full plate.@0003
@000C@0014@0017Oh, worry not, our obligations
to Bern take priority over all.@0003
If you need anything, please
don't hesitate to ask.@0003
@0009@0013@0017Then let's get to the matter
we discussed earlier...@0003
@000C@0014@0017Ah, the whereabouts
of Princess Guinivere.@0003
@0009@0013@0017Have you found anything,
Lord Zinque?@0003
@000C@0014I regret to say
that I have not.@0003
Have you been to Juteaux?@0003
@0009@0012I have.@0003
@000C@0014@0017Then I suggest you pay
a visit to Father Orlo.@0003
He resides in the castle at
Eburacum to the north.@0003
He knows the region better than any
of us, so he may have some idea.@0003
However, if even he does not know
where Princess Guinivere might be,@0003
then she is most likely not in
the Isles.@0003
@0009@0013@0017Thank you.@0003
I will speak with
Father Orlo then.@0003
Farewell.@0003
@0011
[0949]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017The resistance is supposedly
very active in this area.@0003
@0009Yes, that's what our
sources say.@0003
But I also hear that Etruria's military is
hunting down members of the resistance.@0003
Their numbers have apparently dwindled.@0003
@000C...Etruria does nothing about bandits but
oppresses the resistance?@0003
Something is very wrong with
this picture...@0003
@0009Indeed it is.@0003
@000CCan we do anything to
help the resistance?@0003
@0009Our hands are tied...@0003
To do so would directly oppose
Etruria's nobility.@0003
We are here under Etruria's
orders, remember.@0003
@000CI'll send a letter to General Cecilia
and see what she has to say.@0003
Let's not do anything too
rash just yet.@0003@0009@0011
@0008@0010@0152@0014Lord Roy!@0003
Etrurian troops are attacking the village
to find a member of the resistance force!@0003
They're under orders from Lord Zinque,
the noble who controls this area.@0003@0011
@0009@0010@0154@0013Oh no!@0003
...But should we intervene?@0003
@000C@0014We haven't the time to
await General Cecilia's reply...@0003
But I want to help the people.@0003
...Even if it means opposing
an Etrurian noble.@0003
@0009Lord Roy...@0003
@000CWe fight!@0003
Our purpose is just!
Make Lycia proud!@0003
[094A]
@0009@0010@0136@000C@0010@012E
@0009@0017Were you able to ascertain
Princess Guinivere's whereabouts?@0003
@000CUnfortunately, no.@0003
But a bishop named Orlo in charge of
the mines in the north may know.@0003
@0009@0013Very well.
Then we head north.@0003
@000C@0014Galle...
I'm sorry.@0003
King Zephiel wanted to keep the matter
of Princess Guinivere a secret,@0003
so only I was assigned to search
for her.@0003
I'm sorry to get you mixed
up in this...@0003
@0009Don't worry yourself.@0003
@000CBut you work directly under General
Murdock. Surely you have other duties.@0003
@0009General Murdock agreed to allow
me to assist you.@0003
He thinks it's vital we find the
princess and the Fire Emblem.@0003
@000C...Do you think Princess
Guinivere has the Fire Emblem?@0003
@0009That's what His Majesty
the king thinks.@0003
And I think he's correct,
all things considered.@0003
@000C@0016@0012......@0003
@0009@0016@0014Come now,
don't be like that...@0003
I'm sure Princess Guinivere
went with good intentions.@0003
Let's hurry now.@0003
@000C@0012You're right...@0003
[094B]
@000C@0010@012B@000C@0012@0017...Where...am I...?@0003
@0009@0010@015A@0013@0017Are you awake?@0003
@000C@0012@0017...What...happened...?@0003
@0009@0014@0017We found you lying at the entrance to
the village, covered in wounds.@0003
We took you home and have been
taking care of you.@0003
@000C@0012@0017Thank you...
But you are...?@0003
@0009@0013@0017My name is Mary.
I live in this village.@0003
@000C@0014@0017...You live here...@0006 Oh no!@0003
My very presence endangers
this village...@0003
...It may even be
too late...@0003
@0009@0012I'm sorry?@0003
@000C@0014I am Elffin...
One of the resistance force.@0003
The lord here is sure to send
troops in to capture me.@0003
@0009The resistance force...@0003
@000CLady Mary,
you should leave here.@0003
The village is in danger.@0003
@0009@0013@0017...No,
I will stay.@0003
@000C@0012@0017...Why?@0003
@0009@0014@0017I have a younger brother, but he left
with his friend next door to find work.@0003
I'm taking care of his friend's
sister. I can't abandon her.@0003
@000C@0013@0017I understand...@0003
The most I can do to protect
this village is leave.@0003
I thank you again for
tending to my wounds.@0003
Please take care.@0003
@0009@0013@0017Yes, you too.@0003
[094C]
@000C@0010@014D@0009@0010@01D7
@000C@0017What is going on out there?@0003
Why is it taking so long to find a
single member of the resistance?!@0003
@0009It's the Lycian Army!@0003
They've joined the battle on
behalf of the villagers...@0003
@000CThe Lycian Army?
They would betray Etruria?!@0003
@0009Also, milord, we have received
a missive from Juteaux.@0003
The Lycian Army is suspected
of working with the bandits.@0003
Lord Arcardo has given us orders
to take them dead or alive.@0003
@000C@0017The Lycian Army has ties with bandits?
Hah! The irony!@0003
That fool only wants to save face...@0003
@0009@0017Excuse me, milord?@0003
@000CThis is not the mainland.
The Isles are ruled by might.@0003
@0009I'm not quite sure
I understand...@0003
@000CPay it no mind.@0003
Was that all the message
from Juteaux said?@0003
@0009There's more.@0003
Lord Arcardo has provided
us with reinforcements.@0003
@000CWhat?!@0003
@0009They should arrive soon.@0003
@000CConfound it!@0003
We won't get credit for defeating Lycia
if we're aided by reinforcements!@0003
We must wrap this up before they
can join the fight...@0003
Ah, I've an idea!
Get me Scollan!@0003
@0009Yes, milord.@0003@0011@0006
@000A@0010@0151You called,
Lord Zinque?@0003
@000C@0014Burn down the village.
Kill any who resist.@0003
@000A...Can we take
the loot?@0003
@000C@0013Do as you wish.
Just do it quickly.@0003
@000A@0017You can count on us, Lord Zinque.
Heh heh heh...@0003
[094D]
@000C@0010@0151@0013@0017Gonzalez!
Where are you, Gonzalez?!@0003
@0009@0010@012FHere...
I here...@0003
@000CThere's a village to the south.
With me so far?@0003
@0009@0012With you so far.@0003
@000C@0014Good. It might be a base
for the resistance.@0003
Zinque says to burn it to the
ground, village and all.@0003
@0009@0012Village and all...@0003
@000C@0014Good, you understand.
Now get goin'!@0003
Don't screw this one up,
you dimwit.@0003
@0009@0013I...I...@0003
@000CYou got a problem? Does your head
hurt from thinking too much?@0003
@0009N-no...@0003@0011@0006
@000C@0014Heh, he's ugly as sin,
but he's got a heart of gold.@0003
There's nothin' wrong with
tearin' down a few houses.@0003@0002
Are we clear, wretches?
No questions?@0003
@0009@0010@0150@0012We got it, Boss!@0003
[094E]
@000C@0010@010D@0017That's the
Lycian Army...@0003
@0009@0010@0128They were assigned to fight
against the bandits...@0003
@000CI know.@0003
But Lord Arcardo says they're
allied with the bandits now.@0003
Why they're doing exactly the opposite
of their assignment is beyond me...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000CThea, take your soldiers and
attack from the north.@0003
I'll commence the attack
from here.@0003
@0009Yes, sir.@0003@0011
@000CThea!
Hold on.@0003
@0009@0010@0128Yes, sir?@0003
@000C@0017I hear that you have
siblings.@0003
@0009Yes, sir, I have two sisters.
One older, one younger.@0003
@000CAre they pegasus
knights like you?@0003
@0009They are, actually.
Why do you ask?@0003
@000CI have a younger
sister myself...@0003
@0009Any sister of yours
must be enchanting.@0003
@000C@0017Yes, she is a sight.@0003
I heard, however, she got tangled up
in some mess and now she's missing...@0003
@0009What?
Oh my...@0003
@000CI have some people looking into it,
but they've yet to find anything.@0003
If I didn't have this mission,
I would search for her myself...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000CThea, be careful out there.
For your family's sake.@0003
@0009Yes, sir.
Thank you.@0003
[094F]
@000C@0010@010D@0009@0010@01D7
@000C@0017Ready then? Let's move.@0003
@0009Sir, are you sure?@0003
@000COf what?@0003
@0009Lord Arcardo said Ilia's pegasus
knights are expendable.@0003
They should be fighting on the
front line, not us.@0003
Surely the lives of us Etrurian
soldiers are more valuable.@0003
@000CDon't be ridiculous.
They are reliable companions.@0003
We will attack at the same time...
or before them, if need be.@0003
Understood?@0003
@0009Yes, sir.@0003@0011
@000C...Lord Arcardo's story
is curious, though...@0003
The army from Lycia only
arrived very recently.@0003
How could they create ties with
the bandits so quickly...?@0003
[0950]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0153
@0009@0017Are you ready?
We move southward!@0003
@000CCaptain...
Are you sure we'll be all right?@0003
@0009Is something wrong?@0003
@000CThe Etrurian army considers us disposable.
They may send us to our doom...@0003
@0009Where did you hear that?@0003
@000COne of the other riders was told so
by someone in the Etrurian army.@0003
@0009Pay no mind to
mere rumors.@0003
@000CBut...@0003
@0009I'm certain Commander Klein
would never approve of that.@0003
@000CDo you really think so?@0003
@0009Commander Klein's not like that.
I trust him with my life.@0003
@000C...Very well.@0003
Then we'll trust him as well,
for we trust you, Captain.@0003
@0009Good.
Let's go!@0003
[0951]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@014D@0009@0017Lord Zinque, reinforcements from
Juteaux should arrive shortly.@0003
@000CBlast!@0003
We have enough problems
as it is...@0003
The last thing I need is
reinforcements stealing the credit!@0003
[0952]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@014D@0009@0017Additional reinforcements
will be arriving shortly!@0003
@000CI only hope they
will suffice...@0003
[0953]
@0009@0010@012F@000C@0010@0122
@000C@0012@0017Excuse me!@0003
@0009@0013W-what you doing?!
I am enemy!@0003
@000C@0014I know...@0003
But there's such a look of
sorrow in your eyes.@0003
@0009...There is village near
mountain. You know?@0003
@000C@0013Yes, I know it.@0003
@0009Tell people escape.
I have order. Destroy village.@0003
I...@0003
@000C@0014What? Don't!@0003
The villagers
are innocent...@0003
@0009@0013No.
It order. I must.@0003
@000C@0014It sounds to me like you should leave
the person who gave you that order.@0003
@0009Leave?@0003
@000C@0014@0017Yes!
You can fight with us.@0003
We're protecting the villagers.@0003
@0009@0017...No...
I monster...@0003
People mean to me...
People throw stones...@0003
People say, "Go away!"...
"You a monster!"...@0003
Not human...@0003
@000CThat's horrible!
Of course you're human!@0003
You're a very kind-hearted man.
I can tell.@0003
Please, come with us.
Don't be afraid.@0003
@0009@0013@0017Me afraid? I never afraid! Everyone
afraid of ME! I not afraid!@0003
@000CNo. You ARE afraid.@0003
You're afraid that people will throw
stones and call you a monster.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000CBut you don't have to
be afraid of us.@0003
Everyone in our army is nice. They
won't do that to you.@0003
Be brave... Take that first step, and
you'll never have to be afraid again.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
[0954]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0129@0013@0017Th-Thea!
Sister!@0003
@0009Shanna...?@0003
@000C@0014What are you doing here?@0003
@0009...I have a contract with
Commander Klein of Etruria.@0003
Shanna...
Are you with the Lycian Army?@0003
@000C@0012Yes.@0003
@0009@0013I see...
Then this was inevitable.@0003
Draw your lance!@0003
@000C@0080@000F@0014No...
I don't want to fight you!@0003
@0009...Shanna, you know the code
of the Ilian mercenaries.@0003
@000D...Never betray your employer...@0003
@0009Precisely.@0003
And we must follow that code, even if
it means we must fight our own kin.@0003
@000D@0080@000EBut...one of us
could be killed!@0003
@0009@0080@000CI know that!
But we must fight!@0003
Failing to do so would damage the
reputation of the Ilian mercenaries.@0003
Our nation can't afford to lose
its mercenary contracts!@0003
@000C@0013Thea...@0003
@000A@0014Now, draw
your lance, Shanna!@0003@000C@0011@0002@0007
@000A...Why...@0003
Why does it have to be
like this...?@0003
[0955]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0129
@000C@0012Thea!@0003
@0009@0013@0017Shanna...
Are you prepared to fight?@0003
@000C@0014@0017No!
We don't have to fight!@0003
@0009@0013@0017Of course we do.
Must I repeat myself--@0003
@000C@0014@0017Commander Klein said he
would join us!@0003
We don't have to fight!@0003
@0009@0012@0017What?
Really...?@0003
You're...telling
the truth?@0003
@000C@0014@0017Yes!@0003
To fight me would be
breaking the code!@0003
@0009@0016@0012......@0003
@000C@0016@0013@0017...Thea?@0003
@0009@0017...I'm so relieved...@0003
@000C@0017Thea...@0003
@0009@0017Thank goodness...
I was so scared...@0003
@000CWe'll always be together,
Sister...@0003
[0956]
@0009@0010@0128@000C@0010@0129@000C@0012@0017Th-Thea!
Sister!@0003
@0009@0013Shanna...?@0003
@000CWhat are you doing here?@0003
@0009...I have a contract with
Commander Klein of Etruria.@0003
Shanna...
Are you with the Lycian Army?@0003
@000C@0012Yes.@0003
@0009@0013I see...
Then this was inevitable.@0003
Draw your lance!@0003
@000C@0014No, Commander Klein said
@0017he would join us!@0003
@000C@0014We don't have to fight!@0003
@0009@0012@0017What? Really?@0003
@000C@0014@0017Yes!@0003
@0009...That's a relief.
Then I will join you as well.@0003
@000CThanks, Sister!@0003
[0957]
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@010D
@0009@0017Wait!@0003
Aren't you an Etrurian commander?
Why are you attacking us?!@0003
@000CI have specific orders from
Lord Arcardo to take you down.@0003
@0009Can't you see what's happening here?@0003
The people are suffering from
the lords' abusive treatment!@0003
And you're helping them.
You should be ashamed!@0003
@000C...Wait.@0003
Are you saying that you're
helping the villagers?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
The lord here is ransacking the
village in search of the resistance.@0003
We're fighting to stop him.@0003
And you're apparently
on his side.@0003
@000CI had no such intention.@0003
My orders stated that you were the
ones working with the bandits.@0003
@0009What?!@0003
Why would we be working
with bandits?@0003
We just want to clean things up
here and get home to Lycia!@0003
@000C...Such nerve.@0003
@0009What?!@0003
@000CLord Arcardo has made a fool of me.@0003
I have been so blind not to see
through his thin veil of deceit.@0003
@0009@0017...Do you see what
we see now?@0003
@000CI am Klein of House Reglay
of Etruria.@0003
Forgive me for my misguided
attack against you.@0003
@0009I am General Roy of
the Lycian Army.@0003
@000CGeneral Roy, I would advise you
to be cautious.@0003
You are against Lord Arcardo.@0003
He will have every pawn at his disposal
after your head.@0003
@0009Thank you for
the advice...@0003
@000CIf you would allow it,
I will join you.@0003
@0009You will?@0003
@000CYes. I wish to monitor you
as an Etrurian commander.@0003
I should prove useful as
both a fighter and a diplomat.@0003
@0009Thank you.@0003
[0958]
@0009@0010@0103@000C@0010@010D
@0009Klein!@0003
@000CClarine?
You are safe!@0003
@0009I'm sorry I left
like I did.@0003
But I wanted so badly
to see you!@0003
@000C@0017Oh, the trouble
you get into...@0003
Well, you're safe, and that's
what matters.@0003
@0017...What brings you out here?@0003
Did you find a trustworthy
mercenary for hire?@0003
@0009@0017No, I joined the Lycian Army.@0003
@000C@0017The Lycian Army?!@0003
@0009@0017Yes!@0003
My healing staves
have been most useful!@0003
@000C...I see.@0003
I thought your eyes looked...
sharper.@0003
@0009I'm a lady now, I am.@0003
@000C@0017...Let me ask you this.@0003
What kind of individual
is General Roy?@0003
@0009@0017Hmm... He's a tad rough around
the edges for a noble...@0003
His hair especially is an
absolute mess...@0003
@000C...Let me rephrase that.@0003
@0017Is General Roy working
with the bandits?@0003
@0009@0080@000BNo, of course not! We've been
sent here to vanquish the bandits!@0003
@000CSo I heard...@0003
@0009The Etrurians here are
malicious people...@0003
It is so embarrassing.@0003
Klein...
Are you working for them?@0003
@000CNo. Not anymore.@0003
@0009What?@0003
@000CI was sent here to protect
the villagers.@0003
I hereby join the Lycian Army to
fulfill my mission.@0003
@0009@0017Thank you, Klein!@0003
@000CShall we, then?
Will you introduce me to General Roy?@0003
@0009@0080@000CNaturally!
I love you, Klein.@0003
[0959]
@0009@0010@010D@000C@0010@0128
@0009Thea!@0003
@000C@0017Commander Klein!
What is the matter?@0003
@0009There's been a change of plans.@0003
We are going to fight under
General Roy of the Lycian Army.@0003
@000CUnderstood, sir. We shall
follow you without question.@0003
@0009I don't mind a question here
or there, to be frank.@0003
@000CWe are Ilian
mercenaries, sir.@0003
We follow our employer's
every order.@0003
And besides...@0003
@0009Yes?@0003
@000C@0017I trust you to make
proper judgments.@0003
@0009Thank you, Thea.@0003
[095A]
@0009@0010@0103@000C@0010@010D
@0009Klein!@0003
@000CClarine?@0003
You are safe!@0003
@0009I'm sorry I left
like I did.@0003
But I wanted so badly
to see you!.@0003
@000C@0017Oh, the trouble you get into...@0003
Well, you're safe, and that's
what matters.@0003
@0017...What brings you out here?@0003
Did you find a trustworthy
mercenary for hire?@0003
@0009@0017No, I joined the Lycian Army.@0003
@000C@0017The Lycian Army?!@0003
@0009@0017Yes!@0003
@000C@0017Well...I'm sure you've been
through much with them.@0003
@0009@0017I'm a lady now,
I am.@0003
[095B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018A
@0017...The resistance suffered a
crippling defeat here.@0003
Here, take this. I'm going to
look for other survivors.@0003
There is still hope if we
can find our leader.@0003
[095C]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0189
@0017I hate the resistance!@0003
We civilians have to deal with the
consequences of their actions.@0003
You know we stand no chance if
we try to stand up to our lord.@0003
We just want to lead a normal life.@0003@0002
@000COh...I'm sorry.
I'm just frustrated.@0003
I have no useful skills so I can't
help you...but take this...@0003
[095D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0184
@0017I wonder how Mary's doing...@0003
Her brother and his friend are both
traveling, trying to make money.@0003
It's too dangerous to go outside now...
Can you go check on her?@0003
Here, I'll give you this for
your trouble...@0003
[095E]
@0009@0010@011E@000C@0010@015A
@000C@0012Ward!@0003
@0009@0013Sis!
It's good to see you.@0003
@000CYou've returned?@0003
@0009@0017Well, not exactly...
We're here on a mission...@0003
@000C...You're never coming
back, are you?@0003
@0009@0014No! Of course I will!
...Just not yet.@0003
Just you wait. When I come back I'll
have more money than I can carry.@0003
Then all our problems will be a
thing of the past.@0003
@000C@0017I don't care about that...
I just want you safe.@0003
@0009@0013@0017Sis...@0003
@000C@0014@0017I know how brash and hotheaded you
can be, but always remember...@0003
There are people who care
about you.@0003
@0009@0016@0012......@0003
@000C@0016@0013Here, take this.@0003
@0009@0012@0017What is it?@0003
@000C@0014@0017It's a special weapon.@0003
I nursed a traveler back to health,
and he left it in return.@0003
You can use it, can't you?@0003
@0009Thanks, Sis!
I've gotta go now.@0003
@000C@0013Just be careful...@0003
[095F]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@015A
@0009@0012@0017Mary...@0003
@000C@0013@0017Lot!
You've returned?@0003
@0009@0014@0017No...
We just happened to be nearby.@0003
@000C@0013Oh... Mieu won't
be happy about that.@0003
@0009@0014I've made you take care of Mieu
ever since our mother died.@0003
I'm sorry to force
that burden on you.@0003
@000C@0013It's not your fault...@0003
@0009@0012Someday...I swear...
I swear I'll return.@0003
...Can I leave Mieu to
you until then?@0003
@000C...You swear it?@0003
@0009...Yes.@0003
@000C@0014Don't lie like that... This is war.
You don't know if you'll come back.@0003
@0009@0016@0012......@0003
@000C@0016@0013@0017But I'll be waiting...
Until eternity.@0003
@0009@0012@0017I'm sorry.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Oh, you should
take this.@0003
@0009@0012@0017What is it?@0003
@000C@0014@0017It's a special weapon.@0003
It will help you
keep your promise.@0003
@0009@0013I appreciate it.
Now...I must be off again.@0003
@000C@0017Be careful...@0003
[0960]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015A@0017Have you seen my brother?@0003
His name is Ward,
and he's a mercenary...@0003
Have you at least
heard of him?@0003
Well, take this for
your trouble.@0003
[0961]
@0009@0010@011E@000C@0010@015B
@000C@0013It's Ward!@0003
@0009@0014@0017Hey, Mieu!@0003
...Come on, can't you call me
UNCLE Ward?@0003
@000C@0017But...you're just Ward.@0003
@0009@0013Ah, never mind.@0003
You look like you've
gotten bigger.@0003
@000CYeah!@0003
@0009@0017...It's dangerous here.
Go hide in the hills.@0003
@000C...Alone?@0003
@0009My sister's still here, right?
She'll take you.@0003
@000C@0014@0017Yeah, Auntie Mary's here.@0003
@0009@0017So she's Auntie Mary but
I'm just Ward, huh?@0003
@000C@0012@0017Oh.
Here you go.@0003
@0009@0013@0017What's this?
A wing?@0003
@000C@0014@0017It'll make you
like a bird!@0003
@0009@0013@0017Like a bird?
What's that mean?@0003
@000C@0017Like a bird. You know.@0003
@0009@0014No, I don't know.@0017@0003
But, uh, anyway,
this is for me?@0003
@000C@0017No, it's for
Big Brother Lot.@0003
@0009@0013@0017And Lot is Big Brother Lot...
Have you got it out for me?@0003
@000C@0014@0017Ha ha ha! I'll go see Mary.
Here's the wing.@0003
Give it to Lot, OK,
Uncle Ward?@0003@0011
@0009And NOW she calls
me Uncle...@0003@0002
@0017Whoa, are you OK?!
Don't trip...@0003
[0962]
@0009@0010@011F@000C@0010@015B
@000CBrother! You're home!@0003
@0009@0013Mieu!
Have you been a good girl?@0003
@000CYes, I was good!
I didn't even wet my bed!@0003
@0009That's my girl.@0003
@000C@0014@0017Lot...
While you were away, Mother...@0003
@0009Yeah, I know...
She went to sleep...@0003
@000CHere...
Mother left this for you.@0003
She said you might
find a use for it.@0003
@0009@0012@0016......@0003@0016
@000C@0014Brother...@0003
You won't leave me,
will you?@0003
You won't go to sleep
like Mother...?@0003
@0009@0017Of course not!@0003
In fact, next time you see me I'll
have a whole wagon of presents.@0003
Just listen to Mary and
stay good, all right?@0003
@000C@0012OK!@0003
@0009@0014@0017Go hide in the hills with Mary.
It's dangerous here.@0003
@000C@0013I will...
@0017And Lot?@0003
@0009@0012Yeah?@0003
@000C@0013You promised!@0003
Don't leave me!@0003
@0009I won't...@0003@0002@000C@0011@0005
@0009At least, I hope
I won't...@0003
[0963]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015BLot?@0003
@0017...Oh.
I'm sorry...@0003
Take this.@0003
[0964]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0182Ah, our heroes!@0003
I thank you on behalf
of the village.@0003
This is made from the
scale of a dragon.@0003
It's said it will protect the
one who uses it from harm.@0003
Please, take it.@0003
[0965]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0186A few months ago, my
granddaughter went missing.@0003
We all searched in the
mountains and found her.@0003
She was with a hulking monster of a man, so
we threw stones at him to drive him off...@0003
Afterwards my granddaughter told me that
he was the one who led her to the village.@0003
...If you ever find that man,
would you give him this?@0003
It's a special axe that's effective
against swords.@0003
And...@0006tell him I'm sorry.@0003
[0966]
@0010@014DThe people are suffering...?@0005
What concern is that to me?@0003
They live to serve me.
Their wails are meaningless.@0003
[0967]
@0010@014D
@0017This is my land...
Mine alone...@0003@0002
None...shall...@0003
[0968]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Lord Roy, there is a young man claiming
to be with the resistance here.@0003
@000C@0017I'll see him.
Let him pass.@0003@0009@0011
@0008@0010@012BI am pleased to meet you.
My name is Elffin.@0003
I am a member of the
resistance force.@0003
@000CI am Roy of the
Lycian Army.@0003
@0008You have my thanks for
saving the village here.@0003
@000CWe simply did what
we believe is right.@0003
@0008@0017But now you stand
against Etruria.@0003
@000CEven so, I have
no regrets.@0003
We may have opposed Etruria's
immediate interests,@0003
but once the truth about the Isles is
out, I'm certain they will understand.@0003
I sent a letter to a trustworthy
Etrurian noble.@0003
If she takes appropriate measures,
they will send us aid.@0003
@0008I would not
be so sure...@0003
@000CWhy is that?@0003
@0008Don't you find it odd that Etruria
requested your help here at all?@0003
@000CActually...yes, I do.@0003
@0008If I may be so bold as to guess...@0003
Was it High Chancellor Roartz and
Lord Arcardo who requested your help?@0003
@000C...It was.@0003
@0008There may have been ulterior motives for
sending your army away.@0003
Perhaps your presence in Lycia was
undesirable to them.@0003
@000CI never even
considered that...@0003
@0008There are rumors...that Roartz and
Arcardo are working with Bern.@0003
[0969]
@0009@0010@015A@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0014Are you the leader
of this army?@0003
@000C@0013@0017Yes, I am.@0003
@0009@0014@0017I wish to thank you for
protecting our village.@0003
@000CThere is no thanks necessary...
We did what we believe is right.@0003
@0009Regardless, I want you to have this
as a token of our gratitude.@0003
[096A]
@0009@0010@01DC@000C@0010@010D
@0009Commander Klein, we will stay and help
with reconstruction as directed.@0003
@000CGood. These people
need you.@0003
@0009Would that we could
fight at your side.@0003
Here is the bolt we
were holding for you.@0003
You may need it more
than we do.@0003
Farewell and good luck,
Commander Klein.@0003
@000CThank you.
Good luck to you as well.@0003
[096B]
@000C@0010@0128@0009@0010@0153
Captain!@0003
We will return to Ilia
to make our report.@0003
@000CVery good.
Thank you for your service.@0003
@0009Oh, and take this...@0003
Your sister gave it to me
before we left.@0003
Please be careful...@0003
@000CThank you.
You too.@0003
[096C]
@000C@0010@0187@0017Hurry!
This way!@0003
@0009@0010@0189A-are you sure about this?
If we get caught we're--@0003
@000CDon't be stupid!@0003
If we stay, we'll be
worked to death!@0003
You're just going to lie
down and take that?@0003
Don't you have a family
or something back home?@0003
@0009Yeah...@0003
@000CThere are people coming to
help us from the northeast.@0003
We just have to make it
there in one piece!@0003
[096D]
@000C@0010@0146@0017More people escaped?!@0003
@0080@000EWhere were the guards?!@0003
@0008@0010@014FThey were unconscious.
Someone drugged their food...@0003
@000C...Then there must be a
traitor among us.@0003@0008@0011
@000CMorgan!@000A@0010@01DD@0003
@000CPursue and eliminate
the escaped workers.@0003
@000AYes, Lord Arcardo.@0003@001C
@000CI will return to Juteaux.
Don't let them escape.@0003
Send more hands to the mines as well.
I can't afford to lose more workers!@0003
[096E]
@000C@0080@000D@0017What?!
Then Lycia is in danger!@0003
@000D@0010@0154L-Lord Roy!@0003
@0008Your country may be in peril.@0003
Are you free to waste your time
on the Isles as you are?@0003@000DHe's right!@0003
Bern wanted us out of Lycia so
they could launch an invasion!@0003
We must head back at once!@0003
@000B...We stay here.@0003@001C
@000DWhat?!
Why?!@0003@001C
@0008@0016......@0016@0003
@000BIt's difficult to judge what may
be hearsay and what may be truth.@0003
We can't simply jump on this
rumor and run back to Lycia.@0003
I am certainly concerned, but my father
and General Cecilia are there.@0003
The people on the Isles have only
us to rely on.@0003
@001C
@000DThat may be, but...@0003@001C
@000BIf we leave without finishing our mission,
then all we've done here was for naught.@0003
@0008...Your army is blessed with
a levelheaded leader.@0003
@000BWhat?@0003
@0008Lord Roy, I am sorry for
testing you so.@0003
@000DTesting us?
So that was a lie?!@0003
@0008It was the truth.@0003
However, I presented the rumor in a
way that you might take rash action.@0003
Your leader is a prudent individual.
I would join you if you allow it.@0003
@000B...I don't like that
you tested us.@0003
@0017But if you can help,
I welcome you.@0003
@0017Now, back to the concern we face here.@0003
What can we do to help the
people of the Isles?@0003
@0008You should head south...
towards Caldonia.@0003
@000BWhy?@0003
@0008Castle Eidyna is located there.@0003
It is where workers are kept before
they are sent to Eburacum.@0003
@000BThen we must save
the people there!@0003@0006
@0008Lord Roy,
please take this sword.@0003
@000BWhat is this?@0003
@0008It is called a wyrmslayer.@0003
It was created during the
Scouring to use against dragons.@0003
It is effective against
wyverns as well.@0003
@000BWyrmslayer?
Is this a legendary weapon?@0003
@0008No. Legendary weapons can only be used by
those whose skill rivals the Eight Legends.@0003
This weapon, however, can be wielded by
anyone with experience in swordplay.@0003
[096F]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Elffin, is that castle to
the southwest our target?@0003
@0009Yes, that is Castle Eidyna.@0003
The people kidnapped on the Isles
are first sent there.@0003
They are then taken to Eburacum
and forced to work in the mines.@0003
As it happens, today is the weekly
shipment of captives to the mines.@0003
It will be difficult to rescue
them once they've been sent off.@0003
@000CThen you're saying we have
to rescue them now!@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
I already had some spies infiltrate the
castle and help the people escape.@0003
@000CWhat will the captives
do once they're out?@0003
@0009I told them to send the
captives to the northeast.@0003
In other words, our
present location.@0003
@000CThen we must rescue those people
before sieging the castle.@0003
[0970]
@0009@0010@0189@000C@0010@0120
@000C@0017They're imprisoned in
that castle, you say?@0003
@0009That's right.@0003
@000CThen we've no time to lose. Let's begin
this daring prison break, shall we?@0003
@0009...I'm sorry to ask for
your help like this.@0003
I know you're looking
for your daughter...@0003
@000C@0017Don't be absurd! Consider it
payment for your hospitality.@0003
I won't let some blood-sucking
lord take advantage of his people!@0003@0002
I'm Bartre the Brave, and I'll
smash these puny insects!@0003
[0971]
@0009@0010@01DD@000C@0010@01D7
@000CSir Morgan,
the reinforcements are ready!@0003
@0009Good.
Deploy them immediately.@0003
Spread them around the castle
to defend us on all sides.@0003
[0972]

[0973]
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@0113
@000C@0013@0017Father?
What are you doing here?@0003
@0009@0017Fir!
I've been looking for you.@0003
@000C@0014@0017Father,
I've already made up my mind.@0003
I want to become a great master
of the sword like Mother...@0003
@0009@0017That is good.
I don't intend to drag you home.@0003
In fact, I want to help you
in your journey.@0003
@000C@0013@0017Help me?@0003
@0009@0014I know well the hardships one faces
in a journey of self-improvement.@0003
I can help you out of a bind if
things get rough.@0003
@000CBut Father, if you keep helping me,
my training is meaningless.@0003
@0009@0012Nonsense.@0003
@0014With your old man around, we can
practice sparring any time!@0003
Do you refuse your
father's love?!@0003
@000C@0013No! It's nothing
like that, but...@0003
@0009@0017It's settled then.@0003
But first we capture
the castle.@0003
@0011@000C@0012@0017Sigh...@0003
@0014I guess I should tell Roy that
we have another member...@0003
[0974]

[0975]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@018B
Are you the guys
helping us out?@0003
Then please, take this.@0003
I grabbed it as I escaped
from the castle.@0003
I hope everyone else
made it out...@0003
[0976]
@0010@01DD
@0017What are you doing?!@0003
Hurry and kill the ones
who escaped!@0003@0002
Wait, you're not one of
my men... Wh-who are you?!@0003
[0977]
@0010@01DD
@0017The resistance force has
been eliminated in this area...@0003@0002
Who...are you people...?@0003
[0978]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Elffin!
Are you all right?@0003
@0009@0017This wound is great...
But still, I must not...!@0003
@000C@0017You should stay off the battlefield.
Leave the fighting to us.@0003
@0009Yes, you are right...
Forgive my being a hindrance...@0003
[0979]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Even though we've saved the
people at Castle Eidyna,@0003
there are others still
suffering in the mines.@0003
@0009That is correct.@0003
To liberate the Western Isles,
we must take the capital.@0003
@000CThen our next destination
is Juteaux.@0003
...Elffin, may I ask
you something?@0003
@0009Of course, Lord Roy.@0003
@000CPardon me if I am
mistaken,@0003
but are you of high
Etrurian nobility?@0003
@0009What?!!@0003@0002
...What makes you think that?@0003
@000CI can't quite explain
it, but...@0003
The way you talk sounds
very educated.@0003
In Ostia, I learned how to study
others and size them up.@0003
Am I right?@0003
@0009What would you do
if you are?@0003
@000COh. Nothing
in particular.@0003
I'm sure you have a good reason
to hide your identity.@0003
You can tell me when you
feel the time is right.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000CLet's head for Juteaux!@0003
To save the Isles and defeat
the true enemy of the people!@0003
[097A]

[097B]
@0008@0010@0189@000A@0010@0187@000C@0010@0154
@000AHey, you with the mustache!@0003
@000CWhat?!
Who are you?@0003
@000AHere, give this
to General Roy.@0003
Thanks to him, we can see
our families again.@0003
@0008We of the Western Isles always
pay our debts of gratitude!@0003@001C
@000ATell him thanks.@0003@001C
@0008We're all grateful from the
bottom of our hearts!@0003
[097C]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0148
@000C@0017
...Then Narcian fell at Aquileia.@0003
@0009Yes, milady.
We've received confirmation.@0003
@000CI see...@0003@0009@0011
@0008@0010@0146@000A@0010@013DLady Brunnya...
What will you have us do?@0003
@000CYou have our protection,
Lord Roartz.@0003
You have helped us so much already.
We shall not neglect you.@0003
@001C@0008@0017I thank you...@0003@001C
@000C@0017
Lord Arcardo, I assign you to
defend this land of Talas.@0003
Lord Roartz, your post will be
the city of Bulgar.@0003
@0008Talas?! Here?!@0003
But this is so close to Aquileia.
The enemy draws near!@0003
@000C@0017
Then stop them in their tracks.@0003
This region's proximity to Aquileia
makes it strategically invaluable.@0003
It would be an ideal base of operations
if the enemy can be repelled.@0003
@0008@0017That much is true...@0003
@000ABulgar...lies deep within Sacae.@0003
I hear there is great unrest
among the nomads...@0003
@000C@0017Force them into submission.
That is your specialty, is it not?@0003
@000A@0017I suppose, but...@0003
@000C@0017Rumor says that Roy, commander of
the attacking army, is but a boy.@0003
Even so, he has led his army to victory
through countless skirmishes and traps.@0003
Under his guidance, the Lycian Army
has been rebuilt stronger than ever.@0003
He has gone through greater hardships
than you, yet you complain?@0003
Do you intend to lose to a child?@0003@001C
@0008@0017@0016......@0003@0016@001C
@000CI must be off.
I pray for your success.@0003@0011
@0009@0016......@0003
[097D]
@0008@0010@01D7@000C@0010@0148
@0008@0017...Are you certain we should leave them?
They will surely fall.@0003
@000C
They are disgraceful cowards who cast
away their homeland to save their necks.@0003
We owe them nothing. They should be grateful
to receive the few troops they have.@0003
@0008@0016......@0003
[097E]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0013@0017We will soon approach
the Etrurian border.@0003
@000C@0014Thank you for everything,
Father Yoder.@0003
We've only made it this far thanks
to the assistance of the church.@0003
@0009I am only repaying your favor.@0003
Had you not captured Aquileia, we would
suffer great persecution from Bern.@0003
This is nothing compared to what you
did for us.@0003
@000C@0013@0017It was my pleasure to
help the church.@0003
@0009@0014@0017If I may be so bold...
Can I ask one more favor?@0003
@000COf course,
if I am capable.@0003
@0009If you discover anything
else about the dragons...@0003
@000CSay no more.@0003
If I find anything new, I will
report to you immediately.@0003
@0009@0017You have my eternal thanks.@0003@0017
...Oh yes, one word of
caution before you go.@0003
The lands around here...@0003
They are surrounded by
high mountains and hills.@0003
It is also difficult to see
in the dark of the night...@0003
@000CThese are ideal conditions
for an ambush...@0003
@0009Exactly.@0003
Castle Talas up ahead
is under Bern's control.@0003
@000CI'll bear that in mind.
Thank you for the advice.@0003
@0009@0014@0017Not at all.@0003
May the Etrurian Army go with
Saint Elimine's blessing.@0003
[097F]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0168
Ah, are you fighting against Bern?
Then please take this staff.@0003
It was once used by the noble
Lady Tina...@0003
[0980]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017A
We don't get many visitors
up here...@0003@0002
What?@0003
The enemy is planning to
attack our village?@0003
I'll make sure everyone
knows...@0003
I must thank you for
telling us.@0003
Please take this.@0003
[0981]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017D
I hear there's a village
far to the northeast.@0003
I've never met anyone
who's been that far.@0003
I wonder if anyone still
lives there.@0003
[0982]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0177
I saw some shady-looking
people in Bern's ranks.@0003
Probably thieves.@0003
You should tell the villagers
before they get ransacked.@0003
[0983]
@0010@0146@0017
W-why?!@0003
What have I done to
deserve such a fate?!@0003
[0984]
@0010@0146@0017
I...am a noble...
of Etruria...!@0003@0002
I cannot...die...in a place
such as this...@0005 Gah!@0003
[0985]
@000D@0010@0154@000B@0010@0102
@000D@001C@0017Lord Arcardo...@0003
What a pathetic ending for
one of his stature.@0003
@000B@001C
A year ago I myself never imagined
I would be leading an army.@0003
Fate can be unpredictable...@0003
Perhaps we'll even be able to
turn the tides against Bern.@0003
@000D@0011@0009@0010@0154@0016...?@0003@0016
Lord Roy, what is that
in your hand?@0003
@000BOh, this?
It's the Fire Emblem.@0003
@0009That tiny gemstone...?@0003
@000B
Princess Guinivere wanted me
to keep it.@0003
It seemed...difficult for her
to give it to me...@0003
I think she still hoped to end
the war with diplomacy...@0003
@0009
Hm... Perhaps she had faith in her brother,
even if that seems unlikely.@0003
@000B@0012Why do you say that?@0003
@0009@0014
Because Zephiel is the
treacherous king of Bern!@0003
It is said that he murdered
his own father.@0003
I don't expect he would be
moved by family trust...@0003
@000B@0080@000E@0013
He killed his own father?!@0003
@0009@0014Haven't you heard the rumors, Lord Roy?@0003
Zephiel took the throne because
his father, King Desmond, passed on.@0003
But King Desmond's death was
very sudden.@0003
@000C@0013So there are rumors...?@0003
@0009@0014...Yes, that Zephiel assassinated him.@0003
@000C...Does Princess Guinivere
know about this?@0003
@0009
I'm sure she is at least
aware of the rumors.@0003
She may even know the
whole story.@0003
@000C@0012@0016......@0003
[0986]
@000C@0010@01CD@0009@0010@01D7@0017
The Etrurian Army
marches toward us.@0003
@000CAll according to plan.@0003
Draw them closer. They will rue
the day they crossed our path.@0003
Have the other clans been
notified?@0003
@0009They have indeed.@0003
@000CGood.@0003
...The Etrurian Army will be an
easier foe than the Silver Wolf.@0003
They don't know this land.
They're unfamiliar with our ways.@0003
@0009The clans unite to fight against
foreign invaders.@0003
@000C
Yes, such is the law of Sacae.@0003
None aided us against the Silver Wolf
because it was a clan dispute.@0003
But this is a foreign invasion.@0003
@0009
The help from the other clans will
be valuable in this fight.@0003
With such a powerful ally as Bern,
however, they are expendable.@0003
@000CExactly.@0003
There are some, though, who dislike the idea
of involving Bern in Sacaen matters.@0003
@0009
I hear some clans have even joined
the Silver Wolf's guerrilla force.@0003
@000CHe is a stubborn halfwit.@0003
His clan was defeated. He should
know better than to oppose us.@0003
He knows what becomes of those
who try to fight against Bern.@0003
@0009
Bern has subdued even powerful
cities like Bulgar with ease.@0003
@000C
Yes, and if they cannot be beaten,
we have no choice but to join them.@0003
This is our only path, and the
law of Sacae is unbreakable.@0003
[0987]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Princess Guinivere...@0003
We are approaching
Bern's army.@0003
@0009...Yes, I know.@0003
@000C
As we get closer, we will clash with
soldiers of Bern more and more.@0003
It will not be long before we
are in full combat with Bern.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000C
I want to ask you something
before that happens.@0003
@0009Go ahead.@0003
@000C
I have heard rumors about
King Zephiel...@0003
I heard that he killed his father,
the previous king.@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0016!@0003
@000C@0016
I could scarcely believe it
myself.@0003
You believe in him so strongly that
you cast away your own country.@0003
If King Zephiel is truly as mad as
the rumors say,@0003
I'm sure you would not have done
all that you have.@0003
@0008@0016......@0003
@000C@0016Princess Guinivere,@0003
I accepted the Fire Emblem
not to use it in battle,@0003
but to find a way to end
this war peacefully.@0003
@0008Roy...@0003
@000CI think I have a right to know
the truth about the rumors...@0003
@0008I...I'm sorry.
Please...give me some time.@0003@0011
[0988]

[0989]

[098A]
@0080@0004@000C@0013@0017His own father told him that?!
What a heartless man!@0003
@0009@0014But Zephiel held strong.@0003
He always said he never cared about
inheriting the throne.@0003
But the people of Bern knew of
Zephiel's genius and wanted him king.@0003
Pressured by the public, our father
lost his patience at last...@0003
@000C@0013That's when he decided
to kill Zephiel...?@0003
@0009@0014
Our father gave Zephiel a goblet full
of a poisoned drink at a banquet.@0003
That was the first and last time Zephiel
ever accepted a drink from our father.@0003
After returning to his room, Zephiel
began to fall dreadfully ill.@0003
For ten days and nights, Zephiel
lingered between life and death.@0003
But Murdock, Zephiel's teacher and
loyal general, saved his life.@0003
@000C...The old king made no further
attempts on his life?@0003
@0009No. At least, not to completion...@0003
I have heard that he schemed to have
Murdock and Zephiel's mother killed.@0003
He was scheming to murder everyone
connected to Zephiel.@0003
Upon learning of our father's intentions,
Zephiel feigned death.@0003
At his funeral service, our father leaned
over the coffin to view Zephiel's body.@0003
It was at that moment that Zephiel sprung
from the coffin and...sword in hand...@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0014@0016
I was but a child then, so naturally
I could not understand what was going on.@0003
All I knew at the time is that our father
died, and Zephiel never smiled again.@0003
Before then, he was stern at times,
but always a kind and loving brother.@0003
But after everything that happened...@0003
@000C@0012Princess...@0003
@0009@0014
I knew that someday I may
have to act against him.@0003
@000C@0013I...see...@0003@0080@0004
@0009@0014
...Zephiel is so far-gone now.
He will never listen to anything I say.@0003
Roy, please...
You must stop him.@0003
Stop him from destroying Bern and
from destroying Elibe.@0003
@000C
Such a feat will likely
require my blade.@0003
Can you still ask such
a thing of me?@0003
@0009
...I trust your judgment.
Do what you must.@0003
@000C
You have my word,
Princess Guinivere.@0003
I swear by the Fire Emblem
that I will stop King Zephiel!@0003
[098B]
@0080@0004@000A@0080@000BWell, that sure got your
attention, didn't it?@0003
@000C@0017The dragons you speak of...@0003
They're not like the wyverns
that Bern's soldiers ride upon.@0003
They're strange troops that fight
alongside Bern's soldiers...@0003
@0009I know that well.@0003
They're the same dragons that
were defeated in the Scouring.@0003
@000C...Who are you, exactly?@0003
@0009I am Niime.@0003
I live in the mountains where I study
arcane magic.@0003
Some call me Niime the Hermit.@0003@0002
At first I thought this was only
a simple act of aggression by Bern.@0003
But then I began to sense a strange
and...evil force among their troops.@0003
I decided to investigate.@0003
@000CDid you learn anything?@0003
@0009The dragons are very much shrouded
in mystery.@0003
I looked through many ancient books
and scrolls.@0003
I could only decipher so many of them.
But...@0003
@000CBut...?@0003
@0009I have come to the conclusion that Bern
has resurrected the demon dragon.@0003
@000CThe demon dragon...@0003
The leader of the dragons
that Hartmut defeated.@0003
@0009The very same.@0003
Dragons are a much more advanced
species than us humans.@0003
Their vitality and intellect
puts that of humans to shame.@0003
There is one thing, however, the
dragons lack in.@0003
They multiply at a fraction of
the rate humans do.@0003
But the demon dragon...@0003
It had the power to create
more dragons.@0003
That is what I learned from
my research.@0003
@000CIt can make dragons...?@0003
@0009The demon dragon can create more
of its kind.@0003
That would explain where Bern is
getting all of its dragons.@0003
@000CThat seems likely.@0003
@0009@0017Now, that being said...@0003
I wish to learn more about
the dragons.@0003
I wield dark magic...
Let me join your army.@0003
I'm sure I can be of some
assistance.@0003
@000C@0017Of course.@0003
We want to learn about
the dragons as well.@0003
It will be a perilous journey,@0003
but if that's acceptable to you,
you're welcome to join us.@0003
[098C]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017A
The clans shall unite
to repel invaders...@0003
Such is the law
of Sacae.@0003
[098D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017A
Pray to the sky
and the earth...@0003
Such is the law
of Sacae.@0003
[098E]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017C
The clans will defend
against all invaders.@0003
Such is the law
of Sacae.@0003
[098F]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017C
Enemies will face the wrath
of the united clans...@0003
Such is the law
of Sacae.@0003
[0990]
@0010@01CDYes... That's it!
Closer... Closer...@0003@0002
Right into our trap!@0003
[0991]
@0010@01CD@0017Urkh...!
How could you defeat us...?@0003@0002
My trap...was...perfect...@0003
[0992]
@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017That was no easy feat.@0003
@000C
But now we've hit our
enemy in Sacae hard.@0003
I'm sure that's not the
last of them, though.@0003
@0009I'm sure they will
retaliate.@0003
@000CDo you have any idea
where they might be?@0003
@0009
Actually, the spy I sent out
earlier should be back by now.@0003
I will see if he's learned
anything.@0003@0011@0007@0080@0004
@0008@0010@0157@0016......@0003@0016
@000CIs something wrong,
Princess Guinivere?@0003
@0008@0080@000B...I wish to tell you
about my brother.@0003
@000C
...You don't mind?@0003
@0009No...@0003
I want you to know before
we enter Bern...@0003
I want you to know the
tragedies that have occurred.@0003
You asked before if my
brother murdered our father.@0003
@000CYes...?@0003
@0009To be frank...@0005
he did.@0003
@000C
King Zephiel killed his own
father to seize the throne...@0003
@0009@0080@000CNo!@0003
@000CNo?@0003
@000A
Our father tried to kill
Zephiel first.@0003
@000CWhat?!
Then King Zephiel...@0003
@000AHe couldn't bear the abuse
he took from our father.@0003
So he...@0003
@000CWhat...?
Why did--@0003@0080@0004
@0008@0010@0154...Lord Roy!@0003
We've located the enemy! They're
still planning their attack!@0003@0002
Hm? ...What is the matter?@0003@001C
@000AIt is nothing...
Perhaps later...@0003@0011@001C
@0008...Did I appear at
a bad time?@0003
@000CNo, it's fine.
Where are they planning?@0003
@0008@0080@000BIn the city of Bulgar.@0003
@000CBulgar...
I've heard of it.@0003
@0009
It's the largest city in Sacae, but
it's under Bern's control now.@0003
@000C
I understand. We'll move
as soon as we can.@0003@0009@0011
@000C...Why did the old king try
to murder his own son...?@0003
[0993]
@0009@0010@013D@0080@000B@0017
They're here...!
And so soon...@0003
If only we had more time
to prepare our defenses!@0003
@000C@0010@014E
We will try to stop the enemy
from progressing any further.@0003
Please retreat to the mansion
and fortify your defenses there.@0003
@0009...Do you think you can
succeed in stopping them?@0003
@000CI cannot say,
but we will try.@0003
@0009@0080@000B
If you aren't confident you'll
be victorious, then I'll--@0003
@000CYou'll what? Flee?@0003
Tell me, just where do
you think you can hide?@0003
@0009@0016......@0003@0016
@000C
General Brunnya has ordered
me to protect you.@0003
And so I shall, to the
very limits of my ability.@0003
But there may come a time when
you must take up arms as well.@0003
@0009...V-very well...@0003
Then I shall fortify the inside.
I leave the outside to you.@0003@0011@0006
@0009@0010@01D7
...That coward is the high
chancellor of Etruria?@0003
Why does he deserve our
protection?@0003
@000CIt's not as if General Brunnya
cares for the man.@0003
She is obligated to protect him
because he turned to our side.@0003
Wretched though he may be, we
have a duty to fulfill.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016
By the way, I understand the Silver
Wolf has been lurking around here.@0003
Keep on guard at all times and be
ready for anything.@0003
@0009Yes, sir.@0003
[0994]
@0009@0010@0157@000C@0010@0102@0017Princess Guinivere.@0003
@0009...We fight again today.@0003
@000CYes, we must.@0003
I am sorry I've had no time
to speak with you at length.@0003
@0009It is not your fault.@0003
...If the blame lies with
anyone, it is my brother.@0003
@000CPrincess...@0003
@0009...Yes?@0003
@000CMay I ask why your father tried
to murder King Zephiel?@0003
@0009...Zephiel and I have different mothers.
In actuality, I am his half sister.@0003
@000CI heard that Zephiel's mother
was an Etrurian noblewoman.@0003
@0009That's correct.@0003
They were arranged to be wed for
political reasons.@0003
However, our father was already
in love with another woman.@0003
That was my mother.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016
The marriage between the king and
Zephiel's mother was forced.@0003
Our father didn't love Zephiel's
mother and always resented their son.@0003
@000C
Was that the cause of all
the troubles that happened?@0003
@0009No...@0003
I remember Zephiel working hard,
vying for our father's affection.@0003
He was a brilliant scholar and a
prodigy in combat.@0003
He grew to become a fine heir
to Bern's throne.@0003
@000C@0080@000DThen why did the
king try to--@0003
@000DLord Roy!
We are ready for the attack!@0003
@000BUnderstood.
I only need a moment!@0003@0002
Princess Guinivere,
I am sorry, but I...@0003
@0009No, I understand. Go.
Please be careful.@0003
[0995]
@000B@0010@0124@0017
Well, well...
It begins.@0003
@000D@0010@0107So it seems.@0003
@0009@0010@017B
Bern's invasion finally ends, and now
here comes Etruria. Will it never end?@0003
@000D@0016......@0003@0016
@000BSmall wonder.
This is a large trading city.@0003
Any army would want control of it.@0003
If you'll excuse me...@0003
@0009H-hey, wait,
where are you going?@0003
@000BI'm going to observe the fight.
Let us see how good this Roy is.@0003
@0009You mean now?
But...@0003
@000BDon't you worry about me.
I'll be fine.@0003@0011
@000D@0011@0009What? Stop!
Don't leave me alone!@0003
[0996]
@0009@0010@014EThe reinforcements should be
arriving soon...@0003
@000C@0010@01D7@0009
Open the front gate to let the
reinforcements in when they arrive.@0003
@000CYes, sir.@0003
[0997]
@0009@0010@014E@000C@0010@01D7
@0009Have the guerrilla forces hiding in
the houses commence their attack.@0003
@000CYes, sir.@0003
[0998]
@0009@0010@01D7They'll be here any moment now...
Open the gate!@0003
[0999]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017B
I was selling weapons to Bern
before the war...@0003
But now that they've taken
over the city, they won't pay!@0003
Here, take this wyrmslayer.
Just do something about them.@0003@0002
I've been hiding it from them...
I think you can guess why...@0003
[099A]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@0179
Would you like a special ring
from Etruria?@0003
I used to sell them, but I had to
close my shop because of the war.@0003
Here, take it. No charge...
No one will buy it anyway.@0003
[099B]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017D
This goddess icon
brings good luck.@0003
...I used to con people
by saying that.@0003
I can't do business
with this war, though.@0003
Here, take one.@0003
It won't really bring
you any luck, though.@0003
[099C]
@000C@0010@017F
Wow... Lucky me!
Finders keepers.@0003
I bet I can sell
this thing...@0003
@0009@0010@FFFF
@000CWhoa!
A-are you from Bern?@0003
No, I didn't steal
this!@0003
See ya!@0003
[099D]
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@017E
This is a longbow, a favorite
of the Sacaen nomads.@0003
Here, take one.@0003
Use it to drive Bern's
soldiers out of here!@0003
[099E]
@0010@014EI am Kel.@0003@0002
Behold my blade...as I swing
it for the last time.@0003
[099F]
@0010@014E
This is the fate...
of all swordsmen...@0003
[09A0]
@000A@0010@0124@000C@0010@0102
@000AI must say, you're not
half bad at all.@0003
@000C@0017Wh-who are you!?@0003@001C
@0008@0010@0152I told you to stop!@0003
You may not enter.
Lord Roy is not accepting visitors.@0003
@000CWhat's going on?@0003
@0008
She was very insistent about
seeing you.@0003
But you have more important
matters to attend to.@0003@001C
@000A@0017Just hear me out first.@0003
I think I have some information
you might want to hear.@0003
@000C@0017...And what would that be?@0003
@000A@0017
It is about the dragons
who are in human form.@0003
@000C@0006@0017...I wish to speak
with her in private.@0003
Will you leave us, please?@0003
@001C@0008Yes, milord.@0003@0011
[09A1]
@000C@0010@013D@0017
The worthless fools outside failed!
The enemy is in the mansion!@0003
@0080@000EBlast it!@0003
If I die I'm taking
that Roy down with me!@0003
@0009@0010@01D7Lord Roartz!@0003
The remnants of the Djute say they'll come
to our aid after they hide Mulagir.@0003
@000CMulagir?@0005
Ah, one of the legendary weapons.@0003
Good. Then we must
simply hold out until then!@0003
[09A2]
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017This is Roartz's manor...@0003
@0009
This mansion's framework is big enough
to hide troops and ballistae.@0003
You won't be safe with your back up
against the wall.@0003
@000CDo you know much
about this place?@0003
@0009
Probably more than most, anyway.
That's what I'm known for.@0003
I picked up that bit of
information back in the city.@0003
@000C...Do you know what the
demon dragon looks like?@0003
@0009I can't say that I do.@0003
Still, I would relish the opportunity
to see it with my own eyes.@0003
@000CI've been wondering...@0003
Do you think the demon dragon
is in human form as well?@0003
@0080@0004@0009It seems probable.@0003
It could be that all dragons in
this realm are in human form.@0003
I've even heard stories of dragons
in human form living with people.@0003
@000C@0013Arcadia...@0003
@0009Hm?
What did you say?@0003
@000CEr, nothing.@0003
@0009I've read that dragons only began to take
human form after the Ending Winter.@0003
@000CThe Ending Winter...@0003
@0009I expect you've heard of it.@0003
@000CYes, but only in legend.@0003
I learned that in the Ending Winter,
the laws of nature were all warped.@0003
Day became night, and summer
became winter.@0003
@0009That's it.@0003
The scrolls I read on the topic are so timeworn
that I couldn't decipher all of them.@0003
But one thing is clear.@0003
The Ending Winter was a disaster powerful
enough to bend and twist the whole planet.@0003
@000CWhat caused it?@0003
@0009Nobody knows for certain...@0003
Legend says the dragons caused it by
releasing vast amounts of magical power,@0003
but even this theory lacks evidence.@0003
In any case, it is certain that dragons began
to take human form after the Ending Winter.@0003
I don't believe these two occurrences
are coincidence.@0003
@000CI agree.@0003
@0009@0017Ultimately,
the truth lies in Bern.@0003
[09A3]
@0009@0010@01CEPigs from Etruria...!@0003
I will avenge the Djute
right here, right now!@0003
[09A4]
@0009@0010@0107
The manor is in chaos.
Now is my chance.@0003
I will take down Bern's
troops on my own!@0003
[09A5]
@000C@0010@012C@0017
Soooo...@0003
Bulgar, huh? The biggest
city in Sacae.@0003
I heard it was sacked by Bern.
Look at all the soldiers...@0003
@0017I'm sure there are plenty of
goodies just waiting to be swiped.@0003
[09A6]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Are you the general of
the Etrurian Army?@0003
@000CI am. And you are?@0003
@0009I am Dayan.@0003
@000CDayan...?
I feel I've heard the name...@0003
@0009First, allow me to thank you.@0003
My clan has been fighting against
Bern and their followers.@0003
We haven't a chance against them
head on,@0003
so we've resorted to guerrilla
tactics.@0003
Since your arrival, however, the
odds are tipping in our favor.@0003
@000CI am glad that I could help.@0003
@0009That said, I wish to ask
you one thing.@0003
Once this battle is over,
I request that you withdraw.@0003
@000CAfter this battle?@0003
@0009Sacae belongs to the Sacaens.@0003
If Bern's iron-fisted rule is only
to be replaced by Etruria's,@0003
then you will leave us no choice
but to fight against you.@0003
@000C
I'm sorry... I cannot comply with
that request.@0003
We must base ourselves in Sacae to
launch our direct attack on Bern.@0003
@0009
You...plan to attack Bern directly?@0003
@000C
Even if we push Bern back now, it's only
a matter of time until they strike back.@0003
We must bring the fight to their heartland
to stop this war. Do you not agree?@0003
@0009Yes, I do.@0003
I see...@0003
In that case, I
shall join you.@0003
@000CThat would help tremendously.@0003
@0009But once Bern is defeated, you must
withdraw your troops from Sacae.@0003
Do I have your word?@0003
@000C@0017Of course.
I swear it.@0003
[09A7]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0106
@000C@0017Grandfather...@0003
@0009@0017Sue?!
You are unharmed?@0003
@000C@0017Thanks to this army, yes.@0003
But I was the only one of
our clansmen to survive...@0003
@0009I see... You've been
through much.@0003
@000CGrandfather, come with us.
This army will not invade Sacae.@0003
@0009...Are you certain?@0003
@000CAs certain as the Sky is blue
and the Earth is green.@0003
@0009Very well.
I trust your word.@0003
[09A8]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0105Chieftain!@0003
@0009Sin, you've returned!
Now you can join our fight...@0003
@000C@0017But Chieftain...@0003
I am currently in service
to this army.@0003
@0009...Do you mean the
Etrurian Army?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@000C@0016
This army will not invade Sacae.
Will you lend us your skills?@0003
@0009Very well.
I trust your word.@0003
I will fight with you.@0003
[09A9]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0106
@000C@0017Grandfather...@0003
@0009@0017Sue?!
You are unharmed?@0003
@000C@0017Thanks to this army, yes.@0003
But I was the only one of our
of our clansmen to survive...@0003
@0009I see... You've been
through much.@0003
@000CGrandfather, do you
fight with us?@0003
@0009Yes, I have joined this group.@0003
I don't believe that this army
will try to take Sacae from us.@0003
@000CI agree...@0003
[09AA]
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0105Chieftain!@0003
@0009Sin, you've returned!
We fight together again...@0003
@000C@0017Chieftain...@0003
Have you joined
this army?@0003
@0009I have indeed.@0003
I don't believe they intend
to take Sacae from us.@0003
What do you think of them?@0003
@000CI agree.
They mean well.@0003
@0009Good.
Then we fight together.@0003
@000CYes, Chieftain.@0003
[09AB]
@0010@013D@0017S-someone!
Come to my aid!@0003@0002
All is lost if I fall!@0003
[09AC]
@0010@013D@0017W-wait... Serve me!
It is not too late...@0003
I shall...absolve you
of your crimes...@0003@0002
Guh...!@0003
[09AD]
@000C@0010@0102
@000C@0017Next is Bern...@0003
@0009@0010@0154Lord Roy!@0003
We have reports that remnants of the
Djute are hiding in some nearby ruins.@0003
@000CRuins?@0003
@0009Yes, and a captive tells us there's a bow
there that was used in the Scouring.@0003
@000CWhat?
Then...@0003
@0009
It's likely that it's
a legendary weapon.@0003
@000CWe must get to those ruins!
Let's go!@0003
[09AE]
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0154
@000C@0017Merlinus, I need you to send this
letter to Father Yoder in Etruria.@0003
@0009A letter?
May I ask what it says?@0003
@000CIt has the information I learned
from Niime about the dragons.@0003
@0009Oh?@0003
What did you learn?@0003
@000C
It would take too long to tell you.@0003
I haven't sealed the letter yet, so
you can look through it if you like.@0003
@0009@0080@000A@0008@0013Very well.
I think I will...@0003@0011
@0008@0010@0157...Roy.@0003
@000CPrincess?@0003
@0008...We will enter Bern now.@0003
@000CYes, the attack on Bern
will commence soon.@0003
May I...ask the rest of
the story now?@0003
@0008@0080@000B...That is why I came to you.@0003
@000CYou said King Zephiel was an outstanding
pupil in everything he did...@0003
It sounds like he would have been an
ideal heir to the throne.@0003
@0009Yes, I have no doubt.@0003
@000C@0014
But still your father never
looked kindly at him.@0003
@0009In truth...our father began to despise
Zephiel precisely because of his talent.@0003
@000C@0012Why...would a father resent
his own son's talent...?@0003
@0009@0014
Our father was a man of
unextraordinary skill and intellect.@0003
Zephiel's outstanding talents made
our father colder towards him.@0003
@000C@0012He was envious...?@0003
@0009@0014
He went as far as to tell Zephiel
that he would never inherit Bern.@0003
He said that instead, the throne
would go to my future husband.@0003

with the people and was well-remembered
long after his tenure as Marquess Pherae.
[09CA]

as she did before the war. Her personality never

After returning to Nabata,
Fae was never heard from
again. Many historians are skeptical
that she even existed...

reunited clan. He was never a talkative one,
but with his leadership and skill with the
bow, he became known as the new Silver Wolf.
[09CD]

resumed her nomadic life.
She never accepted credit for her role in
the war and many said that her ability
rivaled that of the legendary Hanon.
[09CE]
Sue accompanied Roy to
Lycia, where they wed.
She could never cast away her love for
nature, however, and other nobility found
her behavior unusual.
[09CF]

with the surviving
members of the Kutolah. His efforts were not

the clan to greatness.

Saul turned it down and chose to serve
the people in his own way. His behavior

the faith of the St. Elimine
Church. He eventually rose to the position

Bern and lived his life in peace. Although many

travel around the world
and train her sword. She became known

set out to travel on his own. Independent, he

able to rid himself of the endless aspiring
knights begging for his instruction.

records. It was said that he supported

land and construct homes in the Isles. His work

His jolly personality ensured success, but
what really kept customers coming back were
the vivid stories of his valor in battle.

later helped rebuild the Lycian League into

declined them all and stayed independent.

magic skills ensured his legacy.
[09ED]

secluded home in the
mountains and continued her research. It was
rumored she solved many of the world's mysteries,
but she left no records so none can know for sure.
[09EE]
Raigh traveled the world,
studying more about magic.
Through Raigh's efforts, dark magic rose from
obscurity and became widely studied. He was well-
known for being hard on both himself and others.
[09EF]
Larum continued to
travel around the world
as a dancer. Her energetic dancing touched
the hearts of many and her unique style
was passed on through many generations.
[09F0]
Larum accompanied Roy
to Pherae where they wed.
Many voiced unease about a Lycian marquess
marrying a woman of common descent, but in
spite of the criticism, they were happy.
[09F1]

and lived the rest of her days with her family.

divided pegasus knights. Her diligent work

knights regained their former glory.

knighted and became a full-
fledged pegasus knight. Throughout her career,
she served in positions of leadership and
was eventually promoted to Flightleader.
[09F4]

as a pegasus knight and
went to Pherae with Roy, where they wed.
Rebuilding Lycia was never easy, but her
energy always encouraged everyone around her.

She continued to steal from the rich and
greedy and give it all to the poor. She

to Pherae, where the two
married. Despite her quiet nature, her
informed decisions assisted greatly in the
reconstruction of Lycia.
[09F9]
After returning to Nabata,
Sophia was never heard
from again. There are no records of Nabata
after the war, so none know how Sophia led
the rest of her life...
[09FA]
Melady returned home with
Guinivere to help rebuild
Bern. Her unbending will and hard work
earned Guinivere due respect, and Bern
began to regain its former prosperity.

When Gonzalez returned to
his home in the Western
Isles he was not greeted with the stones or
harsh words he was used to but instead with
cheers for the return of a great hero.
[09FC]
Wanting to test his
ability, Noah left
Zelot's group and traveled the world as a lone
mercenary. Several nations offered him positions
in their armies, but he turned them all down.
[09FD]
Trec remained a merce-
nary in Zelot's troop.
Despite being asleep half the time,
he made short work of any and all
who crossed his path in battle.
[09FE]
Zelot returned to
Ilia where he worked
to rebuild the land. He eventually united
Ilia into a kingdom and served as the
nation's first king.
[09FF]
Echidna returned to
her home in the Western
Isles, and the people were overjoyed to
welcome back their hero. Her hard work

Her calm judgment and leadership directed
Etruria to prosperity again and she came
to be known as the Daughter of Etruria.
[0A01]

Roy to Pherae where
she helped rebuild the battered land. The
two eventually wed, and she continued to
offer him close support as his wife.
[0A02]
Geese reopened his trade
routes and began to make
a profit. He donated nearly all of the money he
made to the Western Isles, which helped develop
the land, and he became known as the Ocean King.
[0A03]

Man and Dragon once coexisted in
harmony. However, Man shattered 
that harmony with a sudden onslaught.
A great war now known as The Scouring
was fought for dominion of the land.
Losses were tremendous for both sides
and this war rattled the very
foundations of the continent on
which they battled...
Defeated and humbled, the Dragons
disappeared from the realm.
Mankind then began to rebuild and 
repopulate their newly won land.
A millennium has passed since then...

A millennium has passed since then...
[0A72]
The Scouring...
The great war between dragons and men...@0003
[0A73]
The dragons were defeated
and disappeared from Elibe...@0003
[0A74]
Mankind celebrated victory and then
spread their forces throughout the continent...@0003
[0A75]
1000 years have passed...@0003
[0A76]
After defeating the dragons,
the humans of Elibe quickly spread their@0003
culture and civilization to the farthest
reaches of the continent.@0003
[0A77]
In the west lies the Kingdom of
Etruria, which is widely considered to@0003
possess the most refined culture
in all of Elibe.@0003
[0A78]
The Kingdom of Bern, with its powerful
military and logical, pragmatic people,@0003
is located on the other side of
the continent in the east.@0003
[0A79]
These are the two most powerful nations
in Elibe with the weaker nations@0003
situated between them.
These smaller lands are...@0003
[0A7A]
the Lycian League, whose numerous
territories are independently ruled@0003
by a number of marquesses that are 
bound by a vow of allegianceア@0003
[0A7B]
Ilia, where the people arduously
till the frozen soil and many@0003
become mercenaries to earn
money to surviveア@0003
[0A7C]
and Sacae, where various clans ride
through the plains on horseback.@0003
[0A7D]
Although there were occasional clashes
between these nations, the majority@0003
of the people of Elibe lived in peace.
That peace, however, was not to last...@0003
[0A7E]
King Zephiel of Bern has commanded his
forces to conquer the entirety of Elibe.@0003
[0A7F]
Bern's armies first attacked Sacae and Ilia,
ruthlessly massacring all who opposed them.@0003
@0080@0004Now, Bern is mounting a merciless
invasion into Lycia.@0003
[0A80]
Pherae is a territory of Lycia known for
its beauty and honorable lords.@0003
@0080@0004Pherae's Lord Roy was studying in the great
territory of Ostia when the invasion began.@0003
@0080@0004However, the sitting marquess and Roy's
father, Eliwood, who has been ill,@0003
has sent for Roy to return to lead Pherae's
soldiers in defending against Bern.@0003
[0A81]
@0080@0004Marquess Hector of Ostia is Eliwood's
long-time friend and confidant, and leads@0003
the council of lords in Lycia.
At the time Eliwood sent for Roy,@0003
@0080@0004Marquess Ostia's daughter Lilina
was in Pherae visiting Eliwood.@0003
[0A82]
Upon receiving his father's message, Roy
hurries home, taking with him his vassals@0003
@0080@0004and Bors, a knight from Ostia who is
responsible for Lilina's safety.@0003
[0A83]
The story begins when Roy reaches
the outskirts of Pherae...@0003
[0A84]

[0A85]

[0A86]

[0A87]

[0A88]

[0A89]

[0A8A]
There is a small village on the border
of Pherae and Bern.@0003
@0080@0004This is where Roy is to meet the
mercenary band that Eliwood hired.@0003
[0A8B]
Just east of the village is a small castle
occupied by Bern's forces.@0003
At the time Roy reaches the village,
the castle is in an outright panic.@0003
Roy has yet to realize that this confusion
going on in the castle will spread,@0003
engulfing the entire continent of Elibe
in chaos...@0003
[0A8C]

[0A8D]

[0A8E]

[0A8F]
Just north of Pherae stands
Castle Araphen.@0003
The armies of Lycia had gathered here to
make preparations to strike back at Bern.@0003
@0080@0004@0080@0004@0080@0004However, when Roy and Guinivere are only a
short distance from Castle Araphen,@0003
a messenger brings them shocking
news they can scarcely believe.@0003
Leading Bern's army is a trio of elite
commanders known as the Wyvern Generals,@0003
named after the reptilian creatures native
to Bern for their ferocity and cunning.@0003
[0A90]
@0080@0004@0080@0004Two of these three, Brunnya and
Narcian, have attacked Castle Araphen,@0003
virtually decimating the Lycian Army
while it was little prepared.@0003
[0A91]
@0080@0004Morale of the group takes a blow, but
Roy continues to Castle Araphen,@0003
both to see it for himself and, hopefully,
find and aid any survivors...
[0A92]

[0A93]

[0A94]

[0A95]

[0A96]

[0A97]

[0A98]
Respecting Hector's dying request,
Roy makes his way west.@0003
@0080@0004Intent on reaching Lilina, Roy
keeps a steady pace toward Ostia.@0003
@0080@0004On his way there, Roy passes through
the territory of Laus,@0003
@0080@0004governed by Lord Erik.@0003
At a glance, Laus is a peaceful territory
with vast meadows and clear streams.@0003
Beneath this beauty, however, lies
treachery and great skullduggery...@0003
[0A99]
Marquess Laus had been working with
Bern against his allies in Lycia.@0003
@0080@0004Roy realizes that the leaders of Lycia, his
homeland, can no longer be trusted.@0003
@0080@0004@0080@0004Still heading for Ostia, Roy moves through
a treacherous mountain pass...@0003
[0A9A]

[0A9B]

[0A9C]

[0A9D]

[0A9E]

[0A9F]
@0080@0004@0080@0004After taking Saul, a priest of St. Elimine,
and Dorothy, his bodyguard, into their ranks,@0003
@0080@0004@0080@0004Roy and company enter Thria,
southeast of Ostia.@0003
Thria is governed by Lord Orun,
Hector's cousin.@0003
[0AA0]
Orun's home castle seems a safe
place to stay.@0003
[0AA1]
As such, Roy expects a night of
quiet rest for his troops.@0003
However, even Thria is within Bern's
influence...@0003
[0AA2]

[0AA3]

[0AA4]

[0AA5]
Hearing of rebellion, Roy
hurries his pace towards Ostia.@0003
[0AA6]
@0080@0004According to his information,
General Legance, an advisor to Hector,@0003
@0080@0004organized a rebellion with his lieutenant,
Debias, to surrender to Bern.@0003
[0AA7]
Legance keeps Lilina hostage in Castle
Ostia, thinking she may be of use later.@0003
[0AA8]
Roy and company enter Ostia in an
effort to rescue Lilina.@0003
[0AA9]
Ostia, the largest and most populous city
in Lycia, is to become a battlefield...@0003
[0AAA]

[0AAB]
Lilina has been taken hostage by Legance.@0003
She is imprisoned within Castle Ostia, because
Legance thought he might find a use for her.@0003
[0AAC]

[0AAD]

[0AAE]
Ostia's military primarily consists of
soldiers in heavy armor.@0003
With them, Castle Ostia has
always been famously secure.@0003
@0080@0004For countless years, the castle has
been said to be impregnable.@0003
@0080@0004However, the rumors are about to be proven
wrong by Roy, who, ironically,@0003
only does so for the castle's
own protection...@0003
[0AAF]

[0AB0]

[0AB1]

[0AB2]

[0AB3]

[0AB4]

[0AB5]

[0AB6]

[0AB7]
Roy vowed to protect Lilina.@0003
With Bern coming full force however,
Roy's army is no equal.@0003
Therefore, he decides to try and
obtain a legendary weapon.@0003
He thinks it best to obtain it before
Bern manages to get their hands on it.@0003
Lilina shows them to a cave
on the outskirts of Ostia,@0003
where a legendary weapon is hidden.@0003
The cave, located at the foot of a volcano,
will be no small obstacle for Roy...@0003
[0AB8]

[0AB9]

[0ABA]
After driving Narcian away from Ostia,@0003
@0080@0004@0080@0004Roy and company brace themselves for
further attacks from Bern.@0003
However, Bern's belligerent movements
toward Lycia come to an abrupt halt,@0003
as if to mock Roy and his caution.@0003
Bern also remains unresponsive
to a treaty offer from Etruria.@0003
Bern's sudden silence and lack of
activity can only be described as eerie.@0003
[0ABB]
With Hector gone, Pherae is now the
greatest power in Lycia.@0003
Eliwood summons the council of marquesses
to Pherae to discuss future actions.@0003
@0080@0004It is decided that Eliwood is to lead
the council of the Lycian League.@0003
A new Lycian Army is also to
be established.@0003
This new army's purpose is not to
take the offensive against Bern,@0003
but rather take a defensive
stance for Lycia.@0003
@0080@0004Owing to his victory against Bern in Ostia,
Roy is chosen leader of this new army.@0003
Gradually, the attitude and morale in
Lycia begins to improve.@0003
People once again conduct business without
fear, and they embrace a new optimism.@0003
[0ABC]
At this time, Etruria calls for Lycia's
assistance.@0003
@0080@0004The kingdom needs help with restoring
law to the Western Isles.@0003
Many outlaws make their bases there,
and anarchy is said to rule.@0003
[0ABD]
Many in Lycia are uneager to send their
troops to the Isles to deal with bandits,@0003
but having received Etruria's aid in Ostia,
they have no choice but to oblige.@0003
@0080@0004Thus, Roy and the Lycian Army pass
through Etruria toward the Isles.@0003
[0ABE]
The Western Isles are the numerous
islands off the western coast of Elibe.@0003
Presently, they are colonies of Etruria.@0003
The Western Isles are rich in resources,
so mining is a major industry here.@0003
However, these resources are
worth a fortune.@0003
@0080@0004Inevitably, varied bands of rogues traveled
there hoping to loot the mines.@0003
As such, the people of the Western Isles
live in constant fear of bandit attacks.@0003
Roy is sent to vanquish these bandits...@0003
[0ABF]
Roy accompanies Cecilia to the
Etrurian capital of Aquileia.@0003
[0AC0]
After debating Roy and Guinivere's positions,
the Etrurian Court hands down a decision.@0003
[0AC1]
They decide there is no justification to attack
Bern as they have not been attacked directly.@0003
[0AC2]
Guinivere is to stay under Etrurian
protection at Aquileia,@0003
and the Lycian Army is to be an independent
part of Etruria's military.
[0AC3]
To test his worth, Etruria sends Roy
to the Western Isles,@0003
[0AC4]
on a mission to rid the islands
of the spreading bandits.@0003
[0AC5]
The Western Isles is an archipelago to
the west under Etrurian jurisdiction.@0003
[0AC6]
Many mining companies have sprouted up to
take advantage of the rich resources there.@0003
[0AC7]
However, these riches also inevitably
attracted many bandits to the area,@0003
[0AC8]
and now the people live in
constant fear...@0003
[0AC9]

[0ACA]
Three separate islands:@0003
@0080@0004Fibernia,@0003
[0ACB]
@0080@0004Caldonia,@0003
[0ACC]
@0080@0004and Dia.@0003
All of these islands are rich in minerals,
and mining is the economic backbone.@0003
@0080@0004The largest mine is located in
Eburacum, in north Fibernia.@0003
@0080@0004Roy leads his forces toward Eburacum
hoping to learn more about the bandits.@0003
[0ACD]
To get to Eburacum, one must pass a
castle located nearby.@0003
@0080@0004Roy sends a messenger to Sir Nord,
lord of the castle,@0003
to request permission to
pass through his lands.@0003
Because Roy and company are in
the Isles on Etruria's request,@0003
they don't anticipate trouble in
gaining Nord's support.@0003
But not everything is as
simple as it appears...@0003
[0ACE]
Roy can hardly believe Larum's account.@0003
@0080@0004He quickly pens a letter to Cecilia to let
her know of the horrors on the Isles.@0003
He also tells her of the actions he
plans to take from this point.@0003
@0080@0004After sending the letter, Roy moves
towards the Eburacum mine.@0003
[0ACF]
His goal is to rescue the people
suffering from forced labor.@0003
@0080@0004Etruria has assigned Bishop Orlo of the
St. Elimine Church to supervise the mine.@0003
It was already a fruitful endeavor, but
the nobles' greed is unsatiable.@0003
[0AD0]
Eburacum... Known now as the Mine of Death.@0003
The wails of the people forced into
labor echo through the mines,@0003
like the howling of ghosts,
never sleeping...@0003
[0AD1]

[0AD2]

[0AD3]

[0AD4]
@0080@0004In order to speak to the resistance
force about the bandits on the Isles,@0003
Roy and company move west along
the coastline.@0003
[0AD5]
Along the way, they come across
a small village caught in conflict.@0003
The local lord oppresses the resistance and
does anything he can to get rid of them...@0003
[0AD6]

[0AD7]

[0AD8]
The Lycian Army takes Elffin in
as an advisor.@0003
@0080@0004Following his advice, they move south
toward the isle of Caldonia.@0003
Caldonia is one of the main islands
that make up the Western Isles,@0003
the other two being Fibernia and Dia.@0003@0080@0004
[0AD9]
Castle Eidyna is located on Caldonia. Here,
men from all over the Isles are imprisoned,@0003
awaiting transport to Eburacum,
the Mine of Death.@0003
[0ADA]
When Roy arrives at Castle Eidyna,
the situation appears dire...@0003
[0ADB]

[0ADC]
To liberate the people of the Western Isles,
Roy heads for Juteaux,@0003
the Isles' largest city and its capital.@0003

[0ADD]
According to Elffin, Lord Arcardo, who is
in charge of overseeing the Western Isles,@0003
is an Etrurian of high nobility but of little
prominence in the Etrurian court.@0003
[0ADE]
Roy, still wary of how Etruria may
respond to his attack,@0003
@0080@0004prepares his soldiers to rid the Isles
of Arcardo to rescue the people...@0003
[0ADF]

[0AE0]

[0AE1]

[0AE2]

[0AE3]

[0AE4]
Following Elffin's guidance,@0003
Roy heads for a cave near Juteaux
to obtain a legendary weapon.@0003
[0AE5]
But Roy and company aren't the
only ones who know of the cave.@0003
Yet another battle awaits them...@0003
[0AE6]

[0AE7]

[0AE8]
The chaos caused by the coup in Aquileia
quickly spreads to the rest of Etruria.@0003
[0AE9]
Cecilia escapes with Guinivere
from Aquileia.@0003
She also forms a loyalist group to
combat the revolutionaries.@0003
@0080@0004The revolutionaries, however,
have Bern on their side.@0003
@0080@0004King Mordred has also been taken hostage,
giving the revolutionaries another edge:@0003
@0080@0004@0080@0004@0080@0004Great General Douglas and Knight General 
Perceval are forced into their service.@0003
With so much power, the revolutionaries
easily push the loyalists out of Etruria.@0003
[0AEA]
@0080@0004The loyalists are driven into an old
castle on the Missur Peninsula.@0003
[0AEB]
Roy learns that Cecilia has been
forced back by the revolutionaries.@0003
[0AEC]
In response, Roy heads for Missur.@0003
[0AED]
The loyalists are under attack by both
revolutionaries and Bern's military.@0003
With such adversity, the loyalists'
forces have little time...@0003
[0AEE]

[0AEF]

[0AF0]

[0AF1]

[0AF2]

[0AF3]
After Roy rescues Cecilia,@0003
@0080@0004he obliges Sophia's request and
heads into the Nabata desert.@0003
[0AF4]
According to Sophia, her village,
Arcadia, is located in a hidden oasis.@0003
The village is under attack by Bern,@0003
and Roy believes their aim to be the
dragons said to inhabit the village.@0003

[0AF5]
The Lycian Army moves quickly to Arcadia,
but a sandstorm impedes their progress...@0003
[0AF6]
In the hidden village of Arcadia
stands an ancient temple.@0003
One of the legendary weapons
is said to be hidden within.@0003
Roy and company are hot on the
trail of Bern's troops,@0003
who have already made their
way into the temple...@0003
[0AF7]

[0AF8]

[0AF9]

[0AFA]
After saving the village of Arcadia,@0003
Roy's army leaves the desert by
following Igrene's lead.@0003
@0080@0004Now, they turn toward Etruria to confront
the revolutionary forces.@0003

[0AFB]
However, they receive a troubling
letter from the elder of Arcadia.@0003

[0AFC]
Apparently, Fae the dragon has
left Arcadia in pursuit of Roy.@0003
If she falls into the hands of the
revolutionaries or Bern,@0003
there is no telling what might
happen to her, or to Roy's army.@0003

[0AFD]
Determined to find Fae, Roy moves to
a small fort on the Etrurian border...@0003
[0AFE]

[0AFF]

[0B00]
@0080@0004After rescuing Fae,
Roy heads for Aquileia.@0003
[0B01]
The capital of Etruria,@0003
Aquileia is also the largest and
wealthiest city on the continent.@0003
@0080@0004Prepared for the Lycian Army's attack,@0003
the revolutionary forces are
fortified in Aquileia.@0003
@0080@0004The St. Elimine Church supports the Lycian
Army, turning popular opinion against@0003
the revolutionaries, forcing them
inside the castle.@0003
[0B02]
The St. Elimine Church was founded by Saint
Elimine, one of the Eight Legends.@0003
@0080@0004The church has legions of followers,
particularly in Bern and Etruria.@0003
@0080@0004Roy's attack on Aquileia is
supported by the church.@0003
@0080@0004However, Narcian and his elite troops
await Roy inside the castle...@0003

[0B03]

[0B04]

[0B05]

[0B06]

[0B07]

[0B08]

[0B09]
At the request of King Mordred, Roy heads
for the Saint's Tower outside Aquileia.@0003
@0080@0004The Saint's Tower was once a place of
worship for Saint Elimine.@0003
In the tower lay numerous sacred relics
relating to her.@0003
@0080@0004However, this sacred tower is now
under the control of the revolutionaries.@0003
@0080@0004Bishop Windham now occupies the tower after
betraying the St. Elimine Church...@0003
[0B0A]
After Roy captures Aquileia, other
Etrurian forces flock to the loyalists,@0003
forcing out the revolutionaries.@0003
@0080@0004@0080@0004@0080@0004Roartz and Arcardo are driven out of
Etruria.@0003
@0080@0004They flee north to Ilia,
which is under Bern's control.@0003
Ilia, the frozen highlands, is a
land with short summers and long winters.@0003
[0B0B]
With so little arable land,@0003
the nation's main source of
income is mercenary contracts.@0003
[0B0C]
The now free Kingdom of Etruria
joins forces with the Lycian Army.@0003
Now a joint force under the name of the
Etrurian Army,@0003
@0080@0004their first mission is to enter Ilia
and finish off the revolutionaries.@0003
@0080@0004After that, they plan to launch a
direct attack on Bern.@0003
@0080@0004Roy, nominated as leader of
the Etrurian Army,@0003
has the powerful support of
the St. Elimine Church.@0003
With the church's support comes
also the support of the people.@0003
[0B0D]
However, Roy has to face not only
the freezing cold of Ilia,@0003
@0080@0004but also the elite troops under
Murdock, head of Bern's Wyvern Generals.@0003
Even worse, many skilled mercenary
knights of Ilia have sided with Bern.@0003
@0080@0004To begin, Roy heads for Castle Remi,
located on the Ilian border...@0003
[0B0E]

[0B0F]

[0B10]

[0B11]

[0B12]

[0B13]

[0B14]

[0B15]

[0B16]

[0B17]
After defeating Arcardo, Roy moves
east, deep into the frozen lands of Ilia.@0003
@0080@0004He soon enters the thick forests
that characterize central Ilia.@0003
@0080@0004@0080@0004However, a commander of Bern,
Bishop Martel, lies in wait.@0003
In his possession is an ancient spell
said to have been lost centuries ago...@0003

[0B18]

[0B19]

[0B1A]

[0B1B]

[0B1C]

[0B1D]
After defeating Martel and making it
through the woodlands,@0003
@0080@0004Roy and company face the blizzards
common of Ilia's winters.@0003
@0080@0004Ilia's harsh weather has in the past served
as a natural defense against invaders.@0003
@0080@0004@0080@0004In this blizzard, Sigune, captain of a
pegasus knight squad working for Bern,@0003
makes preparations to attack
Roy and his troops...@0003
[0B1E]

[0B1F]

[0B20]

[0B21]

[0B22]
After defeating Sigune,@0003
@0080@0004Roy heads for Edessa,
located in the northeast of Ilia.@0003
[0B23]
@0080@0004Castle Edessa, home of Zelot, leader of
the Ilian mercenary knights,@0003
once served as headquarters of the
pegasus knight mercenaries as well.@0003
@0080@0004However, with Zelot's absence, Bern saw
its chance and attacked the castle,@0003
forcing the mercenaries and pegasus
knights into submission.@0003
@0080@0004Murdock had made the castle his base,
but after he returned to Bern,@0003
@0080@0004High Chancellor Roartz was put in charge.@0003
Alarmed by the Etrurian Army's
speedy advance to Edessa,@0003
Roartz hurriedly contacts the various
Ilian mercenary groups for aid.@0003
Unfortunately for him, however,
their replies are not promising...@0003
[0B24]

[0B25]

[0B26]

[0B27]

[0B28]

[0B29]

[0B2A]
After taking back Castle Edessa,@0003
Roy turns his troops toward the ancient
ruins on the outskirts of the town.@0003
A legendary weapon is said to be
hidden within...@0003

[0B2B]

[0B2C]

[0B2D]

[0B2E]
After Roy captures Aquileia, powers
in Etruria turn against the revolution.@0003
Driven away from the palace,@0003
@0080@0004@0080@0004@0080@0004Roartz and Arcardo flee to Sacae,
which remains under Bern's control.@0003
[0B2F]
Sacae lies in the center of the
continent and is covered in plains.@0003
Before Bern's invasion, it was
home to numerous nomadic clans.@0003
[0B30]
The Etrurian Army joins the Lycian
Army to form a unified force.@0003
@0080@0004The decision is made for this army
to head for Sacae with dual purpose.@0003
The first is to eliminate the remnants
of the revolution,@0003
@0080@0004and the second is to begin an
offensive against Bern.@0003
@0080@0004Realizing that Etrurian soldiers may
not fight under the Lycian banner,@0003
Roy formally decides to call his
force the Etrurian Army.@0003
Roy is to lead the division that
will begin the offensive in Sacae.@0003
[0B31]
The people of Sacae are wary of
outsiders, which is challenge enough,@0003
@0080@0004but Brunnya, one of Bern's
three Wyvern Generals,@0003
has the Djute, the largest clan in
Sacae, under her control.@0003
@0080@0004With the warriors of the Djute and
Brunnya's elite troops in his way,@0003
Roy knows it is unlikely he will find
any respite in this foreign land...@0003
[0B32]

[0B33]

[0B34]

[0B35]

[0B36]

[0B37]

[0B38]

[0B39]

[0B3A]

[0B3B]
After defeating Arcardo,@0003
@0080@0004Roy crosses the border and
enters the land of Sacae.@0003
The Djute, the most powerful clan in
Sacae, serve Bern unbendingly.@0003
All clans who have stood against these
two joint forces have faced decimation.@0003
@0080@0004The chieftain of the Kutolah clan,
the famed Silver Wolf Dayan,@0003
does lead a guerrilla resistance,
but to disappointingly little effect.@0003
@0080@0004With none to oppose them, Bern essentially
has full control over Sacae.@0003
@0080@0004As Roy sets foot on the plains,
the Djute wait to strike...@0003
[0B3C]

[0B3D]

[0B3E]

[0B3F]

[0B40]

[0B41]

[0B42]

[0B43]
After defeating the Djute,@0003
@0080@0004Roy moves toward Bulgar,
the largest city in Sacae.@0003
[0B44]
As a center of commerce between
Etruria, Bern and Ilia,@0003
Bulgar has a history of being a
free city without rule.@0003
@0080@0004However, High Chancellor Roartz now holds
control of Bulgar with Bern's support.@0003
[0B45]
@0080@0004Roy enters Bulgar with the hopes of
liberating it and learning more...@0003
[0B46]

[0B47]

[0B48]
After Roy meets Niime the Hermit,
some light is shed on Bern's dragons.@0003
With many questions still left
unanswered,@0003
@0080@0004Roy directs his troops towards a large
manor on the edge of Bulgar.@0003
[0B49]
Here, High Chancellor Roartz prepares
his defenses for his last stand...@0003
[0B4A]

[0B4B]
Roy heads toward the ruins in Sacae
hoping to secure a legendary weapon.@0003
@0080@0004@0080@0004However, the remnants of the
Djute wait for Roy within...@0003 
[0B4C]

[0B4D]

[0B4E]
After surviving many hardships,
Roy finally sets foot on Bern's soil.@0003
[0B4F]
@0080@0004Guinivere guides Roy to the
Shrine of Seals.@0003
@0080@0004In their way stands Murdock, the brilliant
and stalwart head of the Wyvern Generals.@0003
[0B50]
Etruria and Bern, the two greatest forces
on the continent, begin direct warfare.@0003
The sun rises as the bloodiest day in
the history of Elibe dawns...@0003
[0B51]

[0B52]

[0B53]

[0B54]
Roy ventures into the depths of
the Shrine of Seals.@0003
Apparently, the shrine contains
more than just the Binding Blade.@0003
@0080@0004@0080@0004However, Peres, one of Murdock's best
commanders, waits for Roy within...@0003
[0B55]

[0B56]

[0B57]
@0080@0004After obtaining the Binding Blade,
Roy directs his troops to Bern's capital.@0003
@0080@0004@0080@0004
King Zephiel awaits within, along with
his personal guard.@0003
[0B58]
Roy prepares to charge the castle
to end the war,@0003
and to bring a long-awaited peace
back to Elibe...@0003
[0B59]

[0B5A]

[0B5B]

[0B5C]
Bern surrenders with King Zephiel's death.@0003
The great war that rattled the foundations
of Elibe is over.@0003@0080@0004
Roy's battle, however, is not.@0003
[0B5D]
Roy continues his search for the Dark
Priestess, believed to be the demon dragon.@0003
@0080@0004Following the legendary weapons' light,
Roy heads for the Dragon Sanctuary.@0003
@0080@0004@0080@0004However, waiting for Roy at the entrance
to the sanctuary is Brunnya,@0003
the last surviving Wyvern General
of Bern.@0003
With the remaining troops of Bern at her
command, she awaits Roy's approach.@0003
[0B5E]
With a heavy heart, Roy prepares to
fight the ghost of the now dead Bern...@0003
[0B5F]

[0B60]
lcaring.@0003
@000CI see...@0003
Juno was pretty worried about
you and Shanna.@0003
Knowing you, I would think you'd
be all right.@0003
But you know Juno,
she's a worrier.@0003@0009Yes, I understand.@0003
Our sister was often too soft
on Shanna and me.@0003
The day we left was a hectic one,
indeed.@0003
Juno was constantly fretting over
us, worrying about our meals, and@0003
our clothes...@0003
@000C@0017Haha, that's Juno.@0003
[0B61]

[0B62]

[0B63]

[0B64]

[0B65]

[0B66]
After defeating Bern's remaining
troops, Roy enters the Dragon Sanctuary.@0003
@0080@0004@0080@0004@0080@0004He searches for the Dark Priestess
to prevent a repeat of the Scouring.@0003
[0B67]
Here in the sanctuary, Roy will learn
the truth of the legendary dragons.@0003
All he knows is about to be proven
wrong...@0003
[0B68]

[0B69]

[0B6A]

[0B6B]
The Lycian League. Land of numerous
territories and ruling lords.@0003
[0B6C]
Roy, son of the marquess of the
Pherae territory,@0003
[0B6D]
is studying in the great city of Ostia
to become a worthy heir.@0003@0080@0004
Today, his instructor, General Cecilia
of the Kingdom of Etruria,@0003

One thousand years after the great
war between dragon and man known
as the Scouring...
@0005 
[0BCE]
Mankind is prospering
once more.@0005 
[0BCF]
However, a sudden aggression
from the east throws the
continent into war.@0005 
[0BD0]
Some ally with the aggressors...
Some lose everything from them...
Some stand against them...@0005
[0BD1]
Countless people fight to
their deaths to protect what
they believe in.@0005 
[0BD2]
This is a story of a band of heroes
during this age of suffering who
will be remembered forever...@0005 
[0BD3]
@0009@0010@0150@000C@0010@01CB@0009@0017B-Boss!
An army's in the cave!@0003
@000CWhat?!@0003
How many of them are there?@0003
@0009Dunno, Boss.
Not too many, I hope...@0003
@000CIt's strange, though...@0003
The lords of Lycia have bigger fish
to fry than bandits like us.@0003
@0009Well?
What do we do?@0003
@000CI don't expect they know
much about this cave.@0003
Just lure them onto the lava
geysers and get rid of 'em.@0003
[0BD4]
@0009@0010@0122@0009@0017Roy, this way!@0003
The legendary weapon is on the other
side of this flaming crevice.@0003
@000C@0010@0102Lilina, are you all right? Have you
already come to terms with everything?@0003
@0009@0017Well...@0017maybe not just yet.
But I can't afford to be in sorrow.@0003
Ostia needs me to protect it, just
as it needed my father before me.@0003
@000C@0017I'm just glad you're
all right, Lilina.@0003@000C@0011
@0009Only because you're
with me, Roy...@0003
@000C@0010@0102@0017What?@0003
Did you just say something?@0003
@0009@0017No, nothing.@0003
Let me tell you what I know
about the weapon.@0003
The sword here was used by Roland
himself, one of the Eight Legends.@0003
@000C@0017Roland...
The first marquess of Ostia?@0003
@0009@0017Exactly. He's my ancestor.@0003
This sword is called Durandal,
the Blazing Blade.@0003
@000C@0017Durandal... The name has a
strange echo to it.@0003
So Roland used Durandal to fight
the dragons during the Scouring?@0003
@0009@0017That's how the legend goes.@0003
They also say that after the war ended,
Roland returned to his home of Ostia.@0003
He raised Durandal high above his head,@0003
and the earth scorched by the flames of
war suddenly blossomed with life again.@0003
@000C@0017Wow... That sword has
quite the story to it.@0003
@0009@0017It's a weapon that can defeat dragons,
so it must have some exceptional powers.@0003
@000C@0017...Oh, yes. I heard that a group
of bandits has made its base here.@0003
Will the sword be all right? Might the
bandits have taken Durandal?@0003
@0009@0017Oh, no, don't worry
yourself about that.@0003
Only descendants of Roland know how to
remove Durandal from its sheath.@0003
@000CThat's reassuring.@0003
@0017All that's left then is to rid this cave
of the bandits and take Durandal.@0003
[0BD5]
@0010@01CB@0017Sigh.@0003
How did you find
yourselves in here?@0003
I'm afraid I can't
let you go.@0003
[0BD6]
@0010@01CB@0017Ah, blast...@0003
I knew this would happen...@0003
[0BD7]
@0009@0010@0122@0017Roy!
Here it is!@0003
@000C@0010@0102@0017So this is Durandal...
It's enormous.@0003
I don't think many of us will
be able to swing it.@0003
@0009History has it that Roland
was a small man.@0003
Any fighter skilled enough should be
able to wield the sword.@0003
@000CThen if I become better with the
sword, I could use it as well?@0003
@0009Well... I don't
know about that.@0003
@000COh, come now.@0003
Have SOME confidence
in me, at least!@0003
@0009Hee hee!@0003
[0BD8]
@0009@0010@0154@0017Lord Roy, we have it!
It was under the altar.@0003
It was no simple task to get it out,
but it's in our possession now.@0003
@000C@0010@0102This is Durandal...@0003
But was it worth
Lilina's life...?@0003
[0BD9]
@000C@0010@01D3@0017This is the end of the caaave?@0003
Treasuuure...
Where are yooouu...?@0003
Answer meee...@0003
@0009@0010@0150
Boss... Are you sure
about this?@0003
The men from Bern just told
us to block the entrance.@0003
If they catch us now, they'll
surely have us back in chains!@0003
@000C@0080@000DYou foooool!@0009@0080@000A@0003
@000BWe'll do as we're told in tiiime...@0003
They'll never know that we took
the treasuuure...@0003
If we block the entrance without taking
the treasure, it's all the same anywaaay...@0003
Do you really want that poor treasure
trapped in here for all eternityyy?@0003
@0008Well, when you put it that way...
I guess you're right.@0003
@0008@0011@0009@0010@0151Boss!@0003
There's an army stationed
outside the cave!@0003
@000BWhaaat?@0003
They want to take our
treasure, do theeey?@0003
Have the boys near the entrance
take them ooouut...@0003
And grab all the treasure cheeests...
We rightfully stole them fiiirst!@0003
[0BDA]
@000C@0010@0102@0017A legendary weapon lies in this cave...?@0003
It's so dark in here.@0003
@0009@0010@012BAccording to the scholar in
Juteaux I spoke to,@0003
the legendary weapon in this cave is
most likely the Thunder Axe, Armads.@0003
@000CArmads...@0003
An axe this time.@0003
@0009Armads was wielded by Durban the Berserker,
who was said to be a colossus of a man.@0003
A single blow from his axe surely made
short work of any opponent.@0003
@000CElffin, you seem to know a lot about
the Eight Legends and their weapons.@0003
@0009I'm a bard. It is my job
to know myths and legends.@0003
@000CI'd like to hear some of them
when we have the time.@0003
@0009Of course.@0003
...Lord Roy, it seems we are
not alone in this cave.@0003
@000CWe aren't?@0003
@0009There are also noxious fumes
coming from the cave walls.@0003
We must tread lightly.@0003
[0BDB]
@0010@01D3Daaaahhhhhh!@0003@0002
Rah!@0003
[0BDC]
@0010@01D3Dah...@0003
[0BDD]
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0102@0017Where is the legendary weapon?@0003
@0009Hmm...@0003
I hear wind blowing from
behind the throne.@0003
@000CWhat?
I can't hear it...@0003
@0080@000DA niche...between the
floor and the wall.@0003@0002
Oh! It opened!@0003@0002
...So this is the legendary weapon?
This axe is enormous.@0003
@0009Armads...@0003
The very axe wielded by
Durban the Berserker.@0003
It certainly appears fit for
a warrior of his stature.@0003
[0BDE]
@0009@0010@0152@0017Lord Roy, here it is!@0003
There's a large axe behind the
throne!@0003
@000C@0010@0102This is Armads...
Durban's axe...@0003
[0BDF]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@01C6@0017Haven't you found the
legendary weapon yet?!@0003
@0009We believe it is inside this
altar, but we can't get it open...@0003
@000C@0080@000DBreak it open if you have to!
It doesn't matter!@0003
@0009@0080@000AThe enemy has already entered the temple,
so the men are all preparing for battle!@0003
We don't have the manpower to break it
open right now!@0003
@000BBlasted distractions...
We don't have time for this.@0003
As soon as the enemy is defeated, locating
the weapon is our highest priority.@0003
[0BE0]
@000C@0010@0102@0017This is what it looks like
under the desert?@0003
There's so much...water.@0003
@0009@0010@012DThis is close to a source
of groundwater...@0003
This is the reason plants and animals
can live in our village...@0003
@000CSo this is the source
of the oasis.@0003
Still, how did you find such
an ideal location?@0003
@0009Athos...@0003
Archsage Athos
led us here...@0003
@000C@0017
You mean the Athos of the
Eight Legends?@0003
@0009@0017Yes...@0003
After the Scouring...Archsage Athos
traveled all across Elibe...@0003
At the end of his journey, he discovered
our village of both man and dragon...@0003
He told us it was only a matter of time
until we were discovered...@0003
@000CSo he brought you into the desert
where you could stay hidden...@0003
@0009Yes... He concealed his legendary
weapon within this temple...@0003
@000CWill your village permit us to
use this legendary weapon?@0003
@0009The Archsage said that we were to
use his weapon to protect Arcadia...@0003
As long as you use it...to save Elibe
and to protect us...then of course...@0003
@000CIt will be invaluable.
Thank you.@0003
@0009Some of the pathways in this temple
will sink into the water without warning...@0003
Please be careful...@0003
[0BE1]
@0010@01C6@0017I...wasn't expecting you to
put up such a fight.@0003
[0BE2]
@0010@01C6@0017Where...did you learn...
to fight...like this...?@0003
[0BE3]
@0009@0010@012D@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017It is here...
Inside this altar...@0003
@000C@0080@000D@0016......@0003@0016@0002
It won't open...@0003
@0009Only those of the village
may open the altar...@0003
Please allow me...@0003
@000B@0080@000EOf course.@0003
@0009@0080@000C@0016......@0003@0007@0002
@0016There...
This is the legendary weapon.@0003
@000CAthos used this?
Then it's...@0003
@000AYes... It is the Infernal Truth.
Forblaze...@0003
[0BE4]
@0009@0010@0152@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017
The tome appears to be inside
the altar, Lord Roy.@0003
@000CCan you get it out?@0003
@0009I sent some people to ask the
villagers about it.@0003
@000CThank you, but let's not
force the issue.@0003
If they will not give us permission to
use it, then we leave it here.@0003
@0009Yes, milord.@0003@0011
[0BE5]
@0009@0010@0152@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017Lord Roy!@0003
The villagers helped us remove
the tome from the altar!@0003
Here it is.@0003
@000CWhat is it?@0003
@0009@0011@0009@0010@012B
...If this is what Archsage Athos used, it
must be Forblaze, the Infernal Truth.@0003
The legends say that none could
escape its fiery punishment.@0003
@000C...We must use it
cautiously then.@0003
[0BE6]
@0009@0010@01D7@000C@0010@01D5@0017Lord Roartz fled?!@0003
What of me?! I betrayed the church and
took control of this tower on his order!@0003
@0009Lord Roartz's message said he leaves
us to fend for ourselves.@0003
Because we were unable to bend the church
to his side, he has no more use for us.@0003
@000C
This is all Yoder's fault. If he hadn't
meddled in my affairs...@0003
@0009
I agree...but that's the least
of our worries right now...@0003
@000C...Very well...
Then this is our last stand.@0003
If we are to die, then the Lycian
Army shall fall along with us!@0003
Prepare the Heavenly Arrows!@0003
@0009But sir, we'll be unable to avoid
hitting our own men as well!@0003
@000C@0080@000DYou know the consequences for dissent.
You shall do as I say!@0009@0080@000A@0003@0008@0011
@000B...They'll regret crossing me...
Heh heh heh...!@0003
[0BE7]
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017This is the Saint's Tower.@0003
Saint Elimine's legendary weapon, the
Aureola spell tome, lies within.@0003
@000CThank you, Sir Douglas.
I appreciate your help.@0003
Especially because we were fighting
on opposite sides earlier...@0003
@0009You need not thank me.@0003
I do as my king commands.
There is nothing more to it.@0003
@000C@0016......@0003
@0009@0016
That said, you saved Etruria. I am
honored to fight alongside you.@0003
@000CSir Douglas...@0003
[0BE8]

[0BE9]
@0010@01D5Perish!
Every last one of you!@0003@0002
Everything to ash!@0003
[0BEA]
@0010@01D5Hahaha!
Haha...ha...@0003
[0BEB]
@0009@0010@0152@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017Lord Roy,
I think we've found the tome.@0003@0011
@000CSir Douglas,
is this it...?@0003
@0009@0010@010AYes, it is.@0003
This is the Glorious Ascension,
Aureola, Saint Elimine's weapon.@0003
@000CMay we make
use of it?@0003
@0009The king said to take anything in
the tower that may be of use.@0003
The St. Elimine Church
backs us as well.@0003
If any oppose our use of it,
then I will negotiate.@0003
@000CThank you,
Sir Douglas.@0003
[0BEC]
@0009@0010@0152@000C@0010@0102@0009@0017Lord Roy,
I think we've found the tome.@0003@0011
@000C...This must be Aureola,
the Glorious Ascension.@0003
Merlinus,@0003@0009@0010@0154
@000CI want you to give this back
to the St. Elimine Church.@0003
@0009@0017Why?@0003
The king said we could take anything
we found in the tower.@0003
@000C@0017This is a holy relic of
their order.@0003
It would be sacrilegious to use it
without their permission.@0003
@0009I understand...@0003
[0BED]
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@0102
@0009@0017Lord Roy.@0003
@000CFather Yoder?
What is wrong?@0003
@0009I understand you found
the Aureola tome...@0003
@000CAh, yes.@0003
I will return it to the
church immediately.@0003
@0009There is no need.
We want you to take it.@0003
@000C@0017...Are you certain?@0003
@0009@0017What Saint Elimine wished
for was peace.@0003
Use it well and bring an
end to this war.@0003
@000CIf you insist.@0003
[0BEE]
@0009@0010@0152@000C@0010@01E0@0009@0017Sir Tick!
The enemy is advancing!@0003
@000C@0017Don't panic.@0003
The path through the
ruins is blocked off.@0003
They're not getting
in here so easily.@0003
@0009@0017
But the enemy has had so many
victories against Ilia's troops!@0003
Even many of our own men have
fallen to them.@0003
I don't see how we can expect
victory...!@0003
@000C@0017
We don't need a victory.@0003
General Murdock said that we
simply must hold our ground.@0003
We defend until the enemy
gives up and leaves.@0003

@000C@0010@0102@0017The legendary weapon lies in here...@0003
@0009@0010@0132@000CZelot, do you know
about this place?@0003
@0009Yes.@0003
I believe that Maltet, the Blizzard
Spear, lies in these ruins.@0003
@000CThe Blizzard Spear...@0003
@0009Barigan the Holy Knight used it
during the Scouring.@0003
@000CBarigan?
He's a hero to all knights.@0003
I studied him a great deal.@0003
He was honorable in
everything he did.@0003
...This building seems to
have walls everywhere.@0003
Is there a way inside?@0003
@0009
Bern's forces most likely blocked the
pathways to cover their tracks.@0003
@000CThen they must have been
in a rush...@0003
Maybe the walls are weak in
certain areas.@0003
@0009That is quite possible.@0003

Bern's troops are fleeing.@0003
@000CGood.
Let them go.@0003
@0009Let them go?
We must attack.@0003
@000CNo, don't.
We've already won.@0003
They don't want to
fight us.@0003

@0009@0010@0154
Lord Roy,
Bern's troops are fleeing.@0003
@000CGood.
Let them go.@0003
@0009Let them go?
We must attack.@0003
@000CNo, don't.
We've already won.@0003
They don't want to
fight us.@0003
@0009But...@0003
@000CThey all have lives
and families.@0003
There's no need to take
that away from them.@0003
[0C00]
@000C@0010@01C7@0009@0010@01D7@000C
The battle was lost...@0003
@0009Yes, it appears so.@0003
@000C
I wish I could have been at General
Murdock's side when he fell.@0003
@0009...I share your feelings.@0003
@000C
We carry out our final orders from
General Murdock as planned.@0003
We will defend the legendary weapon
to our deaths if need be.@0003
Apocalypse, the Elder Revelation,
must not fall into enemy hands!@0003
[0C01]
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@0102@0017
There is a legendary weapon
in this place?@0003
@0009Yes, I believe so.@0003
All I've heard are rumors from other
soldiers,@0003
but there is apparently a tome meant
to protect the shrine from intruders.@0003
@0009@0011@0008@0010@012B
I agree that the tome is
likely a legendary weapon.@0003
Bern's troops are present
as well.@0003
@000C
We will soon fight Zephiel himself.@0003
...We need as many legendary weapons
as we can obtain before then.@0003
We must get that tome.@0003
@0008@0011@0009@0010@012E
I have also heard that there are
numerous traps placed about.@0003
@000CTraps?@0003
@0009Yes, and they are supposedly
very well-crafted at that.@0003
Most of us probably lack the
dexterity to disarm them,@0003
but thieves may be able to
take care of them.@0003
In any case, do be careful.@0003
@000CYes, we must stay
on our guard.@0003

This is where the legendary weapon
is, Princess Guinivere?@0003
@0009Most likely...@0003
All I know is that there is a tome here
meant to protect the shrine from intruders.@0003

@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@012B@000C@0017Elffin, do you know what
this spell tome is?@0003
@0009...It is probably Apocalypse.@0003
@000CApocalypse?@0003
@0009Yes, it is also known as the
Elder Revelation.@0003
It was used by Bramimond, the most
enigmatic of the Eight Legends.@0003
@000CBramimond...@0003
I've heard the name,
but nothing more.@0003
@0009
We know not if Bramimond was
man or woman, young or old.@0003
Nothing specific is written.@0003
@000CThat's unusual...@0003
@0009@0016......@0003
@0009@0011@000A@0010@0157@0016Roy, is something wrong?@0003
@000CNo, I was just thinking.@0003
@000AAbout what?@0003
@000CThere always seem to be traps
where legendary weapons lie.@0003
@000A...Perhaps they are meant to keep
the unworthy from wielding them.@0003
@000CMaybe so...
But the traps are so intricate.@0003
I feel there must be something
more to them than that.@0003
@000A@0016......@0003@0016
@000A@0011@0009@0010@012B
...I have wondered the same thing.@0003
I shall see if there is any
information on the subject.@0003
@000CYes...
Thank you.@0003

Long ago, when the gods
were closer to men...
[0C09]
a great hero fought
to save mankind
with divine aid...
[0C0A]
In his possession
was a sword of light...
[0C0B]
to pierce the darkness...
[0C0C]
and a sacred emblem
of burning light,
born of flames...
[0C0D]
An emblem that surpasses
time and space...
